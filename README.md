# LLM-Behind-the-Wheel: Evaluating and Generating Safety-Critical Driving Scenarios
![Framework_page-0001](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/188eb383-0770-475c-8c83-e8a680d25ca3)

We propose a novel framework that employs LLM as an evaluation module to assess the safety-criticality of driving scenarios globally and at the agent level.
Additionally, we extend the framework to generate safety-critical scenarios through adversarial methods, enhancing the controllability of the newly generated trajectory.
