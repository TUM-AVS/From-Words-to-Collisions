Obstacle 341, although currently in a different lanelet, warrants continued observation due to its high speed and acceleration."
GRC_NeaSmyrni-117_1_T-6,False,False,False,[],,No collisions are detected or predicted within the given timeframe.  The ego vehicle maintains a safe distance from other obstacles in its lanelet and other obstacles are either stationary or moving away.
BEL_Brussels-82_4_T-1,True,False,True,[],30233.0,"Obstacle 30233.0 poses an extreme risk of collision due to its close proximity, its consistently positive acceleration, and the decreasing distance to the ego vehicle over the observed timesteps. If the current trend continues, a collision is highly likely."
DEU_Muehlhausen-10_5_T-1,False,False,False,[],,"No collisions are detected or predicted. All obstacles in the ego vehicle's lanelet are behind it with increasing separation, and obstacles in other lanelets maintain safe lateral and longitudinal distances. Trajectories and velocity profiles support this conclusion."
ESP_Barcelona-44_27_T-1,False,False,False,[],,"No obstacle is on a collision course with the ego vehicle. All obstacles maintain safe distances and/or are in different lanelets with non-intersecting trajectories.  A comprehensive analysis of positions, orientations, velocities, and accelerations over 10 timesteps confirms the absence of any collision risk."
CHN_Qingdao-18_2_T-1,False,False,False,[],,"While no collision has occurred within the provided 0.9 seconds of data, Obstacle 30659.0 presents a very high risk of a near miss or potential collision due to its proximity to the ego vehicle and their relative velocities.  Obstacle 30658.0 and 30655.0 should also be considered at increased risk of a near-miss or collision and be monitored further, though they do not yet pose an *extreme* risk."
ESP_Barcelona-39_27_T-1,False,False,False,[],,"No collision is detected or predicted.  Obstacle 30810, initially the most concerning due to sharing the same lane, maintains a safe distance ahead of the ego vehicle and decelerates, mitigating risk. Obstacle 30808's lane change and deceleration also reduce risk. Other obstacles remain in different lanes or at safe distances."
DEU_Memmingen-138_1_T-4,False,False,False,[],,"No collisions were detected or are predicted. While obstacle 20035 was initially close, its trajectory diverged from the ego's.  Other obstacles maintained safe distances and/or decelerated, preventing any collision risk."
DEU_Bremen-1_10_T-1,False,False,False,[],,"The ego vehicle changes lanes from 464 to 1641, diverging from the paths of all other vehicles.  Analysis of relative positions, velocities, and accelerations over the 10 timesteps confirms no collision has occurred or is imminent."
DEU_Nuremberg-30_6_T-1,False,False,False,[],,"No collision has occurred. Obstacle 30603.0 poses the highest risk, being in the same lane and ahead of the ego vehicle. However, the substantial separation distance and decreasing relative velocity suggest a collision is not imminent at this time. Continuous monitoring is necessary to assess the future risk."
ITA_Siderno-5_3_T-1,False,False,False,[],,"While no collision has occurred yet, obstacle 344 poses a significant risk of a future rear-end collision due to its higher velocity and closing distance to the ego vehicle within the same lane.  Continuous monitoring and appropriate action are needed to mitigate this risk."
