## Collision Scenarios:
- GRC_NeaSmyrni-87_1_T-1: The ego vehicle is approaching a stationary obstacle (20039.0) in the same lanelet.  While the ego vehicle is decelerating, the continuous motion towa...
- ESP_Barcelona-12_43_T-1: Obstacle 30716 is in the same lane, at high speed, and rapidly approaching the ego vehicle, making a collision highly probable if current trajectories...
- ESP_Barcelona-44_19_T-1: Obstacle 30743.0 is in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle and is rapidly approaching from behind due to its higher acceleration. If the ego vehicle d...
- DEU_Salzwedel-80_1_T-2: Obstacle 20039.0 presents a high risk of collision due to its trajectory intersecting the ego vehicle's projected path, combined with their relative v...
- DEU_Backnang-2_1_T-1: Obstacle 33 poses a high risk of collision due to its continuous approach towards the ego vehicle within the same lanelet, its higher velocity and pos...
- BEL_Antwerp-13_5_T-1: Obstacle 30675.0 poses an extreme risk of collision due to its proximity, relative velocity and consistent approach towards the ego vehicle over the o...
- BEL_Brussels-82_4_T-1: Obstacle 30233.0 poses an extreme risk of collision due to its close proximity, its consistently positive acceleration, and the decreasing distance to...
