# Discrepancy Analysis Summary

## Dataset Statistics
Total scenarios in annotations: 104
Scenarios processed: 103
Collision scenarios (model prediction): 1 (0.97%)
Extreme risk scenarios (model prediction): 6 (5.83%)
Scenarios with JSON format: 103 (100.00%)
Scenarios with text-only format: 0 (0.00%)

## Identification Accuracy
Correctly identified as ONLY collision: 0 (0.00%)
Correctly identified as extreme risk: 0 (0.00%)
Correctly identified as either collision or extreme risk: 0 (0.00%)

## Detailed Analysis
Scenarios where annotated obstacle is the ONLY collision ID: 0 (0.00%)
Scenarios where annotated obstacle is in collision IDs (may be multiple): 0 (0.00%)
Scenarios where annotated obstacle is the extreme risk obstacle: 0 (0.00%)
Scenarios where annotated obstacle is either the ONLY collision ID or is the extreme risk obstacle: 0 (0.00%)

## JSON Format Performance
JSON format scenarios: 103
Correctly identified in JSON format: 0 (0.00%)

## Missing Scenarios
