Here's the collision risk analysis for the provided scenario:

**Analysis:**

* **Obstacle 341:** This obstacle is in a different lanelet (3560) than the ego vehicle (5459), suggesting they are on different, non-intersecting paths.  Although the y-coordinates are somewhat close, the x-coordinates show a significant and increasing separation over time.  This obstacle poses no immediate risk. Risk score: 5

* **Obstacle 357:** This obstacle is in the same lanelet (5459) as the ego vehicle. Initially, it is behind the ego vehicle but moving faster. Over the time steps, its x-position gets closer to the ego vehicle's. Although the distances are still safe, the closing rate needs monitoring. Risk score: 3.

* **Obstacle 360:** Similar to Obstacle 341, this obstacle is in a different lanelet (3560). The trajectories show no potential for intersection.  Risk score: 5.

* **Obstacle 3104:** This obstacle is in a different lanelet (3838) and its trajectory shows no sign of intersection with the ego vehicle's path.  The y-coordinates are different enough that there's no concern. Risk score: 5.

* **Obstacle 3111:**  This obstacle appears at t=2.1s in lanelet 4812. It starts relatively far from the ego vehicle but is moving with a high velocity. This combined with its lanelet may indicate a potential crossing or merging point. Risk score: 4.
