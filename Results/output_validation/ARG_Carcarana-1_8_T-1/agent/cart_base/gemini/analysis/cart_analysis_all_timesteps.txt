Obstacle 341: This obstacle is in a different lanelet (3560) than the ego vehicle (5459), and their y-coordinates are significantly different. While the x-coordinates appear to be converging, the different lanelets and the consistent difference in y-coordinates suggest they are on different, likely parallel, paths.  Therefore, the risk is negligible.

Obstacle 357: This obstacle is in the same lanelet (5459) as the ego vehicle.  Initially, the obstacle is slightly behind the ego vehicle. Throughout the provided timesteps, the x and y coordinates are relatively close. While obstacle 357 moves slightly closer to the ego vehicle over time, the relative velocities and small changes in position suggest a low risk of collision. The ego vehicle's velocity is slightly slower than obstacle 357, so 357 is gradually overtaking the ego vehicle. However, there is no immediate danger based on the given trajectory.

Obstacle 360: Similar to obstacle 341, this obstacle is in a different lanelet (3560) and maintains a consistent separation in the y-coordinate from the ego vehicle. The converging x-coordinates are not a concern given the separate lanelets. Thus, the risk is negligible.

Obstacle 3104: This obstacle is in a different lanelet (3838) and has a significantly different y-coordinate from the ego vehicle.  Its x-coordinate is also consistently greater than the ego vehicle’s. There is no indication of a potential collision, so the risk is negligible.

Obstacle 3111:  This obstacle appears at t=2.1s. It's in a different lanelet (4812) and its y-coordinate is relatively close to the ego vehicle’s.  However, the x-coordinate is consistently and significantly greater than the ego vehicle’s. There is no indication of convergence or a path intersection. Therefore, the risk is negligible.
