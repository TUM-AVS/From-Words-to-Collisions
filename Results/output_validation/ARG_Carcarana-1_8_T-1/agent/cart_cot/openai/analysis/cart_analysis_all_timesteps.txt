Upon analyzing the scenario, let's evaluate the potential risk levels of each obstacle in relation to the ego vehicle at the latest timestamp (2.9 seconds):

1. **Ego Vehicle**: Position is (-156.7237, -60.8573) and it is moving at a velocity of roughly 2.196 m/s. 

2. **Obstacle 341.0**:
   - Position: (-151.0472, -63.067397)
   - Velocity: 8.8969316 m/s
   - This obstacle is moving quickly and in a similar direction to the ego, possibly closing in on the ego vehicle. The proximity and relative speed can lead to a collision soon if corrective actions aren't taken.

3. **Obstacle 357.0**:
   - Position: (-159.89481, -64.003964)
   - Velocity: 2.797431 m/s
   - This obstacle is in the same lanelet as the ego at 2.8 seconds and moving with a relatively low velocity. However, it doesn't pose a high immediate risk due to its slightly slower velocity and trajectory.

4. **Obstacle 360.0**:
   - Position: (-139.27265, -65.550227)
   - Velocity: 6.7400873 m/s
   - This obstacle is further away in terms of Y-coordinate and increasing its distance, indicating a low risk of immediate collision.

5. **Obstacle 3104.0**:
   - Position: (-164.54498, -32.942517)
   - Velocity: 9.0910261 m/s
   - Moving in a different lanelet and direction. Despite its speed, the risk of collision is negligible due to lane differences.

6. **Obstacle 3111.0**:
   - Position: (-178.49212, -60.864734)
   - Velocity: 9.1067434 m/s
   - While fast, it is in a different lane and its trajectory diverges significantly from the ego.

After reviewing these, focus particularly on Obstacle 341.0, which shows potential for risk due to its velocity and trajectory aligning with the ego. Here is the structured JSON output summarizing key risk levels:

```json
{
    "CollisionObstacles": [],
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "341.0",
        "OverallRiskScore": 1
    },
    "HighRiskObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "357.0",
        "OverallRiskScore": 2
    }
}
```

**Explanation for Risk Levels**:
- **Obstacle 341.0**: At Extreme Risk due to its high speed and trajectory towards the ego, with potential for imminent collision.
- **Obstacle 357.0**: At High Risk mainly due to its location in the same lanelet and potential for collision depending on its trajectory changes.
