Obstacle 357 is in the same lane as the ego vehicle and is moving slower than the ego vehicle.  The distance between them is decreasing, indicating a potential risk. However, at the last timestep (2.9s), obstacle 357 is still 3.8 meters ahead of the ego vehicle laterally, suggesting the risk is not immediate.  We need to monitor this obstacle in subsequent timesteps to assess if the risk level increases.

Obstacle 341 and 360 are in a different lanelet than the ego vehicle, but their trajectories and relatively high speeds compared to the ego vehicle warrant attention.

Obstacle 3104 and 3111 are relatively far from the ego vehicle and do not present an immediate risk. However, their high speeds and changing orientation should be noted for future timesteps.
