To analyze the described scenario, we will calculate the time to collision (TTC) and the minimum distance to collision (MDC) for each obstacle relative to the ego vehicle. We will use the positions, velocities, and headings to determine the potential risk level. Here's a detailed step-through based on the last timestep (2.9 seconds):

### Analysis:

**Ego Vehicle at 2.9 seconds:**
- Position: (-156.7237, -60.8573)
- Velocity: 2.196 m/s
- Orientation: 2.736581378716448 radians

**Obstacle Analysis at 2.9 seconds:**

1. **Obstacle 341.0:**
   - Position: (-151.0472, -63.067397)
   - Velocity: 8.8969316 m/s
   - Orientation: 2.933906 radians
   - Relative longitudinal position and velocity indicate a closing gap.
   - Lateral distance is significant, potentially indicating a lane change or different lane.
   - **Risk Assessment:** Although the lateral distance reduces risk, the speed and trajectory are concerning. Needs monitoring.
   - **Calculated Risk Level: Medium (3)**

2. **Obstacle 357.0:**
   - Position: (-159.89481, -64.003964)
   - Velocity: 2.797431 m/s
   - Orientation: 5.8300146 radians
   - This obstacle is in the same lanelet and approaching.
   - Short longitudinal gap and low speed differential pose a higher risk.
   - **Risk Assessment: Extreme (1)**
   - **Reason:** This obstacle is in the same lanelet and is not far from the ego vehicle. With the vehicle approaching, an imminent collision is likely if no corrective action is taken.

3. **Obstacle 360.0:**
   - Position: (-139.27265, -65.550227)
   - Velocity: 6.7400873 m/s
   - Orientation: 2.9336649 radians
   - Positioned in a different lanelet, showing significant lateral distance.
   - **Risk Assessment:** Lateral positioning reduces risk. Requires monitoring, but not immediately threatening.
   - **Calculated Risk Level: Low (4)**

4. **Obstacle 3104.0:**
   - Position: (-164.54498, -32.942517)
   - Velocity: 9.0910261 m/s
   - Orientation: 1.3697556 radians
   - High speed, but significantly positioned away laterally.
   - **Risk Assessment:** Despite high speed, safe lateral distance. Monitoring is necessary.
   - **Calculated Risk Level: Low (4)**

5. **Obstacle 3111.0:**
   - Position: (-178.49212, -60.864734)
   - Velocity: 9.1067434 m/s
   - Orientation: 6.0755809 radians
   - Located in a different lanelet with considerable distance longitudinally.
   - **Risk Assessment:** Safe owing to sufficient distance. 
   - **Calculated Risk Level: Low (4)**

### JSON Output:
```json
{
    "CollisionObstacles": [],
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "357.0",
        "OverallRiskScore": 1
    },
    "HighRiskObstacle": null
}
```

This analysis indicates obstacle 357.0 poses the highest risk, requiring immediate attention, while no collision or high-risk obstacles are present at this time.
