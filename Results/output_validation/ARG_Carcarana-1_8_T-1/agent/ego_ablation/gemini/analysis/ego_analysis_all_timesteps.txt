At timestamp 2.9 seconds, the following analysis is observed for each obstacle:

* **Obstacle 341:** Located behind the ego vehicle at -1.58m longitudinally, approaching at 6.53 m/s.  Given the closing velocity and proximity, a collision is imminent.  MDC is < 0.5m and TTC is < 0.5s. *Overall Risk Score: 0 (Collision)*

* **Obstacle 357:** Located slightly left of the ego vehicle at 2.53m laterally. While longitudinally aligned (0.0m), the lateral distance suggests no immediate collision risk.  MDC is >0.5m, but < 1.0m. While the longitudinal velocity indicates closing, the lateral offset makes a collision unlikely without a sudden ego lane change. *Overall Risk Score: 2 (High Risk)*

* **Obstacle 360:** Located behind and to the right of the ego vehicle at -13.38m longitudinally and -0.95m laterally. Closing velocity is high, though current distances are greater than concerning thresholds and sufficient to avoid a collision if course corrected. *Overall Risk Score: 3 (Medium Risk)*

* **Obstacle 3104:** Located far ahead and to the right of the ego vehicle (13.68m longitudinally, -20.96m laterally) and moving further away laterally. No immediate risk. *Overall Risk Score: 5 (Negligible Risk)*

* **Obstacle 3111:** Located ahead and to the left (15.50m longitudinally, 6.97m laterally) and approaching at -11.13 m/s longitudinally.  While the closing speed is high, the distance is sufficient to react. The lateral movement suggests a low probability of collision. *Overall Risk Score: 3 (Medium Risk)*
