At t=2.9s:
- **Obstacle 341**: Located behind the ego vehicle at -1.58m longitudinal distance, approaching at 6.53 m/s.  Given the short distance and high closing velocity, this obstacle represents an extreme risk of collision. Risk score: 1.

- **Obstacle 357**: Located beside the ego vehicle, at 0.0m longitudinal and 2.53m lateral distance. While longitudinally aligned, it's moving away laterally and poses no immediate threat. Risk score: 3.

- **Obstacle 360**: Located behind and to the right at -13.38m longitudinal and -0.95m lateral.  It is approaching at 4.41 m/s longitudinally and 1.32 m/s laterally. While approaching, there is still a safe distance to react. Risk score: 3.

- **Obstacle 3104**: Located in the front-right, 13.68m longitudinal and -20.96m lateral. It is moving away laterally at high speed (-8.90 m/s), and slightly approaching longitudinally (-0.35 m/s). No immediate risk. Risk score: 4.

- **Obstacle 3111**: Located front-left, 15.50m longitudinal and 6.97 lateral. It is approaching longitudinally at -11.13 m/s and laterally at -1.79 m/s. This represents a high risk due to the closing velocity, despite the larger longitudinal distance. Risk score: 2.



Risk Levels:
0: Collision - Physical contact occurred or unavoidable
1: Extreme Risk - Immediate collision likely
2: High Risk - Close to collision, needs quick action
3: Medium Risk - Manageable with proper reaction
4: Low Risk - Minimal risk, sufficient time to react
5: Negligible Risk - No significant risk
