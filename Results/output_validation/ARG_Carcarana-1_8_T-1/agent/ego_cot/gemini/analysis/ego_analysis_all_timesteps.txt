### Safety analysis for timestep 2.9s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

**Assumptions and Calculations:**

Since the provided scenario lacks ego vehicle dimensions and precise obstacle dimensions, I'll assume a simplified collision box for both the ego vehicle and obstacles as a point. This means I will use the raw longitudinal and lateral distances provided directly for risk assessment.  In a real-world scenario, more sophisticated calculations involving vehicle dimensions, shapes, and orientations would be necessary. Also since the provided data does not include explicit TTC values, I'll make estimations based on the available distance and velocity information. These estimations will follow the general TTC calculation: TTC = Distance / Relative Velocity. Iâ€™ll calculate both TTClong and TTClat separately. MDC will be equal to the smallest distance between the ego and obstacle.

**Adjusted Distance (MDC Calculation):**

Due to the lack of information about vehicle sizes, I will assume adjusted distance is equal to the given distance from the center of the ego vehicle to the center of the obstacle. To calculate MDC, I'll use the following formula:  MDC = sqrt(DTClong^2 + DTClat^2).

### Obstacle Analysis:

**- Obstacle ID: 341**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 341 is very close behind the ego vehicle (-1.58m longitudinally, -1.58m laterally). Its motion indicates it is approaching rapidly from behind and laterally from the right.
- Distance safety score: 1 (Extreme Risk)
- Time Risk reason: Given the high closing velocity (6.53 m/s longitudinally, 1.74 m/s laterally), TTC is very low.
- Time safety score: 1 (Extreme Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 1 (Extreme Risk)

**- Obstacle ID: 357**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 357 has an extremely low MDC of near zero (0.00 m longitudinally and laterally).
- Distance safety score: 0 (Collision Risk)
- Time Risk reason: With the longitudinal relative velocity of -4.99 m/s, collision is imminent.
- Time safety score: 0 (Collision Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 0 (Collision Risk)

**- Obstacle ID: 360**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 360 is relatively far from the ego vehicle (-13.38m longitudinally, -13.38m laterally) and positioned to the rear-right.
- Distance safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- Time Risk reason: The moderate closing velocity (4.41 m/s longitudinally, 1.32 m/s laterally) and distance suggest ample time to react.
- Time safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 5 (Negligible Risk)

**- Obstacle ID: 3104**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 3104 is located far from the ego vehicle (13.68m longitudinally, 13.68m laterally) in the front-right quadrant.
- Distance safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- Time Risk reason: The lateral motion of the obstacle (-8.90 m/s) and relatively stable longitudinal motion suggest no immediate risk.
- Time safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 5 (Negligible Risk)


**- Obstacle ID: 3111**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 3111 is relatively far (15.50m longitudinally and laterally) in the front-left.
- Distance safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- Time Risk reason: Although approaching longitudinally (-11.13 m/s), the distance provides sufficient time to react.
- Time safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
