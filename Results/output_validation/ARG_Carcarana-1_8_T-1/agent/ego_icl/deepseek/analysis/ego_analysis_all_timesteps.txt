Let me analyze each obstacle at the most recent timestep (2.9 seconds) with trajectory context:

1. Obstacle 341 (Behind):
   - Current: longitudinal -1.58m (closing at 6.53m/s), lateral 0.00m (closing at 1.74m/s)
   - Trajectory: Rapidly approaching from directly behind (lateral alignment)
   - TTC_long: 1.58/6.53 = 0.24s (Extreme Risk)
   - TTC_lat: 0.00/1.74 = 0s (Collision Risk)
   - MDC: 0m (direct rear impact imminent)
   - Risk: 0 (Collision)

2. Obstacle 357 (Left):
   - Current: longitudinal 0.00m (closing at -4.99m/s), lateral 2.53m (moving away at 0.13m/s)
   - Trajectory: Side-swiping left side but moving away laterally
   - TTC_long: Not applicable (already aligned)
   - TTC_lat: Not applicable (diverging)
   - MDC: 2.53m (safe lateral distance)
   - Risk: 5 (No Risk)

3. Obstacle 360 (Rear-right):
   - Current: longitudinal -13.38m (closing at 4.41m/s), lateral -0.95m (closing at 1.32m/s)
   - Trajectory: Approaching from rear-right but still distant
   - TTC_long: 13.38/4.41 = 3.03s (Medium Risk)
   - TTC_lat: 0.95/1.32 = 0.72s (High Risk)
   - MDC: 0.95m (High Risk)
   - Risk: 2 (High Risk)

4. Obstacle 3104 (Front-right):
   - Current: longitudinal 13.68m (closing at -0.35m/s), lateral -20.96m (moving away at 8.90m/s)
   - Trajectory: Moving diagonally away
   - TTC: Not applicable (diverging in both dimensions)
   - MDC: >5m in both dimensions
   - Risk: 5 (No Risk)

5. Obstacle 3111 (Front-left):
   - Current: longitudinal 15.50m (closing at -11.13m/s), lateral 6.97m (closing at -1.79m/s)
   - Trajectory: Approaching diagonally but still distant
   - TTC_long: 15.50/11.13 = 1.39s (Medium Risk)
   - TTC_lat: 6.97/1.79 = 3.89s (Low Risk)
   - MDC: 6.97m (Low Risk)
   - Risk: 3 (Medium Risk)

JSON Summary:
```json
{
    "CollisionObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "341",
        "OverallRiskScore": "0"
    },
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "341",
        "OverallRiskScore": "1"
    },
    "PredictedCollisionObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "341",
        "OverallRiskScore": "0"
    }
}
```

Key Findings:
- Obstacle 341 is in imminent collision (0.24s TTC) from directly behind with 0m lateral offset
- No other obstacles pose immediate collision threat
- Obstacle 360 shows high risk but is still >1s away
- All other obstacles are at medium or lower risk levels
