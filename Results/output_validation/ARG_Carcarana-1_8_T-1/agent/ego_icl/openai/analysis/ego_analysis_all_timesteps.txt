Below is the analysis of each obstacle at the most recent timestep (2.9 seconds) using the adjusted distances:

### Obstacle 341 (Behind):
- **Position**: Behind, aligned laterally with ego vehicle (adjusted lateral = 0.00m).
- **Trajectory and Metrics**:
  - Longitudinal distance is -1.58m, decreasing as it approaches.
  - Relative longitudinal velocity = 6.53 m/s (approaching), lateral velocity = 1.74 m/s.
- **Calculation**:
  - **TTC (longitudinal)** = |(-1.58)|/6.53 ≈ 0.24 seconds.
  - **MDC** is at exactly 0.00m laterally, small longitudinal distance, and no separation.
- **Risk Assessment**: With TTC < 0.5s due to the closing velocity and trajectory, the risk is classified as Extreme (1).

### Obstacle 357 (Left):
- **Position**: Left, zero longitudinal adjusted distance (aligned alongside).
- **Trajectory and Metrics**:
  - Lateral distance is 2.53m, increasing slightly.
  - Relative longitudinal velocity = -4.99 m/s (moving away longitudinally), lateral velocity = 0.13 m/s (moving away laterally).
- **Calculation**:
  - **MDC** = 2.53m, relative motion indicates separation.
- **Risk Assessment**: No risk due to separation trajectory, despite exact longitudinal alignment, as lateral distance is not closing.

### Obstacle 360 (Rear-right):
- **Position**: Rear-right.
- **Trajectory and Metrics**:
  - Longitudinal distance is -13.38 m; lateral distance is -0.95 m.
  - Closing longitudinal velocity = 4.41 m/s; closing lateral velocity = 1.32 m/s.
- **Calculation**:
  - **TTC (lateral)** = |-0.95|/1.32 ≈ 0.72 seconds.
  - **MDC** = 0.95m (lateral is limiting factor).
- **Risk Assessment**: High risk due to the close lateral distance and relative closure speed (2).

### Obstacle 3104 (Front-right):
- **Position**: Front-right, diverging laterally.
- **Trajectory and Metrics**:
  - Longitudinal distance is 13.68 m; diverging laterally at -20.96 m.
  - Lateral velocity indicates movement away (-8.90 m/s).
- **Calculation**:
  - **TTC and MDC** too large to consider imminent collision.
- **Risk Assessment**: No significant risk due to diverging paths.

### Obstacle 3111 (Front-left):
- **Position**: Front-left.
- **Trajectory and Metrics**:
  - Longitudinal distance is 15.50 m; lateral distance is 6.97 m.
  - Approaching longitudinal velocity = -11.13 m/s, closing laterally = -1.79 m/s.
- **Calculation**:
  - **TTC (longitudinal)** = 15.50/|-11.13| ≈ 1.39 seconds.
  - **TTC (lateral)** = 6.97/|-1.79| ≈ 3.90 seconds.
  - **MDC** comfortably large due to distances.
- **Risk Assessment**: Medium risk due to larger longitudinal distance but fast approach speed.

    },
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "341",

        "ObstacleID": "360",
        "OverallRiskScore": "2"
    }
}
```

In conclusion, no obstacle is in a collision state, but Obstacle 341 presents an extreme risk due to precise lateral alignment and rapidly closing distance, while Obstacle 360 is a high risk due to the minimal lateral spacing and closing trajectory.
