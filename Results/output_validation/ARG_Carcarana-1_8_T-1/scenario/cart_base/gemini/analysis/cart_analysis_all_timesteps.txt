Obstacle 341 is in a different lanelet (3560) than the ego vehicle (5459), suggesting they are on different roads or separated by a median/barrier.  While 341's velocity and acceleration are higher than the ego's, the lateral separation suggests a low risk of collision.

Obstacle 357 is in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle (5459).  It is relatively close to the ego, and although the current velocity difference isn't large, 357's orientation (5.88 rad) suggests it may be facing the wrong way or performing an unusual maneuver. This combined with the close proximity raises the risk level. This obstacle requires close monitoring due to the potential for unpredictable behavior.

Obstacle 360 is in a different lanelet (3560). Similar to 341, the lateral separation suggests low collision risk despite the difference in velocity and acceleration.

Obstacles 3104 and 3111 are in different lanelets (3838 and 4812, respectively) and are relatively far from the ego vehicle, suggesting low risk despite their higher velocities.
