### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 341.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 341.0 is in a different lanelet (3560.0) than the ego vehicle (5459.0).  While its Y-coordinate is relatively close to the ego vehicle, the X-coordinate shows a significant lateral separation.  The historical data shows it moving further away in the X direction.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: The obstacle's velocity is higher than the ego vehicle's, and it's accelerating, but its trajectory is diverging from the ego vehicle's path.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 357.0
- Distance Risk reason: This obstacle is in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle.  It is behind the ego vehicle. Historical data shows it getting closer but remains behind.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: It is traveling slower and it's accelerating at a slower rate as well.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- Obstacle ID: 360.0
- Distance Risk reason: Similar to obstacle 341.0, this obstacle is in a different lanelet and moving further away in X.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason:  It is traveling faster than ego, and accelerating, but diverging trajectory mitigates risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 3104.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 3104.0 is in a different lanelet and its Y-coordinate shows significant separation, indicating no immediate risk. The historical data confirms it is moving further away in Y direction.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Its high velocity and acceleration are not a concern given its diverging trajectory away from the ego vehicle.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 3111.0
- Distance Risk reason: This obstacle is located in a different lanelet and its Y-coordinate indicates some separation, but closer to the ego vehicle than others. Historical data show a diverging path, but continued monitoring may be required.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Although it has high velocity and acceleration, its trajectory is diverging from the ego vehicle's path, reducing the risk over time.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. **Most critical obstacles:** Obstacle 357.0, as it's in the same lanelet and behind the ego vehicle, and 3111.0, due to its proximity but diverging path.
2. **Trajectory analysis:** Over the 10 timesteps, obstacle 357.0 remains behind the ego vehicle, gradually getting closer. Obstacle 3111.0 consistently moves in a different lane.  Other obstacles clearly move away from the ego vehicle's trajectory.
3. **Relative positions, velocities, and accelerations:**  Obstacle 357.0 is slower and accelerating slower than the ego vehicle. 3111.0 is moving away laterally.
4. **Collision determination:** No collision has occurred or is imminent based on current data.
5. **Reasoning:** Although some obstacles are relatively close, their trajectories, combined with their velocities and accelerations, do not indicate a collision scenario.  Obstacle 357 poses no immediate threat as it stays behind the ego vehicle, though monitoring its approach is advised.  Obstacle 3111 is diverging so doesn't pose a direct threat.


### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
  "CollisionObstacles": null,
  "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null,
  "ScenarioAnalysis": {
    "IsCollisionScenario": false,
    "Reasoning": "No obstacle poses an immediate collision risk. Obstacle 357 is in the same lane but behind and moving slower than the ego vehicle. Obstacle 3111 is relatively close but diverging into a different lane.  All other obstacles have trajectories that move them away from the ego vehicle over the analyzed time period."
