### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 341.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is in a different lanelet and moving away from the ego vehicle.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason:  Relative velocity and acceleration suggest no risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 357.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is in the same lanelet and relatively close, but moving in the opposite direction.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: The opposite direction of travel significantly reduces the risk.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
This is not a collision scenario. No obstacles are on a collision course with the ego vehicle. All obstacles are either in different lanelets, moving away, or traveling in opposite directions, minimizing the risk of collision.
