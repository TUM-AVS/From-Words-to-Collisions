### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep:
Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 341.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is on an approaching trajectory towards the ego vehicle with a small lateral separation.
  - **Distance safety score**: 3
  - **Time Risk reason**: Given its high and increasing velocity and consistent trajectory towards the ego vehicle, there is a moderate time-based collision risk.
  - **Time safety score**: 3
  - **Overall Risk score**: 3

- **Obstacle ID: 357.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is in the same lanelet as the ego and is slightly ahead but could potentially intersect the ego's path.
  - **Distance safety score**: 2
  - **Time Risk reason**: Low velocity and minimal acceleration reduce the immediate time risk slightly, but the close proximity requires attention.
  - **Time safety score**: 3
  - **Overall Risk score**: 3

- **Obstacle ID: 360.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle remains in a different lanelet, continually moving in a parallel path, suggesting no immediate threat.
  - **Distance safety score**: 5
  - **Time Risk reason**: Though it has a consistent and increasing velocity, its path does not converge with that of the ego vehicle.
  - **Time safety score**: 5
  - **Overall Risk score**: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 3104.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Located far from the ego vehicle with no intersecting path, possessing high velocity but in a different trajectory.
  - **Distance safety score**: 5
  - **Time Risk reason**: The trajectory and high velocity do not suggest a threat to the ego due to the differing lanelet.
  - **Time safety score**: 5
  - **Overall Risk score**: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 3111.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Consistently in a different lanelet and moving away.
  - **Distance safety score**: 5
  - **Time Risk reason**: Although moving quickly, the trajectory has never approached that of the ego vehicle.
  - **Time safety score**: 5
  - **Overall Risk score**: 5

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
- **Step 1**: Identify potential threats by examining the positions, velocities, and lanelets of obstacles. 
- **Step 2**: Compute relative positions and TTC to assess if any obstacles are within a collision course.
- **Step 3**: Determine risk scores for both distance and time-based measures.
- **Step 4**: Evaluate all findings and deduce composite risks for the scenario.
