Obstacle 341 is behind the ego vehicle and approaching rapidly.  At the last timestep (3.1 seconds), it is only 0.21 meters behind longitudinally and has a high relative longitudinal velocity (7.10 m/s). This indicates a very high risk of imminent collision.

Obstacle 357 is alongside the ego vehicle (lateral distance 2.52 m) at the last timestep. Although it maintains a longitudinal alignment (relative longitudinal distance â‰ˆ 0m) and closing velocity, the lateral separation suggests it poses less of an immediate risk than Obstacle 341. 

Obstacle 360, while approaching the ego vehicle, is still relatively far (-12.50 m longitudinally). It does not present an immediate collision risk.

Obstacle 3111 is also further away (13.44m longitudinally) from the ego vehicle. While its motion suggests an eventual approach, it does not pose an immediate danger.

Therefore, Obstacle 341 is assessed as the extreme risk obstacle.
