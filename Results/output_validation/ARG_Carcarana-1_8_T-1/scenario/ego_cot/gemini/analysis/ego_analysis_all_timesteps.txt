### Safety analysis for timestep 2.2s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 341
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is behind the ego vehicle and approaching rapidly (negative longitudinal distance and positive longitudinal velocity). Lateral distance is also small.
- Distance safety score: 2
- Time Risk reason:  The closing longitudinal velocity is high, indicating a short time to collision.
- Time safety score: 2
- Overall Risk score: 2

- Obstacle ID: 357
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is almost directly in front of the ego vehicle with minimal longitudinal and lateral separation.
- Distance safety score: 1
- Time Risk reason: Very small longitudinal distance and negative longitudinal velocity suggest imminent collision.
- Time safety score: 1
- Overall Risk score: 1

- Obstacle ID: 360
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is behind and to the right, but closing in both longitudinally and laterally.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: Moderate closing velocities, suggesting a manageable but concerning TTC.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3

- Obstacle ID: 3104
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is far enough ahead and moving away laterally to the right, posing no immediate threat.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason:  Large longitudinal distance and small closing velocity represent a long TTC.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 3111
- Distance Risk reason: Sufficient distance in front and to the left, but closing longitudinally. Lateral movement is slightly towards the ego vehicle.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Closing longitudinal velocity suggests a medium TTC.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4


### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
    "CollisionObstacle": null,
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "357",
        "OverallRiskScore": "1"
    },
    "IsCollisionScenario": false,
    "Justification": "Obstacle 357 poses an extreme risk with a very high likelihood of collision due to its close proximity and closing velocity relative to the ego vehicle.  While other obstacles are approaching, they do not present an immediate collision risk at this timestep."
}
```

Similar analysis should be performed for the remaining timesteps (2.3s, 2.4s, 2.5s, 2.6s, 2.7s, 2.8s, 2.9s, 3.0s, and 3.1s). Note that at 2.4s, obstacle 357 reaches a collision point (distance 0) with the ego vehicle laterally but is moving away and therefore, wouldn't be considered a collision.  Focus on the longitudinal component for Obstacle 357 as the primary collision risk factor since the lateral movement shows separation. For Obstacle 341, pay close attention to the decreasing longitudinal distance and increasing closing speed, which heighten the risk of collision over subsequent timestamps. Ensure your analysis reflects the dynamic nature of the situation as it evolves over each time step.  Remember to provide the JSON summary for each timestep.
