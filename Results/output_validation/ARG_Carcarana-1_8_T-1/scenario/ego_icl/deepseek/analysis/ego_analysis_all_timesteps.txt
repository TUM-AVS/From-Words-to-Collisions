Let me analyze the most recent timestep (3.1 seconds) with trajectory context from previous timesteps:

**Obstacle 341 (Behind):**
- Longitudinal: -0.21m (directly behind ego)
- Lateral: 0.00m (perfect alignment)
- Relative velocity: 7.10 m/s (rapidly approaching)
- TTC: 0.21/7.10 = 0.03 seconds (Extreme Risk)
- MDC: 0.21m (Extreme Risk)
- Trajectory: Consistently closing distance at increasing speed
- Risk: 0 (Collision occurring - distance < 0.5m with TTC < 0.5s)

**Obstacle 357 (Left):**
- Longitudinal: 0.00m (side-by-side)
- Lateral: 2.52m
- Relative velocity: -5.04 m/s (longitudinal), 0.06 m/s (lateral)
- TTC: N/A (moving away longitudinally)
- MDC: 2.52m (Low Risk)
- Risk: 4 (Low Risk)

**Obstacle 360 (Rear-Right):**
- Longitudinal: -12.50m
- Lateral: -0.27m
- Relative velocity: 4.88 m/s, 1.23 m/s
- TTC: 0.27/1.23 = 0.22s (lateral), 12.50/4.88 = 2.56s (longitudinal)
- MDC: 0.27m (Extreme Risk)
- Risk: 1 (Extreme Risk due to imminent lateral collision)

**Obstacle 3111 (Front-Left):**
- Longitudinal: 13.44m
- Lateral: 6.16m
- Relative velocity: -11.54 m/s, -1.63 m/s
- TTC: 13.44/11.54 = 1.16s (longitudinal)
- MDC: 6.16m (No Risk)
- Risk: 3 (Medium Risk)

**Collision Scenario Determination:**
- Obstacle 341 is actively colliding (distance < 0.5m with TTC ≈ 0)
- Obstacle 360 shows extreme lateral risk (MDC < 0.5m with TTC < 0.5s)

```json
{
    "CollisionObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "341",
        "OverallRiskScore": "0"
    },
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "360",
        "OverallRiskScore": "1"
    },
    "IsCollisionScenario": true,
    "Justification": "Obstacle 341 is actively colliding with the ego vehicle from behind (distance < 0.5m, TTC ≈ 0s), while Obstacle 360 shows extreme lateral collision risk (MDC < 0.5m with TTC < 0.5s)"
}
