### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
    - Obstacle ID: 341
    - Relative Direction: Behind
    - Distance Risk Reason: DTClong is -0.21m, indicating a very close proximity behind the ego vehicle.  The obstacle has been consistently approaching from behind over the past several timesteps.
    - Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 1
    - Lateral Distance Safety Score: 5
    - Overall Distance Safety Score: 1.0
    - Time Risk Reason: TTClong is 0.03s, indicating extremely high risk of collision. The TTC has been decreasing rapidly over the past several timesteps, confirming the imminent collision risk.
    - Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 1
    - Lateral Time Safety Score: 5
    - Overall Time Safety Score: 1.0
    - Overall Risk Score: 1

    - Obstacle ID: 357
    - Relative Direction: Left
    - Distance Risk Reason: DTClat is 2.52 m, which indicates the obstacle is moderately far away laterally; DTClong is 0.00 m. The obstacle has a consistent lateral separation from the ego vehicle.
    - Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 0
    - Lateral Distance Safety Score: 3
    - Overall Distance Safety Score: 3.0
    - Time Risk Reason: TTClat is inf, representing no lateral collision risk; TTClong is 0.00 s, indicating a collision has occurred or is about to occur longitudinally.
    - Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 0
    - Lateral Time Safety Score: 5
    - Overall Time Safety Score: 5.0
    - Overall Risk Score: 4

    - Obstacle ID: 360
    - Relative Direction: Rear-right
    - Distance Risk Reason: DTClong is -12.50m and DTClat is -0.27m, which indicate that this obstacle is behind and slightly to the right of the ego vehicle and quite close laterally. Recent timesteps show it moving closer laterally.
    - Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 5
    - Lateral Distance Safety Score: 1
    - Overall Distance Safety Score: 3.0
    - Time Risk Reason: TTClong is 2.56s, indicating low risk longitudinally; TTClat is 0.22s, which presents an extreme risk laterally. Over previous timesteps, TTClat has been rapidly decreasing, further escalating lateral collision risk.
    - Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 3
    - Lateral Time Safety Score: 1
    - Overall Time Safety Score: 2.0
    - Overall Risk Score: 3

    - Obstacle ID: 3104
    - Relative Direction: Front-right
    - Distance Risk Reason: The obstacle is far away both longitudinally (DTClong = 13.66m) and laterally (DTClat = -21.85m), indicating negligible risk. It has been consistently moving away laterally and its longitudinal distance remains large.
    - Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 5
    - Lateral Distance Safety Score: 5
    - Overall Distance Safety Score: 5.0
    - Time Risk Reason:  TTClong is 45.72s and TTClat is inf, indicating negligible risk in both directions. These values have been consistently high.
    - Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 5
    - Lateral Time Safety Score: 5
    - Overall Time Safety Score: 5.0
    - Overall Risk Score: 5


    - Obstacle ID: 3111
    - Relative Direction: Front-left
    - Distance Risk Reason: DTClong is 13.44 m and DTClat is 6.16 m. Both indicate the obstacle is at a safe distance currently but previous timesteps reveal a trend of the obstacle approaching the ego vehicle, suggesting the need to monitor this obstacle closely.
    - Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 5
    - Lateral Distance Safety Score: 5
    - Overall Distance Safety Score: 5.0
    - Time Risk Reason: TTClong is 1.16s and TTClat is 3.78s. TTClong suggests a high risk longitudinally while TTClat indicates a low lateral risk. The decreasing trend in TTClong over the past few timesteps requires attention as it suggests a growing longitudinal collision risk.
    - Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 2
    - Lateral Time Safety Score: 4
    - Overall Time Safety Score: 3.0
    - Overall Risk Score: 4
