Here's the collision risk analysis:

**Obstacle 30736:** This obstacle starts relatively far from the ego vehicle and in a different lanelet (1226).  Over time, it moves closer to the ego vehicle and eventually shares the same lanelet (59). While the distance decreases, the trajectories don't appear to intersect imminently, though the rate of closure towards the end of the provided timeframe warrants attention. Therefore, I classify this as a *High Risk* scenario.

**Obstacle 30737:** This obstacle remains in a different lanelet than the ego vehicle throughout the scenario and maintains a safe lateral distance. The trajectories suggest no immediate risk of collision. Thus, it poses a *Negligible Risk*.

**Obstacle 30738:** This obstacle is in a neighboring lane (59) and moves roughly parallel to the ego vehicle. The data doesn't indicate any lateral movement towards the ego vehicle's lane. Therefore, while proximity should be monitored, I assess the current risk as *Low*.

**Obstacle 30741:** This obstacle appears at t=1.0s and is located in a different lanelet (1146) far from the ego vehicle. Given the current data, it presents a *Negligible Risk*.
