Obstacle 30736: This obstacle starts relatively far from the ego vehicle and in a different lane (1226).  As time progresses, it moves closer to the ego vehicle and eventually shares the same lane (59). The distance decreases over time, and while the speeds are somewhat similar, obstacle 30736 shows fluctuating acceleration. This proximity and unpredictable acceleration warrants a high-risk assessment.

Obstacle 30737: This obstacle remains in a different lane throughout the scenario and maintains a safe distance from the ego vehicle. Its trajectory and velocity do not pose an immediate threat. Therefore, the risk is considered negligible.

Obstacle 30738: This obstacle shares the same lane (59) with the ego vehicle from the beginning and maintains a very close proximity.  Although the speeds are similar, the continuous close proximity raises concern for a potential collision.  This is classified as a high risk.

Obstacle 30741: This obstacle is consistently located in a different lane (1146 or 1225) and at a safe distance from the ego vehicle. Its trajectory poses no immediate threat. The risk is considered negligible.
