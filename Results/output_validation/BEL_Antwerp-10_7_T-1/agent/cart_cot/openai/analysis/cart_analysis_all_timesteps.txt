### Analysis:

At the 1.5-second mark, we assess the following obstacles:

1. **Obstacle 30736.0**:
   - **Trajectory Analysis**: It is moving in the same lane (59.0) as the ego vehicle and shows a consistent velocity of around 8.7 m/s, slightly decreasing at 1.5 seconds.
   - **Risk Assessment**: The relative velocity and position show it closing in on the ego's lane, but the distance is significant, resulting in manageable medium risk.

2. **Obstacle 30737.0**:
   - **Trajectory Analysis**: Although moving in a different lane (1225.0), its increasing velocity could potentially cause lane departure scenarios at some point.
   - **Risk Assessment**: As it's in a different lane with no immediate encroachment, the risk is low.

3. **Obstacle 30738.0**:
   - **Trajectory Analysis**: It's in the same lane (59.0) as the Ego with a modest increase in velocity, indicating maintaining a safe parallel trajectory.
   - **Risk Assessment**: Not considered an immediate threat due to parallel motion.

4. **Obstacle 30741.0**:
   - **Trajectory Analysis**: Positioned laterally away from the Ego vehicle, located in lane 1146.0 and moving parallel, rendering it distant from Ego's trajectory.
   - **Risk Assessment**: Low overall risk as there's no immediate trajectory intersection.

5. **Ego Vehicle (30742.0)**:
   - **Trajectory**: Steadily slowing down to 4.6652 m/s, with continuous slight orientation adjustments away from obstacles in the lateral view.

Based on both Time to Collision (TTC) and Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC), none of the obstacles create scenarios of immediate collision or extreme risk.

### JSON Output

```json
{
    "CollisionObstacles": [],
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {},
    "HighRiskObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "30736.0",
        "OverallRiskScore": 2
    }
}
```

This output indicates that there are no physically imminent collisions, but Obstacle 30736.0 presents the highest level of risk due to its relative velocity and proximity.
