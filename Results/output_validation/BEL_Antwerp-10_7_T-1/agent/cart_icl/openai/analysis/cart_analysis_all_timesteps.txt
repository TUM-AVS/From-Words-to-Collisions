To assess the potential collision risks, we will evaluate the motion of the ego vehicle and obstacles over the last timestep (1.5 seconds) with the earlier history as a trend check.

### Analysis Recap:
1. **Ego Vehicle**: 
   - Position: (-267.2821, 86.4495)
   - Orientation: -1.763176883552641 radians
   - Velocity: 4.6652 m/s
   - Acceleration: -1.4594 m/sÂ²

2. **Obstacle 30736**:
   - Position: (-268.4397, 80.1235)
   - Same lanelet (59.0) as the ego vehicle.
   - Velocity: 8.7799 m/s (faster than the ego, closing in)
   - Directly ahead, the high closing speed could result in a potential collision. Handles possibly at risk.

3. **Obstacle 30737**:
   - Position: (-279.1573, 64.2886)
   - Lanelet 1225.0 (different lane, currently no direct path).
   - Relative position significantly behind laterally, no immediate collision risk.

4. **Obstacle 30738**:
   - Position: (-259.5131, 101.1886)
   - In same lanelet 59.0, ahead of ego.
   - Moving slightly faster, at a safe distance to remain aware but not immediate high risk.

5. **Obstacle 30741**:
   - Position: (-267.416, 61.6413)
   - Lanelet 1146.0 (different lane).
   - Initially seems distant and not significant risk given big lateral separation and lane difference.

### Risk Assessment
- **Obstacle 30736**: Fast closing speed in the same lane, leading to potential collision if paths converge rapidly and no action is taken. High risk due to same lane and speed.

- **Obstacle 30738**: In the same lane as ego but positioned far enough ahead with small closing speed, requires monitoring but is not at immediate risk with current spacing and movement.

- **Obstacle 30741 and 30737**: Due to lane differences and current positions, these are negligible for immediate collision risk.

Let's compile this analysis into a structured JSON format:

```json
{
    "CollisionObstacles": [],
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "30736",
        "OverallRiskScore": 2
    },
    "HighRiskObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "30736",
        "OverallRiskScore": 2
    }
}
```

- **Obstacle 30736** is identified as having high risk primarily due to being in the same lane and closing rapidly into the path of the ego vehicle. Correspondingly, it is marked in the JSON under "ExtremeRiskObstacle".
