At t=1.5s, Obstacle 30736 is in front of the ego vehicle, at a longitudinal distance of 1.92m and practically zero lateral distance.  Given its longitudinal velocity of -13.29 m/s and its rapid approach, this obstacle poses an extreme risk of collision.

Obstacle 30737 is moving away from the ego vehicle both longitudinally and laterally, posing no immediate threat.

Obstacle 30738 is also moving away from the ego vehicle, and is located at the rear-left. Thus, this obstacle poses no immediate threat.

Obstacle 30741, while approaching longitudinally at -9.63 m/s, is still relatively far at 19.87m.  The lateral motion indicates it is moving towards the ego vehicle's path (-2.95 m/s lateral velocity), and although the distance is sufficient for reaction, the closing speed warrants attention. Therefore, this obstacle has a medium risk.



Risk Levels:
0: Collision - Physical contact occurred or unavoidable
1: Extreme Risk - Immediate collision likely
2: High Risk - Close to collision, needs quick action
3: Medium Risk - Manageable with proper reaction
4: Low Risk - Minimal risk, sufficient time to react
5: Negligible Risk - No significant risk
