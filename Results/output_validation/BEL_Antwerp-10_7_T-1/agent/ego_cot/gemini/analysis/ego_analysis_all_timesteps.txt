### Safety analysis for timestep 1.5s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

First, we need to clarify the missing "adjusted distance" values, crucial for accurate assessment.  Since they are not provided, I will make reasonable assumptions based on typical vehicle sizes and the given "real distances," acknowledging this introduces a degree of approximation.  I'll assume the adjusted longitudinal and lateral distances are slightly smaller than the real distances to account for vehicle size, particularly for near-collision situations.

**Assumptions for Adjusted Distances:**

* **Obstacle close to ego (under 5m):** Subtract approximately 0.5m from both longitudinal and lateral real distances.
* **Obstacle farther from ego (over 5m):** Use the real distance as an approximation for the adjusted distance.


### Obstacle Analysis:

**- Obstacle ID: 30736**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 30736 is in front and extremely close (1.92m real distance, estimated ~1.42m adjusted) to the ego vehicle.
- Distance safety score: 1 (Extreme Risk)
- Time Risk reason:  The closing longitudinal velocity is high (-13.29 m/s), indicating a very short time to collision if speeds are maintained.  The small positive lateral velocity suggests it might slightly sideswipe, but the dominant risk is head-on/front-near collision. Estimating TTC based on 1.42m and 13.29m/s gives ~0.1 seconds
- Time safety score: 1 (Extreme Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 1 (Extreme Risk)

**- Obstacle ID: 30737**
- Distance Risk reason: Located far from the ego vehicle (19.51 m).
- Distance safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- Time Risk reason:  Moving away from the ego vehicle longitudinally (2.99 m/s) and laterally (-1.69 m/s).
- Time safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 5 (Negligible Risk)

**- Obstacle ID: 30738**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 30738 is well behind the ego vehicle (-11.44 m).
- Distance safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- Time Risk reason: Moving further away.
- Time safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 5 (Negligible Risk)


**- Obstacle ID: 30741**
- Distance Risk reason:  Relatively far from the ego vehicle (19.87m).
- Distance safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- Time Risk reason: Approaching longitudinally at moderate speed (-9.63 m/s) and laterally (-2.95 m/s), however lateral motion increases lateral distance which reduces the collision possibility
- Time safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 4 (Low Risk)
