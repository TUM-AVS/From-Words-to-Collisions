At t=1.5s:

* **Obstacle 30736:** Front, longitudinal 1.92m, lateral 0.00m.  Velocity: longitudinal -13.29 m/s, lateral 1.65 m/s.

This obstacle is directly in front of the ego vehicle and rapidly approaching. The lateral distance is 0.00m, indicating perfect alignment in the lane. While the longitudinal distance is still 1.92m, the high closing velocity (-13.29 m/s) points to an *extremely high risk* of imminent collision.

*TTC (longitudinal): 1.92m / 13.29m/s = 0.14s*
*MDC ≈ 1.92m (using longitudinal distance as the primary concern)*
*Risk Score: 1 (Extreme Risk due to very low TTC)*

* **Obstacle 30737:** Front-right, longitudinal 19.51m, lateral -5.81m. Velocity: longitudinal 2.99 m/s, lateral -1.69 m/s.

This obstacle is moving further away longitudinally which drastically reduces risk. The lateral movement is also diverging.

*TTC (longitudinal): Not applicable due to diverging velocity
TTC(Lateral): Not applicable due to diverging velocity*

*MDC ≈ 5.81m*
*Risk Score: 4 (Low risk)*


* **Obstacle 30738:** Rear-left, longitudinal -11.44m, lateral 3.20m. Velocity: longitudinal -12.08 m/s, lateral 1.59 m/s.

This obstacle is behind and to the left of the ego vehicle and moving further away longitudinally.  The lateral distance is stable but overall risk is low given the trajectory.

*TTC (longitudinal): Not applicable due to diverging velocity
TTC (lateral): 3.20m/1.59m/s = 2.01s*

*MDC ≈ 3.20m*

*Risk Score: 3 (Medium Risk)*

* **Obstacle 30741:** Front-left, longitudinal 19.87m, lateral 3.00m. Velocity: longitudinal -9.63 m/s, lateral -2.95 m/s.

This obstacle is somewhat far ahead and to the left, but approaching longitudinally. The lateral velocity shows divergence, moving away from the ego vehicle.

*TTC (longitudinal): 19.87m / 9.63m/s = 2.06s
TTC (lateral): Not applicable due to diverging velocity*

*MDC ≈ 3.00m*
*Risk Score: 3 (Medium Risk)*
