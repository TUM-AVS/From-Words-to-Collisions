### Obstacle-by-Obstacle Analysis:

#### Obstacle 30736:
- **Current Position (at 1.5 seconds):** Longitudinal distance = 1.92 m, Lateral distance = 0.00 m
- **Relative Motion:** Moving toward the ego car longitudinally.
- **Relative Velocity:** Longitudinal = -13.29 m/s, Lateral = 1.65 m/s
- **TTC Calculation:**
  - Longitudinal: Since the velocity is -13.29 m/s, TTC = 1.92 m / 13.29 m/s = 0.144 s (Approx.)
  - Lateral: The lateral distance is 0.00 m, indicating a same-lane alignment.
- **MDC Calculation:** Given the relative alignment, the minimum distance to collision is practically zero since both dimensions are aligned with the ego path and a rapid closing velocity.
- **Risk Assessment:** With the longitudinal TTC being very low and MDC effectively zero, there is a current collision occurring.
  - **Assigned Risk Score:** 0 (Collision)

#### Obstacle 30737:
- **Current Position (at 1.5 seconds):** Longitudinal distance = 19.51 m, Lateral distance = -5.81 m
- **Relative Motion:** Moving away longitudinally and laterally.
- **Relative Velocity:** Longitudinal = 2.99 m/s, Lateral = -1.69 m/s
- **TTC Calculation:**
  - Not applicable because the relative trajectories indicate the obstacle is moving away.
- **MDC Calculation:** The high relative distances and moving-away velocity indicate no projection of intersection.
- **Risk Assessment:** Given the increasing distance trajectory, this obstacle poses negligible risk.
  - **Assigned Risk Score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)

#### Obstacle 30738:
- **Current Position (at 1.5 seconds):** Longitudinal distance = -11.44 m, Lateral distance = 3.20 m
- **Relative Motion:** Moving away longitudinally and laterally.
- **Relative Velocity:** Longitudinal = -12.08 m/s, Lateral = 1.59 m/s
- **TTC and MDC Calculation:** The negative longitudinal distance (behind the ego) and moving away trajectory show no collision course.
- **Risk Assessment:** While in a different lane and moving away, this obstacle has negligible risk.
  - **Assigned Risk Score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)

#### Obstacle 30741:
- **Current Position (at 1.5 seconds):** Longitudinal distance = 19.87 m, Lateral distance = 3.00 m
- **Relative Motion:** Moving toward the ego car longitudinally and laterally.
- **Relative Velocity:** Longitudinal = -9.63 m/s, Lateral = -2.95 m/s
- **TTC Calculation:**
  - Longitudinal: 19.87 m / 9.63 m/s = ~2.06 seconds
  - Lateral: 3.00 m / 2.95 m/s = ~1.02 seconds
- **MDC Calculation:** The trajectories cross but generally with enough time to maneuver.
- **Risk Assessment:** While the lateral component reduces risk significantly, the longitudinal speed suggests a medium risk.
  - **Assigned Risk Score:** 3 (Medium Risk)

### Conclusion:
Obstacle 30736 is in collision with the ego vehicle due to its aligned path and fast closing velocity, indicating immediate physical contact, thus receiving a risk score of 0. Obstacle 30741 presents the next highest risk of collision with a score of 3 due to its closing trajectory towards the ego vehicle, while obstacles 30737 and 30738 pose no significant risk at this time.
