At t=1.7s, Ego is in lanelet 59 with a velocity of 3.93 m/s and decelerating at -2.11 m/s².  Let's analyze the latest positions of the obstacles relative to Ego:

* **Obstacle 30736:** Located in the same lanelet (59) as Ego, at (-267.77, 81.75), moving at 8.79 m/s while decelerating slightly (-0.61 m/s²).  Given the relatively close proximity and higher velocity of the obstacle, an immediate collision is not certain, but extremely likely if both vehicles maintain their current trajectories and decelerations. This poses an *Extreme Risk*.

* **Obstacle 30737:**  Located in lanelet 55 at (-279.78, 62.85), moving at 7.84 m/s and decelerating significantly (-1.34 m/s²).  Given its current position and lanelet, this obstacle does not present an immediate collision risk with Ego.

* **Obstacle 30738:** Located in the same lanelet (59) as Ego, at (-258.92, 102.58) with a velocity of 7.59 m/s.  The obstacle's longitudinal position is further ahead of the ego vehicle and it's not an immediate risk at this point.

* **Obstacle 30739:** In lanelet 379 at (-251.30, 60.60), moving at 7.48 m/s. Currently poses no risk to Ego due to lateral separation.

* **Obstacle 30741:** Located in lanelet 430 at (-267.90, 62.70) moving at 6.14 m/s. Not a risk to Ego due to position and lanelet.

    "IsCollisionScenario": false,
    "Reasoning": "Obstacle 30736 poses an extreme risk of collision with Ego due to close proximity and higher velocity in the same lanelet (59).  While not an immediate collision, the current trajectories and decelerations make a collision very likely if no evasive action is taken."
