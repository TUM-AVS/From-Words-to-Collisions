At t=1.7s, Ego is in lanelet 59 with a velocity of 3.93 m/s and decelerating at -2.11 m/sÂ².

* **Obstacle 30736:** Located in lanelet 59, same as Ego.  Position (-267.77, 81.75) is close to Ego's (-267.49, 85.54). Both are moving in roughly the same direction (orientations 1.18 and -1.82 respectively, suggesting a likely lane change by Ego or obstacle), and obstacle 30736's velocity (8.79 m/s) is considerably higher than Ego's while Ego is braking hard. This creates a high risk of rear-ending. Risk score: 1 (Extreme Risk).

* **Obstacle 30738:** Also in lanelet 59. Position (-258.92, 102.58) is somewhat further ahead of Ego and moving at a similar speed (7.59 m/s) but again in the same direction. This poses less immediate risk than 30736 but requires attention. Risk score: 2 (High Risk) - therefore not included in JSON.

* **Obstacle 30737:** Now in lanelet 55 and appears to be moving away from Ego.  No immediate risk. Risk score: 4 (Low Risk) - therefore not included in JSON.

* **Obstacle 30739:** Located in lanelet 379.  Too far away to pose any immediate risk. Risk score: 5 (Negligible Risk) - therefore not included in JSON.

* **Obstacle 30741:** Located in lanelet 430.  Too far to present any immediate risk. Risk score: 5 (Negligible Risk) - therefore not included in JSON.

        "IsCollisionScenario": false,
        "Reasoning": "Obstacle 30736 poses an extreme risk due to its proximity, higher speed, and Ego's rapid deceleration in the same lanelet (59). While no collision is imminent, the rapid closure rate and deceleration differences suggest an immediate collision is very likely without intervention."
