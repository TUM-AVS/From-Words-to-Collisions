### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. **Lanelet Analysis**: Ego is in lanelet 59.0. Only obstacles 30736.0 and 30738.0 are in the same lanelet, but both are moving away.
2. **Trajectory Analysis**: No obstacles show a converging trajectory with ego over the 10 timesteps.
3. **Velocity Analysis**: All obstacles have higher velocities than ego and are moving away.
4. **Distance Analysis**: No obstacles are within a critical distance of ego.
5. **Conclusion**: No collision or extreme risk scenarios detected.
