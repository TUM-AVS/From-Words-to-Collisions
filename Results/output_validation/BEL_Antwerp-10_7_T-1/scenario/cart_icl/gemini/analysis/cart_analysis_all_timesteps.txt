### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 30736.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 30736.0 is in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle and rapidly approaching from behind. The distance is decreasing over time.
- Distance safety score: 2
- Time Risk reason:  Given the current velocities and accelerations, a collision is likely within the next few seconds if no action is taken.
- Time safety score: 2
- Overall Risk score: 2

- Obstacle ID: 30737.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 30737.0 is in a different lanelet and moving away from the ego vehicle.  No immediate risk.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: The trajectories diverge, indicating no time-based risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 30738.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 30738.0 is in the same lanelet and ahead of the ego vehicle, but the distance is increasing.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: The relative velocities suggest the distance will continue to increase, posing no immediate threat.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- Obstacle ID: 30739.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 30739.0 is in a different lanelet and relatively far from the ego vehicle.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason:  No immediate time-based risk due to the distance and different lanelets.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 30741.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 30741.0 is in a different lanelet and poses no immediate distance-based risk.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: No immediate time-based risk due to separate lanelets and current trajectories.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5


### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
This is not a collision scenario at the current timestep, but there is a high risk of collision with Obstacle 30736.0 in the near future given its current trajectory and rapidly decreasing distance to the ego vehicle.
