### Obstacle Analysis:

#### Obstacle ID: 30736
- **Distance Risk Reason**: The obstacle 30736 is in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle at the most recent timestep, and the distance between them is decreasing. Their trajectories indicate a converging path.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 2
- **Time Risk Reason**: The obstacle has maintained a higher velocity than the ego vehicle, suggesting quick conjunction. Their relative velocities over time indicate a potential near-term collision.
- **Time Safety Score**: 2
- **Overall Risk Score**: 2

#### Obstacle ID: 30737
- **Distance Risk Reason**: The obstacle is distant and moving along a different path. Although there has been proximity reduction due to paths intersecting, current distances provide room for maneuvering.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 4
- **Time Risk Reason**: The obstacle moves with consistent velocity, showing no significant directional changes towards the ego vehicle.
- **Time Safety Score**: 4
- **Overall Risk Score**: 4

#### Obstacle ID: 30738
- **Distance Risk Reason**: Positioned in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle with minor fluctuations, but with increasing speed, suggesting it could pass without interference.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 3
- **Time Risk Reason**: The trajectory is somewhat parallel, maintaining similar velocities. The minor accelerating trend does not favor immediate collision.
- **Time Safety Score**: 3
- **Overall Risk Score**: 3

#### Obstacle ID: 30741
- **Distance Risk Reason**: Located in a different lanelet and well below the trajectory path of the ego, with significant distance maintained over the last measurements.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 5
- **Time Risk Reason**: Velocity trends and orientation show stable movement avoiding direct interception with the ego vehicle.
- **Time Safety Score**: 5
- **Overall Risk Score**: 5

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. **Identify Key Factors**: Only obstacle 30736 shares the lanelet with the ego in the most recent timestep, indicating potential risk due to closeness in relative position and speed. 
2. **Evaluate Historical Trajectories**: Assessments show decreasing distance between ego and obstacle 30736, requiring attention. Others maintain safe trajectories.
3. **Final Decision**: While no direct collision seems imminent, obstacle 30736 poses a high risk requiring quick decisions to avoid future complications.
