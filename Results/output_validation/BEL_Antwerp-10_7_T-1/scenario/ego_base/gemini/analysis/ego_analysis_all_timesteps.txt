Obstacle 30736 collided with the ego vehicle at time 1.7s. Obstacles 30739 and 30741 are approaching the ego vehicle from the front-left. Obstacle 30739's lateral velocity indicates it is moving towards the ego vehicle at -7.36 m/s and its longitudinal distance is 15.67m. Obstacle 30741 is also moving towards the ego vehicle laterally at -3.97m/s and has a longitudinal distance of 17.73m. Although these obstacles present a potential risk in future timesteps, they are not currently an extreme risk at time 1.7s. Obstacle 30737 and 30738 are moving away from the ego vehicle and pose no immediate risk.

**Risk Levels and Definitions:**
<Collision (Score: 0)>: Actual collision has occurred or is unavoidable within the next timestep.
<Extreme Risk (Score: 1)>: Immediate collision or very high likelihood of impact. Urgent action is required.
<High Risk (Score: 2)>: Close to collision or highly probable collision path. Needs prompt attention and quick manoeuvring.
<Medium Risk (Score: 3)>: Moderate collision risk but manageable with timely reactions and proper strategies.
<Low Risk (Score: 4)>: Minimal collision risk. The situation is controllable with sufficient time to react.
<Negligible Risk (Score: 5)>: No significant collision risk. Obstacles are either moving away or far enough not to interfere.
