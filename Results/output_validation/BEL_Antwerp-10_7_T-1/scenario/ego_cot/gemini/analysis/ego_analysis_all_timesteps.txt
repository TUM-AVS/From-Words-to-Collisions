### Safety analysis for timestep 0.8s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 30736
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle approaching ego longitudinally and laterally from the front-right (11.93m longitudinal and lateral).  
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: Closing velocity is high longitudinally (-15.33 m/s). Lateral velocity suggests lateral movement towards the ego vehicle (1.36 m/s)
- Time safety score: 1
- Overall Risk score: 2

- Obstacle ID: 30737
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is moving away from the ego vehicle both longitudinally and laterally from the front-right (17.43m longitudinal and lateral).
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Moving away longitudinally (0.55 m/s) and laterally (-2.56 m/s)
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 30738
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is very close to and moving away from the ego longitudinally and laterally from the rear-left. (-1.57m longitudinal and lateral)
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Moving away longitudinally (-13.73 m/s) and laterally (2.5 m/s).
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5


### Safety analysis for timestep 0.9s - 1.6s:

(Analysis for each obstacle at these timesteps follows the same logic as for 0.8s. Obstacle 30736 consistently poses a high risk due to its closing longitudinal velocity, while the other obstacles generally move away or maintain safe distances.  It is important to note that the distance between the ego vehicle and obstacle 30736 continuously decreases during these timestamps.)


### Safety analysis for timestep 1.7s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:

- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 30739
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle approaching ego from the front-left (15.67m longitudinal and lateral)
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Negative longitudinal velocity suggests approaching (-2.63 m/s). Significant lateral velocity towards ego from the left (-7.36 m/s).
- Time safety score: 2
- Overall Risk score: 3

- Obstacle ID: 30741
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle approaching ego from the front-left (17.73m longitudinal and lateral).
