### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 30736
- Relative Direction: Front
- Distance Risk Reason:  DTClong is 0.0m indicating a collision. The obstacle has been approaching the ego vehicle longitudinally over the past several timesteps, resulting in a collision at this timestep. Lateral distance is not a factor as the relative direction is Front and wdominant is 1.
- Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 0
- Lateral Distance Safety Score: 0
- Overall Distance Safety Score: 0.0
- Time Risk Reason: TTClong is 0.0s indicating a collision. The obstacle has been approaching the ego vehicle, and the TTC has steadily decreased over previous timesteps, culminating in a collision at this timestep.
- Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 0
- Lateral Time Safety Score: 0
- Overall Time Safety Score: 0.0
- Overall Risk Score: 0

- Obstacle ID: 30737
- Relative Direction: Front-right
- Distance Risk Reason: DTClong is 20.51m and DTClat is -4.72m. Both are greater than 5, indicating negligible risk. This obstacle has consistently moved away from the ego vehicle both longitudinally and laterally.
- Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 5
- Lateral Distance Safety Score: 5
- Overall Distance Safety Score: 5.0
- Time Risk Reason:  Both TTClong and TTClat are inf, indicating no risk of collision in the foreseeable future. This aligns with the observed trajectory of the obstacle moving away from the ego vehicle.
- Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 5
- Lateral Time Safety Score: 5
- Overall Time Safety Score: 5.0
- Overall Risk Score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 30738
- Relative Direction: Rear-left
- Distance Risk Reason: DTClong is -14.12m and DTClat is 2.50m. While the lateral distance is relatively small, the longitudinal distance is large and negative, meaning the obstacle is significantly behind the ego vehicle.  The obstacle has been moving away longitudinally and the lateral distance has minimal impact.
- Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 5
- Lateral Distance Safety Score: 4
- Overall Distance Safety Score: 4.5
- Time Risk Reason: Both TTClong and TTClat are inf, indicating no time-based risk, and the past trajectory confirms the obstacle is moving away.
- Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 5
- Lateral Time Safety Score: 5
- Overall Time Safety Score: 5.0
- Overall Risk Score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 30739
- Relative Direction: Front-left
- Distance Risk Reason: DTClong is 15.67m and DTClat is 20.23m.  Both are well outside the collision range. The trajectory of the obstacle doesn't indicate an immediate risk.
- Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 5
- Lateral Distance Safety Score: 5
- Overall Distance Safety Score: 5.0
- Time Risk Reason: TTClong is 5.96s and TTClat is 2.75s. The TTC values indicate low risk. While the obstacle is approaching, it would take significant time before a potential collision.
- Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 5
- Lateral Time Safety Score: 4
- Overall Time Safety Score: 4.5
- Overall Risk Score: 5


- Obstacle ID: 30741
- Relative Direction: Front-left
- Distance Risk Reason: DTClong is 17.73m and DTClat is 3.62m. Though DTClat is within the 5m range, DTClong is significantly large, indicating a negligible distance-based risk in the immediate future.
- Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 5
- Lateral Distance Safety Score: 4
- Overall Distance Safety Score: 4.5
- Time Risk Reason: TTClong is 2.06s and TTClat is 0.91s. TTClat is high risk since it is closing to collision.
- Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 3
- Lateral Time Safety Score: 2
- Overall Time Safety Score: 2.5
- Overall Risk Score: 4
