Here's the collision risk analysis:

**Ego Vehicle (30670):** The ego vehicle is decelerating within its lane (120).  We need to focus on obstacles also in lane 120 or those whose trajectories might intersect with the ego vehicle's path.

**Obstacle 30671:**  Stationary. Located in lanelet 119. Poses no immediate risk but its stationary nature should be monitored. Risk score: 5.

**Obstacle 30673:** Moving at a significant velocity in lanelet 131.  Not an immediate risk, but monitor. Risk score: 4.

**Obstacle 30674:** Initially in lanelet 1332, this obstacle moves into the ego vehicle's lane (120).  Crucially, at t=6.7s and t=6.8s, its x-coordinate gets very close to the ego vehicle while both are in lane 120 and the ego vehicle is slowing down.  This represents a high risk of collision. By t=6.9s and t=7.1s, the distances widen again but given the proximity around t=6.7/6.8s, this remains an obstacle to be monitored. Risk Score: 2 initially, escalating to 1 during the period of close proximity, then 2-3 as it moves away. Predicted risk: 3.

**Obstacle 30675:**  Moving in lanelet 1332 and then transitions to lanelet 1331; poses no risk. Risk score: 5.

**Obstacle 30676:** Almost stationary in lanelet 119.  Poses no immediate risk. Risk score: 5.

**Obstacle 30677:**  Moving slowly in lanelet 119. No immediate risk. Risk score: 5.

**Obstacle 30678:** Moving slowly in lanelet 119. No immediate risk. Risk score: 5.

**Obstacle 30680:**  Moving in lanelet 119. No immediate risk. Risk score: 5.
