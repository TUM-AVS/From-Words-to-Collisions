Obstacle 30671: Stationary and not a collision risk. Risk score 5.
Obstacle 30673: Moving away from the ego vehicle. No immediate risk, but monitor. Risk score 4.
Obstacle 30674: Initially far but its trajectory brings it close to the ego vehicle, sharing the same lanelet (120) with the ego vehicle. High risk of collision given its high speed and decreasing distance towards the ego vehicle within the timeframe, as evidenced by the coordinates over time. Risk score 2.
Obstacle 30675: Although initially close and moving fast, it's in a different lanelet (1332/1331) and its trajectory doesn't appear to intersect with the ego vehicle's. Risk score 4.
Obstacle 30676, 30677, 30678, 30680:  These obstacles are in a different lanelet (119) and maintain a safe distance from the ego vehicle. Risk score 5.
