In the given scenario, the focus should be on analyzing the likelihood and imminence of a collision between the ego vehicle and the obstacles at the most recent timestep (at 7.1 seconds). Here, we assess each obstacle's trajectory, position, velocity, and relative motion compared to the ego vehicle. We pay particular attention to Time to Collision (TTC) and Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC) to support our evaluation of risk levels.

### Brief Analysis for Risky Obstacles

1. **Ego Vehicle (ID: 30670.0):**
   - At the final timestep, the ego vehicle is moving very slowly (0.3685 m/s) and has a trajectory decreasing in speed.
   - Positioned at (-306.9202, -224.8144)

2. **Obstacle 30671.0:**
   - Stationary with zero velocity and acceleration.
   - Positioned at (-298.4398, -221.1483)
   - Located in the adjacent lanelet with no immediate risk of collision to the ego vehicle.

3. **Obstacle 30674.0:**
   - Positioned at (-302.8692, -220.7428) and in the same lanelet as the ego.
   - Maintaining a relatively high velocity (7.8321 m/s) toward the same direction of motion.
   - Due to reduced separation and speed differential, it might require urgent attention.
   - **Overall Risk Score:** 2

4. **Obstacle 30675.0:**
   - Positioned at (-291.0953, -211.0226), moving fast (8.5513 m/s) but outside the direct path of the ego vehicle.
   - Located in different lanelets, reducing immediate collision risk.

5. **Obstacles 30676.0 through 30680.0:**
   - All have very low velocities and small acceleration, mostly stationary or very slow heading towards separation from the ego.
   - No significant risk as they are further away or in separate lanelets from the ego vehicle.

Considering the provided scenario and movement characteristics of obstacles in the most recent timestep, the greatest concern is obstacle 30674.0 due to its velocity and position relative to the ego vehicle.
