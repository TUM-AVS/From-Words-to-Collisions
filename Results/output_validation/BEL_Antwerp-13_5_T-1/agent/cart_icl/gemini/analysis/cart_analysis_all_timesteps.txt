Obstacle 30674 is showing high risk as it is in the same lane as the ego vehicle and rapidly approaching. The velocity is high, and the distance is decreasing across timesteps. This obstacle requires close monitoring due to the potential for a collision.

Obstacle 30675 is consistently in a different lanelet and maintains a safe lateral distance from the ego vehicle. While its longitudinal velocity is high, the trajectory doesn't pose an immediate threat.

Obstacle 30671, 30676, 30677, 30678, and 30680 are all located in lanelet 119, different from the ego vehicle's lanelet 120. They are all at a safe distance and the relative velocities and trajectories do not suggest any immediate danger.
