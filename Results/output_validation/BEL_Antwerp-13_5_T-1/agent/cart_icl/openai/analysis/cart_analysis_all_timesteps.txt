Upon analyzing the provided scenario:

### 1. Analysis at 7.1 seconds:

- **Ego Vehicle:**
  - Position: (-306.9202, -224.8144)
  - Velocity: 0.3685 m/s (slowing down)
  - Lanelet: 120.0

- **Obstacle 30671.0:**
  - Stationary at (-298.4398, -221.1483)
  - In Lanelet 119.0
  - Not in the same direction or close proximity to the Ego, hence **Low Risk (4).**

- **Obstacle 30674.0:**
  - Moving in the same lanelet (120.0) as Ego: 
  - Position: (-302.8692, -220.7428)
  - Velocity: 7.8321 m/s
  - Closing the gap with Ego, yet the lateral position is different, implying no immediate collision risk.
  - Risk: **Medium (3)** if not changing lane.

- **Obstacle 30675.0:**
  - Position: (-291.0953, -211.0226), Lanelet 1331.0
  - Velocity: 8.5513 m/s
  - Not in the direct path of Ego currently, though it could close in fast on its current lanelet.
  - Risk: **Medium (3)**

- **Obstacle 30676.0:**
  - Stationary with position close to the Ego (-303.6899, -226.5097), but not in direct collision path.
  - Risk: **Low (4)**

- **Obstacle 30677.0:**
  - Position (-314.0957, -237.6169)
  - Not directly in the path and lower velocity, within nearby lanelet 119.0
  - Risk: **Low (4)**

- **Obstacle 30678.0:**
  - Near stationary movements, located at (-308.932, -231.9196)
  - Risk: **Low (4)**

- **Obstacle 30680.0:**
  - Position: (-319.3133, -243.997)
  - Velocity: 0.7168 m/s
  - Not in the same lane or direct collision path with Ego.
  - Risk: **Low (4)**

Overall, no current **Collision (0)** or **Extreme Risk (1)** scenarios were identified, mainly due to significant lateral separations and varied lanelets.
