At timestamp 7.1 seconds, the following obstacles present varying levels of risk:

* **Obstacle 30671:** Located rear-left and moving away from the ego vehicle. This poses a negligible risk. (Risk score: 5)
* **Obstacle 30673:** No longer present in the latest timestamp. It was moving away from the ego vehicle. (Risk score: 5)
* **Obstacle 30674:** Located behind the ego vehicle at -1.24m longitudinally and closing fast (7.46 m/s).  Given the low longitudinal distance and relative velocity, TTC is very low, representing a very high risk of collision. (Risk score: 1)
* **Obstacle 30675:** Located rear-left, but lateral distance is now minimal (0.05m) while still approaching longitudinally (4.87 m/s) and laterally (-6.76 m/s). This obstacle is on a collision course with the ego vehicle, presenting an extreme risk. (Risk score: 1)
* **Obstacle 30676:** Located to the left (1.88m) and slowly moving away laterally.  Lateral distance is sufficient and there is no longitudinal relative motion. Low risk. (Risk score: 4)
* **Obstacle 30677:** Located front-left, maintaining a safe distance and low closing velocity.  Negligible risk. (Risk score: 5)
* **Obstacle 30678:** Located front-left at 1.98m longitudinally, with a low relative velocity of -0.40 m/s. Represents a medium risk due to proximity. (Risk score: 3)
* **Obstacle 30680:** Located far front-left, minimal risk. (Risk score: 5)
