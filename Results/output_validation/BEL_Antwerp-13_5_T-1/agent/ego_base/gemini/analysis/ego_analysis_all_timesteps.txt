At 7.1 seconds, the following obstacles are present:

* **Obstacle 30671 (Rear-left):**  Moving away longitudinally at -0.37 m/s and no lateral movement. Poses no immediate threat. Risk score: 5 (Negligible Risk)

* **Obstacle 30674 (Behind):**  Approaching rapidly from behind at 7.46 m/s with a longitudinal distance of -1.24 m. This obstacle represents an extreme risk of collision in the next few moments. Risk score: 1 (Extreme Risk)

* **Obstacle 30675 (Rear-left):**  Approaching from behind and the left at 4.87 m/s longitudinally and -6.76 m/s laterally. Though the longitudinal distance is -16.42 m, its lateral motion brings it closer, warranting attention. Risk score: 3 (Medium Risk)

* **Obstacle 30676 (Left):**  Laterally close at 1.88 m, moving slowly away at -0.37 m/s longitudinally, no lateral movement.  Not an immediate risk but needs monitoring. Risk score: 4 (Low Risk).

* **Obstacle 30677 (Front-left):** At a safe distance longitudinally (9.66 m) and laterally (2.22 m), moving slowly towards the ego vehicle. Risk score: 4 (Low Risk)

* **Obstacle 30678 (Front-left):**  Very close longitudinally at 1.98m, moving slowly towards the ego vehicle at -0.40 m/s longitudinally. Laterally close at 1.92 m, and no lateral movement. This represents a high risk of collision. Risk score: 2 (High Risk)

* **Obstacle 30680 (Front-left):** At a safe distance longitudinally (17.87 m) and laterally (2.95 m), moving slowly towards the ego vehicle. Risk score: 4 (Low Risk)


Risk Levels:
0: Collision - Physical contact occurred or unavoidable
1: Extreme Risk - Immediate collision likely
2: High Risk - Close to collision, needs quick action
3: Medium Risk - Manageable with proper reaction
4: Low Risk - Minimal risk, sufficient time to react
5: Negligible Risk - No significant risk
