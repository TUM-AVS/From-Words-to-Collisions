### Safety analysis for timestep 7.1s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

**Assumptions and Calculations:**

Since the provided scenario context lacks ego vehicle dimensions and doesn't offer adjusted distances (adjusted_d_long and adjusted_d_lat) as requested in the instructions,  I will use the provided real distances (DTClong and DTClat) and make assumptions about TTC calculations as longitudinal and lateral TTC calculations are not readily available with the given data. I assume that constant velocity and constant acceleration formulas (s = ut + 0.5 * at^2) can be used to estimate a Time-to-Collision (TTC) using available velocity and acceleration values from a singular timestep snapshot. However, this should be regarded as a rough estimate due to the lack of data across multiple timesteps.

**TTC and MDC Estimation:**

Given the limitations of the data, a simplified approach for TTC and MDC estimation will be applied, focusing on proximity and closing velocities at the last timestep (7.1s). For obstacles with closing velocities, a simplified calculation assuming constant velocity will be performed when feasible. This can provide a rough estimate to aid risk scoring.  However, without consistent relative velocities and accelerations data across timesteps, the calculations are prone to considerable error.  It is imperative to have data from several timesteps to reliably calculate TTC and MDC.

**Further Note:** The relative positions of the obstacles (Front-left, Rear-left, etc.) and their motion descriptions play a vital role in assessing risk.  For example, an obstacle approaching from behind with a positive closing velocity represents a higher risk than an obstacle moving away at the same speed.
