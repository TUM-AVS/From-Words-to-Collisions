Let me analyze each obstacle at the most recent timestep (7.1 seconds) and assess collision risks:

1. Obstacle 30671 (Rear-left):
   - Distance: longitudinal -4.04m (moving away), lateral 1.89m (stable)
   - Velocity: longitudinal -0.37m/s (moving away), lateral 0.00m/s
   - MDC: 1.89m (lateral) - Medium Risk (3)
   - TTC: N/A (moving away in both dimensions)
   - Overall Risk: 5 (Negligible)

2. Obstacle 30674 (Behind):
   - Distance: longitudinal -1.24m (closing fast), lateral 0.00m (aligned)
   - Velocity: longitudinal 7.46m/s (closing fast), lateral -0.15m/s
   - MDC: 1.24m - High Risk (2)
   - TTC: 1.24/7.46 = 0.17s - Extreme Risk (1)
   - Overall Risk: 1 (Extreme Risk)

3. Obstacle 30675 (Rear-left):
   - Distance: longitudinal -16.42m, lateral 0.05m (very close alignment)
   - Velocity: longitudinal 4.87m/s, lateral -6.76m/s (closing fast laterally)
   - MDC: 0.05m - Extreme Risk (1)
   - TTC (lateral): 0.05/6.76 = 0.007s - Collision Risk (0)
   - Overall Risk: 0 (Collision)

4. Obstacle 30676 (Left):
   - Distance: longitudinal 0.00m (aligned), lateral 1.88m
   - Velocity: longitudinal -0.37m/s (moving away), lateral 0.00m/s
   - MDC: 1.88m - Medium Risk (3)
   - TTC: N/A
   - Overall Risk: 5 (Negligible)

5. Obstacle 30677 (Front-left):
   - Distance: longitudinal 9.66m, lateral 2.22m
   - Velocity: longitudinal -0.57m/s (moving away), lateral -0.01m/s
   - MDC: 2.22m - Medium Risk (3)
   - TTC: N/A
   - Overall Risk: 5 (Negligible)

6. Obstacle 30678 (Front-left):
   - Distance: longitudinal 1.98m, lateral 1.92m
   - Velocity: longitudinal -0.40m/s (moving away), lateral -0.00m/s
   - MDC: 1.92m - Medium Risk (3)
   - TTC: N/A
   - Overall Risk: 5 (Negligible)

7. Obstacle 30680 (Front-left):
   - Distance: longitudinal 17.87m, lateral 2.95m
   - Velocity: longitudinal -1.08m/s (moving away), lateral -0.08m/s
   - MDC: 2.95m - Medium Risk (3)
   - TTC: N/A
   - Overall Risk: 5 (Negligible)

Key Findings:
- Obstacle 30675 shows imminent collision risk (lateral distance 0.05m with high closing speed)
- Obstacle 30674 shows extreme risk from behind (very short TTC)
- Other obstacles pose minimal or no immediate risk
