* **Obstacle 30671 (Rear-Left):**  This obstacle is moving away from the ego vehicle both longitudinally (-4.04m) and laterally (1.89m).  There is no risk of collision. Risk Level: 5 (Negligible Risk)

* **Obstacle 30674 (Behind):** This obstacle is approaching the ego vehicle rapidly from behind. The longitudinal distance is decreasing across timesteps and is now very close (-1.24m). While the lateral distance is 0.00m, indicating alignment in the same lane, the rapidly closing longitudinal distance and high relative longitudinal velocity (7.46 m/s) pose an extreme risk. TTC = 1.24m / 7.46m/s = 0.17s.  Risk Level: 1 (Extreme Risk)

* **Obstacle 30675 (Rear-Left):** Although initially further away, this obstacle has been consistently approaching the ego vehicle from the rear-left.  The longitudinal distance is -16.42m and the lateral distance is now very small (0.05m).  The closing lateral velocity (-6.76 m/s) is significant. Though the longitudinal distance suggests some time before a potential collision, the lateral distance is so small that the vehicle will cut in very soon and very close in front of the ego car, resulting in an extreme risk. Risk Level: 1 (Extreme Risk)

* **Obstacle 30676 (Left):** This obstacle is at a lateral distance of 1.88m, almost side by side. The longitudinal distance is 0.00m indicating perfect alignment. The relative lateral velocity is very small but approaching (0.00 m/s), so we consider the lateral distance itself. With the car to the left so close and converging, there is a high risk. Risk Level: 2 (High Risk)

* **Obstacle 30677 (Front-Left):**  This obstacle is at a safe longitudinal distance (9.66m) and moderate lateral distance (2.22m).  It is moving slightly towards the ego vehicle longitudinally (-0.57 m/s) and laterally (-0.01 m/s). This obstacle poses a low risk. Risk Level: 4 (Low Risk)

* **Obstacle 30678 (Front-Left):** This obstacle is very close to the ego vehicle, both longitudinally (1.98m) and laterally (1.92m). Although the velocities are not extremely high, the proximity itself represents a high risk. Risk Level: 2 (High Risk)

* **Obstacle 30680 (Front-Left):** This obstacle is at a safe distance longitudinally (17.87m) and laterally (2.95m). Its motion indicates it's approaching but poses no immediate threat. Risk Level: 4 (Low Risk)
