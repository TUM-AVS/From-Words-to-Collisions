### Obstacle-by-Obstacle Analysis:

#### Obstacle 30671:
- **Position & Motion Analysis:**
  - Rear-left alignment.
  - Adjusted longitudinal distance = -4.04 m, adjusted lateral distance = 1.89 m.
  - Moving away from ego vehicle with decreasing negative relative velocity.
- **TTC & MDC Calculations:**
  - Longitudinal: Since moving away, TTC is not a concern.
  - MDC for lateral direction is stable and increasing.
- **Risk Assessment:**
  - Low risk due to increasing separation.

#### Obstacle 30674:
- **Position & Motion Analysis:**
  - Behind ego vehicle with exact lateral alignment.
  - Adjusted longitudinal distance = -1.24 m, adjusted lateral distance = 0.00 m.
  - Rapid approach with positive relative velocity.
- **TTC & MDC Calculations:**
  - Calculated TTC for longitudinal approach: \(1.24 \, \text{m} / 7.46 \, \text{m/s} \approx 0.17 \, \text{seconds}\).
  - MDC in the lateral direction is 0.00 m.
- **Risk Assessment:**
  - Extreme risk imminent due to low TTC in longitudinal approach and perfect lateral alignment.

#### Obstacle 30675:
- **Position & Motion Analysis:**
  - Rear-left alignment.
  - Adjusted longitudinal distance = -16.42 m, adjusted lateral distance = 0.05 m.
  - Rapid approach in both directions.
- **TTC & MDC Calculations:**
  - Calculated TTC for lateral approach: \(0.05 \, \text{m} / 6.76 \, \text{m/s} \approx 0.007 \, \text{seconds}\).
  - MDC in lateral direction is reducing to a near-collision.
- **Risk Assessment:**
  - Extreme risk level due to extremely low TTC in lateral approach.

#### Obstacle 30676:
- **Position & Motion Analysis:**
  - Left side alignment.
  - Adjusted longitudinal distance = 0.00 m, adjusted lateral distance = 1.88 m.
  - Stable separation with no lateral velocity.
- **TTC & MDC Calculations:**
  - No significant convergence in lateral direction.
- **Risk Assessment:**
  - Negligible risk due to stable separation.

#### Obstacle 30677:
- **Position & Motion Analysis:**
  - Front-left alignment.
  - Adjusted longitudinal distance = 9.66 m, adjusted lateral distance = 2.22 m.
  - Approaching longitudinally but with a low closing speed.
- **TTC & MDC Calculations:**
  - Longitudinal TTC: \(9.66 \, \text{m} / 0.57 \, \text{m/s} \approx 16.95 \, \text{seconds}\).
  - Adequate separation.
- **Risk Assessment:**
  - Negligible risk due to high TTC and both dimensions maintaining adequate separation.

#### Obstacle 30678:
- **Position & Motion Analysis:**
  - Front-left alignment.
  - Adjusted longitudinal distance = 1.98 m, adjusted lateral distance = 1.92 m.
  - Very slow approach.
- **TTC & MDC Calculations:**
  - Calculated TTC for longitudinal approach: \(1.98 \, \text{m} / 0.40 \, \text{m/s} \approx 4.95 \, \text{seconds}\).
  - MDC for both dimensions exceeds collision thresholds.
- **Risk Assessment:**
  - Low risk due to lengthy TTC and minimal changes in trajectory.

#### Obstacle 30680:
- **Position & Motion Analysis:**
  - Front-left alignment.
  - Adjusted longitudinal distance = 17.87 m, adjusted lateral distance = 2.95 m.
  - Approaching with low speed in both directions.
- **TTC & MDC Calculations:**
  - Longitudinal TTC: \(17.87 \, \text{m} / 1.08 \, \text{m/s} \approx 16.54 \, \text{seconds}\).
- **Risk Assessment:**
  - Negligible risk due to high TTC and large separation.

### Final Analysis:
- **Extreme Risk** identified for Obstacle 30674 and 30675 due to extremely low TTCs both longitudinally and laterally, indicating urgent action is required to avoid collision with these approaching obstacles given their current trajectories and velocities.
- Other obstacles are assessed with varying lower risk levels due to stable or improving distances and low relative velocities.
