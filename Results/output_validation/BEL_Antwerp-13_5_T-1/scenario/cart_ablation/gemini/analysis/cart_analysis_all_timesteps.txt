Obstacle 30674 shows the highest risk.  It is in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle (120) and its future trajectory indicates a likely collision. At t=7.3, obstacle 30674 is at (-303.9815, -221.8494) with a velocity of 7.861 and acceleration of 0.8488 while the ego vehicle is at (-306.9728, -224.8681) with velocity 0.2929 and decelerating at -0.2096.  Given the large velocity difference and proximity, a collision is highly likely in the next few timesteps unless obstacle 30674 brakes significantly.  No other obstacles pose an immediate collision risk.
