Obstacle 30674 is in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle and is rapidly approaching from behind.  The velocity difference suggests a high probability of a collision within the next few seconds if the ego vehicle does not accelerate or the obstacle vehicle decelerates.  Given the short time horizon and closing distance, this is deemed an Extreme Risk. Other obstacles are further away or in different lanelets, posing less immediate risk.
