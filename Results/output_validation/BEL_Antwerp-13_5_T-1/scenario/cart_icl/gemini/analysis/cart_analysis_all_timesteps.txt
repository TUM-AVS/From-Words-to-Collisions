### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 30671.0
- Distance Risk reason: Stationary and laterally separated from ego's lanelet. No risk observed in the provided timesteps.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Stationary, poses no immediate time-related risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 30674.0
- Distance Risk reason: In the same lanelet and rapidly approaching the ego vehicle.  The distance is decreasing over time.
- Distance safety score: 1
- Time Risk reason: High velocity relative to the ego vehicle, closing quickly. Acceleration is not mitigating the risk effectively.
- Time safety score: 1
- Overall Risk score: 1

- Obstacle ID: 30675.0
- Distance Risk reason:  Laterally separated and in a different lanelet.  No risk observed.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Moving away from the ego vehicle laterally.  No immediate time-related risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 30676.0
- Distance Risk reason: Laterally separated from ego's lanelet. No risk observed in the provided timesteps.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Almost stationary, poses no immediate time-related risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 30677.0
- Distance Risk reason: Laterally separated from ego's lanelet. No risk observed in the provided timesteps.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Slow-moving and decelerating, does not pose a time-related risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 30678.0
- Distance Risk reason: Laterally separated from ego's lanelet. No risk observed in the provided timesteps.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Very slow-moving and decelerating, no risk observed.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 30680.0
- Distance Risk reason: Laterally separated from ego's lanelet. No risk observed in the provided timesteps.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Moving, but poses no immediate time-related risk due to lateral separation.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5


### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. At the latest timestep (7.3 seconds), obstacle 30674.0 is in the same lanelet (120) as the ego vehicle (30670.0).
2. Obstacle 30674.0 has been consistently approaching the ego vehicle over the observed timesteps.
3. The relative velocity and decreasing distance between the ego and obstacle 30674.0 indicate a high probability of collision if no evasive action is taken.
4. Therefore, this is considered an extreme risk scenario due to the imminent collision potential with obstacle 30674.0.

### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
  "CollisionObstacles": null,
  "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {
    "ObstacleID": "30674.0",
    "OverallRiskScore": 1
  },
  "ScenarioAnalysis": {
    "IsCollisionScenario": false,
    "Reasoning": "Obstacle 30674.0 poses an extreme risk due to its high closing velocity and decreasing distance to the ego vehicle within the same lanelet.  While not a collision yet, it is highly likely without intervention."
  }
