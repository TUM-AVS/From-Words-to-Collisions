### Obstacle Analysis:

#### Obstacle ID: 30671.0
- **Distance Risk Reason**: This obstacle has remained stationary at position (-298.4398, -221.1483) over multiple timesteps while the ego vehicle is moving away towards (-306.9728, -224.8681). 
- **Distance Safety Score**: 5
- **Time Risk Reason**: There is no change in orientation or velocity of the obstacle indicating no movement or acceleration towards the ego.
- **Time Safety Score**: 5
- **Overall Risk Score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 30674.0
- **Distance Risk Reason**: This obstacle has been consistently moving towards and within the vicinity of the ego vehicle, being at position (-303.9815, -221.8494) adjacent to the ego's path.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 3
- **Time Risk Reason**: The obstacle has a high velocity and shows changes in position indicating a trajectory towards the ego vehicle in the same lanelet, suggesting a moderate risk.
- **Time Safety Score**: 3
- **Overall Risk Score**: 3

#### Obstacle ID: 30675.0
- **Distance Risk Reason**: Positioned at (-292.7737, -210.7435), far from the ego's lanelet. Its position indicates it's moving on a parallel path far from the ego.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 4
- **Time Risk Reason**: It has a consistent high velocity with positional changes away from the ego, indicating no immediate threat or trajectory overlap.
- **Time Safety Score**: 4
- **Overall Risk Score**: 4

#### Obstacle ID: 30676.0
- **Distance Risk Reason**: Located near the ego vehicle, but stationary at almost the same coordinates over several timesteps.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 5
- **Time Risk Reason**: Minimal velocity and negligible acceleration show that it poses no time-based risk.
- **Time Safety Score**: 5
- **Overall Risk Score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 30677.0
- **Distance Risk Reason**: Positioned at (-314.0727, -237.5899), remains at a distance from the ego. Their paths do not intersect imminently.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 5
- **Time Risk Reason**: Slow velocity and changes illustrate no imminent threat given current trajectories.
- **Time Safety Score**: 5
- **Overall Risk Score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 30678.0
- **Distance Risk Reason**: Location at (-308.928, -231.9153) places it behind the ego vehicle, suggesting a minimal risk scenario in terms of distance.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 5
- **Time Risk Reason**: Very low velocity and little to no acceleration reinforce negligible threat.
- **Time Safety Score**: 5
- **Overall Risk Score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 30680.0
- **Distance Risk Reason**: Positioned at (-319.2319, -243.8924) with increasing distance from the ego vehicle, motion indicates an absence of collision risk.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 5
- **Time Risk Reason**: Adequate distance and trajectory movement show it is moving away from the ego vehicle.
- **Time Safety Score**: 5
- **Overall Risk Score**: 5

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
None of the obstacles present immediate collision threats. The ego vehicle is maneuvering safely according to its path. Obstacle 30674.0, although near, maintains a constant position relative to its previous path, eliminating urgent collision risk despite being in the same lanelet.
