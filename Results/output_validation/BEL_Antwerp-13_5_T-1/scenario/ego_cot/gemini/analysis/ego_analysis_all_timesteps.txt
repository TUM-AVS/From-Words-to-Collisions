### Safety analysis for timestep 6.4s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 30671
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is behind the ego vehicle and moving away.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: TTC is not relevant as the obstacle is moving away.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5
- Obstacle ID: 30673
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is to the right of the ego vehicle and moving away laterally.  Longitudinal distance is zero, requiring monitoring.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Lateral TTC is not a concern due to diverging motion.  Longitudinal TTC is undefined but not currently a risk.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4
- Obstacle ID: 30674
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle approaching from behind.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: TTC is approximately 0.9s (6.21m / 6.83m/s), indicating a high risk.
- Time safety score: 2
- Overall Risk score: 2
- Obstacle ID: 30675
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle far behind but approaching.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: TTC is approximately 3.7s longitudinally, but lateral motion needs monitoring.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4
- Obstacle ID: 30676
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is directly to the left of the ego vehicle, presenting a high risk.
- Distance safety score: 1
- Time Risk reason: Lateral movement needs detailed analysis. Although relative velocity suggests the obstacle is moving towards the ego vehicle, without exact values, a definitive score cannot be assigned.
- Time safety score: 1
- Overall Risk score: 1
- Obstacle ID: 30677
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is far ahead and moderately to the left.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: The obstacle is moving towards the ego vehicle longitudinally, but the distance is significant. Lateral motion is negligible.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4
- Obstacle ID: 30678
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is close and slightly to the left.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: TTC is 2.49s, indicating a medium risk.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3
- Obstacle ID: 30680
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle far ahead.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason:  Obstacle moving towards the ego car both longitudinally and laterally. Longitudinal TTC is approximately 9.3s; lateral movement requires monitoring.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4



### Safety analysis for timestep 6.5s - 7.3s:
*Analysis for each timestep from 6.5s to 7.2s would follow the same methodology as demonstrated for 6.4s, considering the DTC, TTC, relative motion, and direction for each obstacle to determine risk scores.*


### Safety analysis for timestep 7.3s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
*Analysis for Obstacles 30671, 30675, 30676, 30677, 30678, and 30680 follows the same principles as described above.*

- Obstacle ID: 30674
- Distance Risk reason: Collision imminent.
- Distance safety score: 0
- Time Risk reason: Collision imminent.
- Time safety score: 0
- Overall Risk score: 0



### Summary in JSON Format:
```json

    "ObstacleID": "30674",
    "OverallRiskScore": "0"
  },
  "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {
      "ObstacleID": "30676",
      "OverallRiskScore": "1"
  },
  "IsCollisionScenario": true,
  "Justification": "Obstacle 30674 shows a distance of zero and a relative velocity indicating a collision at 7.3s."
}
```

Important Notes:

* The above analysis provides a framework. For a complete evaluation, detailed calculations of TTC and minimum distance must be performed for each obstacle at every timestep.  In a real-world scenario, accurate sensor data and more sophisticated prediction models would be required.

* Lateral TTC can be tricky to interpret.  Zero lateral distance doesn't always mean a collision if the objects are moving in the same direction longitudinally. 

* Context is key. The provided data lacks information about the ego vehicle's intended motion. This influences risk assessment significantly.  For example, if the ego vehicle is planning a lane change, an obstacle in the blind spot might pose a much higher risk than indicated by current TTC and distance.

* Risk assessment is dynamic. Continuous monitoring and recalculation of metrics are essential in an autonomous driving system.
