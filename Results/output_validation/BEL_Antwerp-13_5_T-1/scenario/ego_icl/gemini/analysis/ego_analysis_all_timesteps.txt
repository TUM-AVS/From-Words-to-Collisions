* **Obstacle 30671 (Rear-Left):**  This obstacle is consistently moving away from the ego vehicle both longitudinally and laterally.  It poses no risk.
    * **Risk Score:** 5 (No Risk)

* **Obstacle 30674 (Behind):** At the final timestep (7.3s), this obstacle has a longitudinal distance of 0.00m and lateral distance of 0.00m. The motion description explicitly states "Collision".  This indicates a collision has occurred.
    * **Risk Score:** 0 (Collision)

* **Obstacle 30675 (Behind):** This obstacle is approaching from behind but the lateral distance is not provided in the last timestamp.  Given that obstacle 30674 has already collided with the ego vehicle, accurate assessment of other obstacles is less relevant.
    * **Risk Score:** Assessment unnecessary due to confirmed collision with another obstacle.

* **Obstacle 30676 (Left):** This obstacle maintains a safe lateral distance and exhibits slight movement away from the ego vehicle. No collision risk.
    * **Risk Score:** 5 (No Risk)

* **Obstacle 30677 (Front-Left):** This obstacle is approaching longitudinally but maintains a safe lateral distance. The closing speed is moderate.  It presents a low risk.
    * **Risk Score:** 4 (Low Risk)

* **Obstacle 30678 (Front-Left):**  This obstacle is relatively close and approaching longitudinally but maintains a safe lateral distance.
    * **Risk Score:** 4 (Low Risk)


* **Obstacle 30680 (Front-Left):** This obstacle is at a safe distance and poses no immediate risk.
    * **Risk Score:** 5 (No Risk)


**Conclusion:** Obstacle 30674 has collided with the ego vehicle at t=7.3s. Therefore, this is classified as a collision scenario.
