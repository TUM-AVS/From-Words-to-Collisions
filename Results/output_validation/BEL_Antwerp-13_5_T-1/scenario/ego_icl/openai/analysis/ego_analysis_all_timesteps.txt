In the given scenario at the most recent timestep (7.3 seconds), let's perform a detailed analysis for each obstacle based on their adjusted distances, velocities, and motion descriptions. We'll calculate the Time-to-Collision (TTC) and Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC) where relevant, and then assess the risk level associated with each obstacle.

### Obstacle Analyses:

#### Obstacle 30671:
- **Position**: Rear-left
- **Adjusted Distances**: Longitudinal = -4.12 m, Lateral = 1.88 m
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal = -0.29 m/s, Lateral = 0.00 m/s
- **Motion**: Moving away longitudinally, no lateral motion

- **Analysis**: 
  - Since it is moving away longitudinally and there is no lateral relative motion, collision risk is minimal.
  - No Risk (5)

#### Obstacle 30674:
- **Position**: Collision (indicated by exact alignment)
- **Adjusted Distances**: Longitudinal = 0.00 m, Lateral = 0.00 m
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal = 7.57 m/s, Lateral = -0.09 m/s
- **Motion**: Exact alignment both longitudinally and laterally

- **Analysis**: 
  - Exact alignment with very small relative distances both longitudinally and laterally, and positive closing velocity.
  - Collision (0)

#### Obstacle 30675:
- **Position**: Behind
- **Adjusted Distances**: Longitudinal = -15.52 m, Lateral = 0.00 m
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal = 4.51 m/s, Lateral = -7.07 m/s
- **Motion**: Indicated as approaching from behind and laterally aligned

- **Analysis**: 
  - Despite approaching from behind, given the velocity and distance, collision is not immediate but needs monitoring for lateral shift.
  - Medium Risk (3)

#### Obstacle 30676:
- **Position**: Left
- **Adjusted Distances**: Longitudinal = 0.00 m, Lateral = 1.88 m
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal = -0.30 m/s, Lateral = 0.00 m/s
- **Motion**: Driving toward laterally from left

- **Analysis**: 
  - Lateral alignment at 1.88 m with no approaching velocity suggests low-risk potential.
  - Low Risk (4)

#### Obstacle 30677:
- **Position**: Front-left
- **Adjusted Distances**: Longitudinal = 9.55 m, Lateral = 2.22 m
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal = -0.46 m/s, Lateral = -0.01 m/s
- **Motion**: Approaching from the front-left

- **Analysis**: 
  - Considering distances and relative motion, the risk is minimal.
  - No Risk (5)

#### Obstacle 30678:
- **Position**: Front-left
- **Adjusted Distances**: Longitudinal = 1.89 m, Lateral = 1.93 m
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal = -0.32 m/s, Lateral = 0.00 m/s
- **Motion**: Approaching from the front-left

- **Analysis**: 
  - Fairly close approach in both dimensions. Monitoring required.
  - Medium Risk (3)

#### Obstacle 30680:
- **Position**: Front-left
- **Adjusted Distances**: Longitudinal = 17.66 m, Lateral = 2.95 m
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal = -0.92 m/s, Lateral = -0.07 m/s
- **Motion**: Approaching from the front-left

- **Analysis**: 
  - Distances are sufficient to have negligible risk.
  - No Risk (5)

### Conclusion:
A collision is occurring with Obstacle 30674 due to exact alignment and active closing velocities, creating a high risk scenario.
