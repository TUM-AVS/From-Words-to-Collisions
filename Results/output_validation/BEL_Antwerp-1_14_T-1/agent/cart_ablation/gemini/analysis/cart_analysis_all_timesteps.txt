Here's the collision risk analysis:

**Obstacle 30753:** This obstacle shows a concerning trend. While not an immediate collision risk at the last reported timestep (9.6 seconds), its trajectory suggests a potential future collision.  The x-coordinate of the ego vehicle is increasing while obstacle 30753.0's x-coordinate is decreasing, meaning they are moving towards each other.  Additionally, both are moving south (decreasing y-coordinate), with obstacle 30753 moving slightly faster southward than the ego vehicle.  These combined movements suggest they are on a collision course.  Further projection of their trajectories is needed to assess the imminence and severity of the potential collision. Because of this concerning trajectory, I classify this as Extreme Risk (1).

**Obstacle 30762:**  This obstacle does not pose an immediate threat. The y-coordinates suggest they are separated by a significant distance, and their trajectories are not converging in a way that indicates an imminent collision risk. This warrants continued monitoring, but for now, the risk is Negligible (5).
