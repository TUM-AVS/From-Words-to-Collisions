Obstacle 30753: This obstacle starts relatively far from the ego vehicle but gets progressively closer over the timesteps.  By 8.9 seconds, the x-positions are quite close, although the y-positions still provide some separation.  However, the continued movement of both vehicles suggests a high risk of collision if their trajectories don't change. Considering the close proximity and the consistent approach, this obstacle represents a high risk (2).

Obstacle 30762: This obstacle remains relatively far from the ego vehicle throughout the provided timesteps. The y-positions show consistent separation, and there's no indication of converging trajectories.  This obstacle presents a negligible risk (5).
