Obstacle 30753 shows a concerning trend. While not immediately colliding, its trajectory and relatively close proximity warrant attention. Further analysis is needed to determine the precise TTC and MDC, but a high risk assessment is appropriate given the available data. Obstacle 30762 is not an immediate concern as the distance between it and the ego vehicle is relatively large and increasing.
