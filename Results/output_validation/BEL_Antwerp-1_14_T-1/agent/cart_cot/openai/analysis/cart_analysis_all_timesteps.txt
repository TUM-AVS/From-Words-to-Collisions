**Analysis for Risky Obstacles:**

At the most recent timestamp (9.6 seconds), the ego vehicle is located at (5.9173, -102.7611) with a velocity of 10.717 m/s. Two obstacles' data is considered here:

1. **Obstacle 30753.0**: Located at (30.9504, -114.5213) and moving with a velocity of 7.6677 m/s. The relative motion shows that the obstacle is diverging away from the ego path and their respective lanelets do not overlap, reducing direct collision risk. However, its orientation suggests it could gradually enter into a conflicting path or proximity.

2. **Obstacle 30762.0**: Data ends at 9.1 seconds, indicating likely it did not pose an immediate risk past this point as its trajectory shows a tendency to continue in its lane at a safe distance.

Using the trends from the timesteps, the lateral separation and speed of both obstacles means the likelihood of immediate collision is low. However, ongoing relative analysis should be maintained to ensure safety as time progresses.

**JSON Output:**

```json
{
    "CollisionObstacles": [],
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "30753.0",
        "OverallRiskScore": 1
    },
    "HighRiskObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "30753.0",
        "OverallRiskScore": 2
    }
}
```

Explanation:  
- "ExtremeRiskObstacle" category applies due to the proximity of "ObstacleID": "30753.0" if considering its continuing path.
