### Analysis of the Scenario:

1. **Ego Vehicle (ID: 30758)**:
   - Position: (5.9173, -102.7611)
   - Velocity: 10.717 m/s
   - Acceleration: 0.3303 m/s²
   - Orientation: 1.477 rad (~84.6°)

2. **Obstacle 30753**:
   - Position: (30.9504, -114.5213)
   - Velocity: 7.6677 m/s
   - Acceleration: -0.4868 m/s²
   - Orientation: -2.0255 rad (~-116.1°)
   - Relative Position: (25.0331, -11.7602) from ego
   - Relative Velocity: ~3.05 m/s (ego is faster)
   - TTC: Not directly approaching (lateral distance is significant)
   - MDC: ~27.65 m (calculated using Euclidean distance)
   - Risk: **Low (4)** - The obstacle is moving away laterally and is not on a collision course.

3. **Obstacle 30762** (last seen at 9.2s):
   - Position: (30.9471, -122.5536)
   - Velocity: 7.2903 m/s
   - Acceleration: 0.1387 m/s²
   - Orientation: 1.1212 rad (~64.2°)
   - Relative Position: (25.0298, -19.7925) from ego
   - Relative Velocity: ~3.43 m/s (ego is faster)
   - TTC: Not directly approaching (lateral distance is significant)
   - MDC: ~31.85 m (calculated using Euclidean distance)
   - Risk: **Low (4)** - The obstacle is moving away and is not on a collision course.

### Conclusion:
- No obstacles pose an immediate or extreme risk to the ego vehicle.
- Both obstacles are at a safe distance and not on a collision trajectory.
