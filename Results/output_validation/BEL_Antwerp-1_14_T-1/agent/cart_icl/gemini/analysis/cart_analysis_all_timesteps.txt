At timestep 9.6s, the ego vehicle is in lanelet 1001.0, traveling at 10.717 m/s with an acceleration of 0.3303 m/s². Obstacle 30753.0 is in lanelet 527.0 at (30.9504, -114.5213) with a velocity of 7.6677 m/s and an acceleration of -0.4868 m/s².  No data is available for obstacle 30762.0 at this timestep.

Across the provided timesteps, the ego vehicle appears to be changing lanes, as the lanelet ID changes from 136.0 to 1001.0 between 9.1s and 9.2s. Additionally, both the velocity and acceleration of the ego vehicle are increasing. Obstacle 30753 appears to be braking, indicated by the negative acceleration values observed in the later timesteps. However, it's difficult to conclusively assess the collision risk without further information on the lanelet geometry and the relative headings of the vehicles. The provided orientations are insufficient for precise trajectory prediction.  A risk assessment will be made based on assuming the vehicles are on a collision course, though this is an assumption.

Due to the large difference in Y coordinates (ego around -103, obstacle around -115), and with the ego vehicle continuing at a greater velocity with positive acceleration, I will classify the risk with obstacle 30753 as lower.

Given that information for obstacle 30762.0 is missing for the latest timestep, I cannot assess the risk accurately and will thus assign a medium risk for now, which should prompt further analysis and/or data acquisition.
