To analyze the scenario at the most recent timestep (9.6 seconds), we consider the relative positions, velocities, and trajectories of the ego vehicle and the obstacles:

### Ego Vehicle:
- Position: (5.9173, -102.7611)
- Velocity: 10.717 m/s
- Located in lanelet 1001.0

### Obstacles:
1. **Obstacle 30753.0:**
   - Position: (30.9504, -114.5213)
   - Velocity: 7.6677 m/s
   - Located in lanelet 527.0

2. **Obstacle 30762.0:** (not present at 9.6 seconds data)

### Collision Risk Evaluation:

#### Obstacle 30753.0:
- **Relative Position:** This obstacle is located further on the x-axis and also on a different lanelet.
- **Relative Velocity:** The obstacle is moving slower and in a parallel trajectory compared to the ego vehicle; thus, its trajectory isn't converging toward the ego vehicle.
- **TTC and MDC:** Given the parallel and divergent lanelet paths, it's unlikely that a collision trajectory will develop.

Given distances, relative velocities, and lanelet data, this obstacle represents a low immediate collision risk as it follows a different path and moves at a slower relative pace.

#### Obstacle 30762.0:
- No data was available for this obstacle at the current timestep (9.6 seconds), indicating it may have moved out of the area or its data stopped being tracked.

### Conclusion:
At the moment, there are no obstacles clearly on an imminent collision path with the ego vehicle.
