At the most recent timestamp (9.6 seconds), Obstacle 30753 is located at a longitudinal distance of -4.86 meters and a lateral distance of -24.41 meters relative to the ego vehicle, placing it in the Rear-right zone.  It is moving away longitudinally at -17.89 m/s and towards the ego laterally at 2.71 m/s. While the lateral movement is towards the ego, the lateral distance is substantial and the lateral velocity isn't high enough to pose an immediate threat. The high longitudinal velocity away from the ego vehicle substantially reduces any collision risk. Due to the large lateral distance and the receding longitudinal movement, the overall risk is assessed as low.

Since the minimum distances are greater than 5 meters and TTC is likely to be much greater than 5 seconds (due to diverging longitudinal trajectories), Obstacle 30753 is not considered to be at high risk of collision. Therefore, it's assigned a risk score of 5 for Proximity, MDC, and TTC resulting in an overall low risk.  Obstacle 30762 is not present in the last provided timestep so not a collision risk
