At timestamp 9.6 seconds, obstacle 30753 is located rear-right of the ego vehicle, with a longitudinal distance of -4.86 meters and a lateral distance of -24.41 meters.  The negative longitudinal distance indicates it is behind the ego vehicle. Its lateral velocity (2.71 m/s) suggests it's moving towards the ego vehicle laterally (from the right), while its longitudinal velocity (-17.89 m/s) shows it's moving away from the ego vehicle longitudinally.  Given the distances and the fact that the obstacle is moving away longitudinally, while its lateral movement doesn't pose an immediate threat, this obstacle is assessed as low risk.

Risk Levels:
0: Collision - Physical contact occurred or unavoidable
1: Extreme Risk - Immediate collision likely
2: High Risk - Close to collision, needs quick action
3: Medium Risk - Manageable with proper reaction
4: Low Risk - Minimal risk, sufficient time to react
5: Negligible Risk - No significant risk
