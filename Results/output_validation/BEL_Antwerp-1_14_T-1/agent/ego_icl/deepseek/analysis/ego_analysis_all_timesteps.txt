### Obstacle-by-Obstacle Analysis

#### Obstacle 30753 (Rear-right of ego car at 9.6 seconds)
- **Adjusted Distances**: 
  - Longitudinal: -4.86 m (behind ego)
  - Lateral: -24.41 m (right of ego)
- **Relative Velocity**:
  - Longitudinal: -17.89 m/s (moving away from ego)
  - Lateral: 2.71 m/s (moving toward ego laterally)
- **Motion Description**: 
  - "Obstacle is moving away in behind longitudinally. Obstacle is driving toward the ego car laterally from the right."

**Trajectory Analysis**:
- Over the timesteps, the obstacle transitions from front-right to right to rear-right.
- Longitudinal distance changes from positive (front) to negative (rear), indicating the obstacle has passed the ego vehicle.
- Lateral distance decreases slowly (from -26.92 m to -24.41 m), but remains large (>24 m).

**TTC Calculation**:
- **Lateral TTC**: 24.41 m / 2.71 m/s ≈ 9.01 s (No Risk, TTC > 5.0 s)
- **Longitudinal TTC**: Not applicable (moving away, relative velocity negative)

**MDC Calculation**:
- The obstacle is moving away longitudinally and laterally is still very far (24.41 m). 
- MDC is effectively the current lateral distance (24.41 m), which is >> 5.0 m (No Risk).

**Overall Risk**: 
- **Risk Score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)

#### Obstacle 30762 (Rear-right of ego car at 9.3 seconds)
- **Adjusted Distances**:
  - Longitudinal: -8.77 m (behind ego)
  - Lateral: -25.14 m (right of ego)
- **Relative Velocity**:
  - Longitudinal: -3.37 m/s (moving away from ego)
  - Lateral: -2.55 m/s (moving away from ego laterally)
- **Motion Description**:
  - "Obstacle is moving away in behind longitudinally. Obstacle is moving away laterally to the right."

**Trajectory Analysis**:
- The obstacle is consistently moving away in both longitudinal and lateral directions.
- Distances increase over time (longitudinal: -7.23 m → -8.77 m, lateral: -23.86 m → -25.14 m).

**TTC Calculation**:
- Not applicable (both velocity components negative, moving away).

**MDC Calculation**:
- The obstacle is diverging in both dimensions. 
- MDC is effectively the current distance, which is very large (>20 m).

**Overall Risk**:
- **Risk Score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)

### Reasoning:
- Neither obstacle poses any significant risk (Risk Score 5 for both).
- Obstacle 30753 is moving away longitudinally and is very far laterally (>24 m).
- Obstacle 30762 is moving away in both dimensions.
- No collision or extreme risk is detected.
