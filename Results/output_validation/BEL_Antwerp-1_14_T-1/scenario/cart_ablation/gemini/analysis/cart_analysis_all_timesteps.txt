At t=9.8s, Ego is at (6.1172, -100.6281) in lanelet 1002.0.

Obstacle 30753.0 is at (30.2785, -115.9016) in lanelet 527.0.  While the y-coordinates indicate some separation, the x-coordinates suggest potential for a collision given the ego vehicle's trajectory and velocity. Further information on lanelet geometry and vehicle dimensions are needed for accurate assessment.  This obstacle is tagged as potentially high risk for now.

Obstacle 30762.0's last reported position at t=9.2s is (30.9471, -122.5536) in lanelet 528.0.  Without more recent data, an accurate risk assessment isn't possible, but based on previous positions, this obstacle is likely not a high risk at t=9.8s.  Additional information is needed.
