At t=9.8s, Ego is at (6.1172, -100.6281) in lanelet 1002.

Obstacle 30753 is at (30.2785, -115.9016) in lanelet 527.  While the y-coordinates are somewhat different, the x-coordinates suggest a potential collision risk as Ego moves forward.  The trajectory history of this obstacle shows it consistently moving closer to Ego's likely path. This obstacle needs closer examination, but based on this limited data, it presents a potential risk.

Obstacle 30762 is not present in the 9.8s timestep, so it is no longer considered.

Given the limited information and the rate at which Ego's x-coordinate is changing, it is difficult to definitively say a collision is *imminent* within the next immediate timestep.  However, Obstacle 30753 warrants attention as a possible high risk (2) due to the closing x-coordinates and the consistent trajectory pattern. We do not have enough information about lanelet relationships or obstacle sizes to definitively assign a risk score of 0 or 1.
