### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. No obstacles are in the same lanelet as ego (1002).
2. Closest obstacles (30763.0, 30764.0) show diverging trajectories.
3. All TTC calculations show >5s for potential intercepts.
4. No collision course detected in any obstacle's trajectory history.
5. All obstacles maintain or increase distance over time.
