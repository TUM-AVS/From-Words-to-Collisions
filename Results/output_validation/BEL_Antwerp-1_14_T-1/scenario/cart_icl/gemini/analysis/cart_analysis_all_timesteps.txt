### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:
- **Obstacle ID:** 30753.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is moving towards the ego vehicle's path, but the lateral distance is still significant at the most recent timestep.  History shows a concerning trend of decreasing lateral separation.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: Relative velocities and accelerations suggest that the time to closest approach is not immediate, but reducing over time.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3

- **Obstacle ID:** 30762.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is laterally far from the ego vehicle and moving away based on the provided data. The history confirms this trend.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason:  The relative motion and distance suggest no immediate time-related risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5


### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. **Identify Potential Conflicts:** At the last timestep (9.8s), Obstacle 30753.0 shows the most concerning behavior, moving closer to Ego's predicted path. Obstacle 30762.0 is moving further away.
2. **Analyze Trajectories:** Obstacle 30753's history indicates a consistent approach towards Ego's lanelet. While not an immediate collision, it presents a medium risk due to decreasing separation.
3. **Risk Assessment:** No immediate collision is predicted, so `IsCollisionScenario` is false. Obstacle 30753 warrants attention due to its medium risk level.
