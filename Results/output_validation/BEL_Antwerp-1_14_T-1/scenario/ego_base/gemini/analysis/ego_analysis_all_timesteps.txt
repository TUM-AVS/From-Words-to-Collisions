At t=9.8s, Obstacle 30753 is located rear-right of the ego vehicle with a longitudinal distance of -8.45m and lateral distance of -23.87m.  It has a relative longitudinal velocity of -17.99 m/s (moving away from ego) and a lateral velocity of 2.70 m/s (moving towards the ego). Although the lateral velocity indicates the obstacle is moving towards the ego vehicle, the lateral distance is significant and the obstacle is moving away longitudinally.  This doesn't pose an immediate collision risk. Therefore, no collision or extreme risk is detected at this timestep.
