### Safety analysis for timestep 8.9s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 30753
- Distance Risk reason: The obstacle is at the same longitudinal and lateral position as the ego vehicle (0, 0).  This indicates an extremely high risk of collision.
- Distance safety score: 0
- Time Risk reason: Lateral relative velocity is positive, indicating the obstacle is moving towards the ego vehicle laterally. The longitudinal relative velocity is negative, but since the vehicles are already overlapping, this does not mitigate the risk.
- Time safety score: 0
- Overall Risk score: 0
- Obstacle ID: 30762
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is located behind and to the right of the ego vehicle at (-7.84, -7.84) and moving away in both directions.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Both longitudinal and lateral relative velocities are negative, indicating the obstacle is moving away from the ego vehicle.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

### Safety analysis for timestep 9.0s - 9.8s:
(Analysis for obstacle 30762 remains largely the same throughout these timesteps, with it consistently moving away from the ego vehicle. Therefore, detailed analysis for 30762 is omitted for brevity, with its Overall Risk score remaining at 5).

- Obstacle ID: 30753 (Analysis continues from 8.9s onwards)
This obstacle starts at the same position as the ego vehicle and their lateral distance remains very small over time. Although its longitudinal distance eventually starts increasing, the lateral movement is the primary concern, and it continues to pose a high risk of collision.  The small lateral distance combined with positive lateral relative velocity (meaning the object is moving closer laterally) suggests a sustained high risk. This makes a near-term collision highly likely. Note the longitudinal relative velocity is negative but given the initial starting position, the obstacle still represents a collision risk until the lateral relative velocity is no longer positive and there is some significant lateral distance.


### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
    "CollisionObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "30753",
        "OverallRiskScore": "0"
    },
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null,
    "IsCollisionScenario": true,
    "Justification": "Obstacle 30753 starts in the same position and its lateral motion and velocity indicate a high probability of a collision.  The sustained near-zero lateral distance between the ego vehicle and obstacle 30753 through at least time 9.4 confirms a collision."
