### Obstacle-by-Obstacle Analysis (Most Recent Timestep: 9.8s)

#### **Obstacle 30753 (Rear-Right)**
- **Adjusted Position**: Longitudinal -8.45m (behind), Lateral -23.87m (right)
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal -17.99 m/s (moving away behind), Lateral 2.70 m/s (approaching laterally from right)
- **Motion Description**: "Obstacle is moving away in behind longitudinally. Obstacle is driving toward the ego car laterally from the right."

**Trajectory Analysis (9.3s → 9.8s)**:
- Lateral distance decreases from -25.23m to -23.87m (approaching at ~2.7 m/s).
- Longitudinal distance increases negatively (moving further behind at ~17.99 m/s).

**Risk Assessment**:
1. **Lateral (Primary Focus for Right-Side Obstacle)**:
   - **Current Lateral Distance**: 23.87m (far beyond 5.0m threshold → No Risk for MDC).
   - **Lateral TTC**: 23.87m / 2.70 m/s ≈ 8.84s (> 5.0s → No Risk).
   - **Trend**: Despite approaching laterally, the large distance and slow closing speed make collision unlikely.

2. **Longitudinal (Secondary Focus)**:
   - Moving away longitudinally (negative relative velocity) → No Risk.

**Overall Risk for 30753**: **5 (No Risk)**. No imminent collision threat.

#### **Obstacle 30762 (Rear-Right)**
- **Last Observed at 9.2s** (not present in 9.3s–9.8s). Likely out of sensor range or no longer relevant.
- **Final Data (9.2s)**: Longitudinal -8.77m, Lateral -25.14m.
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal -3.37 m/s (moving away), Lateral -2.55 m/s (moving away right).
- **Motion Description**: "Obstacle is moving away in behind longitudinally. Obstacle is moving away laterally to the right."

**Risk Assessment**:
- Both distances increasing (no convergence) → **5 (No Risk)**.

### **Collision Scenario Determination**
- **Obstacle 30753**: No Risk (Score 5). Large lateral distance and slow approach speed.
- **Obstacle 30762**: No Risk (Score 5). Moving away in both dimensions.
- **No obstacles** meet criteria for Collision (0) or Extreme Risk (1).
