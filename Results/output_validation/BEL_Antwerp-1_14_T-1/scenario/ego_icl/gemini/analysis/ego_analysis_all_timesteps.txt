* **Obstacle 30753 Analysis:**

This obstacle has consistently been to the right of the ego vehicle, and the longitudinal distance has been consistently 0.00m, indicating perfect longitudinal alignment throughout the provided timeframe.  Critically, from 9.3 seconds onward, this obstacle transitions to the rear-right as it is overtaken by the ego vehicle.  The lateral distance remains large throughout (around -24 to -26 meters), meaning it's far to the right.  The obstacle *is* driving towards the ego vehicle laterally (positive lateral velocity), but given the substantial lateral separation, the movement does not pose an imminent collision risk. The longitudinal negative relative velocities confirm that obstacle 30753 is moving *away* from the ego vehicle longitudinally.

At the last timestep (9.8 seconds):

* **Longitudinal Analysis (Rear):**
    - Distance: -8.45m (behind the ego vehicle)
    - Relative Velocity: -17.99 m/s (moving away from ego vehicle)
    - TTC: Not applicable (negative relative velocity)
    - Risk (Longitudinal): 5 (No Risk)

* **Lateral Analysis (Right):**
    - Distance: -23.87m (to the right of the ego vehicle)
    - Relative Velocity: 2.70 m/s (moving towards the ego vehicle)
    - TTC: -23.87 / 2.70 = -8.84s (not applicable in a practical sense as itâ€™s moving away longitudinally and the lateral distance is large)
    - Risk (Lateral): 5 (No Risk)

* **Overall Risk (Obstacle 30753):** 5 (No Risk)


* **Obstacle 30762 Analysis:**

This obstacle is consistently behind and to the right of the ego vehicle. Both longitudinal and lateral distances are increasing (negative and getting more negative).  The negative relative velocities (both longitudinal and lateral) indicate that the obstacle is moving *away* from the ego vehicle in both dimensions.

This obstacle is not present in the most recent timestep, so it does not contribute to current collision risk. Since it was moving away from the ego vehicle in previous timesteps and we have no information suggesting a change in its trajectory, we can assume it remains a low risk.

* **Overall Risk (Obstacle 30762):** 5 (No Risk)


* **Collision Scenario Determination:**

Since no obstacles have a risk score of 0 (Collision) or 1 (Extreme Risk), this is NOT a collision scenario.
