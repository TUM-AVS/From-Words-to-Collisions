Here's the collision risk analysis:

**Obstacle 30193:** This obstacle is located in a different lanelet (1748) than the ego vehicle (1747) and maintains a safe lateral distance.  The trajectories don't intersect, indicating no immediate risk. Although the y-coordinate values suggest some proximity, the lane markings imply a physical separation.  This obstacle poses a negligible risk.

**Obstacle 30196:** Initially in lanelet 751, this obstacle transitions to lanelet 1746 at t=3.7s. This lanelet change brings it closer to the ego vehicle's lanelet (1747). While the provided data doesn't show an immediate collision, the lane change and proximity warrant attention. This obstacle presents a medium risk due to the possibility of future close interaction.

**Obstacle 30197:**  Located in lanelets 648 and later 1682, this obstacle maintains a substantial lateral distance from the ego vehicle. Its trajectory doesn't indicate any movement towards the ego vehicle's path. This obstacle presents a negligible risk.
