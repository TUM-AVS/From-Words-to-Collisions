Obstacle 30193.0: This obstacle is located in lanelet 1748.0, while the ego vehicle starts in lanelet 1746.0 and transitions to 1747.0.  The y-coordinates suggest these lanelets are parallel and adjacent. While the x-position of this obstacle is getting closer to the ego vehicle, the difference in y-coordinates remains relatively stable, around 5-6 units apart.  Combined with the consistent, though slightly fluctuating velocities of both vehicles, this suggests a low risk of collision. Risk score: 4 (Low Risk) or 5 (Negligible Risk depending on lanelet width).

Obstacle 30196.0: This obstacle begins in lanelet 751.0 and ends up in lanelet 1746.0, the ego vehicle's original lane.  The x and y coordinates indicate the obstacle starts behind the ego vehicle and gradually approaches, eventually ending up close in both x and y coordinates. The velocities do not suggest an immediate collision, but a close pass is likely, and monitoring is needed.  Risk score: 3 (Medium Risk) - 2 (High Risk if lane change is anticipated).

Obstacle 30197.0: This obstacle remains far from the ego vehicle in terms of both x and y coordinates throughout the provided timesteps. While the lanelets change from 648.0 to 1682.0, the relative distance remains substantial, posing no immediate threat. Risk score: 5 (Negligible Risk).
