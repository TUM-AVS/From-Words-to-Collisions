Obstacle 30193 shows a decreasing trend in proximity to the ego vehicle in the last few timesteps. While the recent change in acceleration is minimal, the continuous positional change towards the ego vehicle suggests a potential risk increase in the coming timesteps. Obstacle 30196 has changed lanelets and is now in the ego vehicle's lanelet (1746), warranting close monitoring. Obstacle 30197, despite some fluctuations in acceleration, maintains a lateral distance and does not present an immediate risk.
