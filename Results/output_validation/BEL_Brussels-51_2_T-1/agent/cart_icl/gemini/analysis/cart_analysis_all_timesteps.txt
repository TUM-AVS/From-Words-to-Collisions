Obstacle 30193: Located in lanelet 1748.  The obstacle is laterally separated from the ego vehicle and moving with a similar longitudinal velocity. The distance between the ego vehicle and the obstacle has been increasing. Low risk.

Obstacle 30196: Located in lanelet 1746. This obstacle is now in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle and ahead, but moving away with a higher velocity.  While the lateral distance is minimal, the increasing longitudinal separation suggests low risk.

Obstacle 30197: Located in lanelet 1682. This obstacle is laterally separated from the ego vehicle and its motion does not pose an immediate threat. Low Risk.
