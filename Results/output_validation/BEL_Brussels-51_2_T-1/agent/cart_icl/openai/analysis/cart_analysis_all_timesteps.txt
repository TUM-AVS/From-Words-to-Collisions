To assess the collision risk between the ego vehicle and the obstacles, we will examine the most recent timestep data (3.7 seconds) and recall the previous data for motion trends. This includes evaluating time to collision (TTC) and minimum distance to collision (MDC). 

### Detailed Assessment at 3.7 seconds:

**Ego Vehicle**:  
- Position: (261.5085, 42.4676)
- Orientation: 1.689902025724914 radians
- Velocity: 1.0811 m/s
- Lanelet: 1747.0

**Obstacle 30193**:
- Position: (243.629, 48.5433)
- Orientation: 2.6753 radians
- Velocity: 4.9523 m/s
- Lanelet: 1748.0

**Obstacle 30196**:
- Position: (264.9054, 38.018)
- Orientation: 2.6928 radians
- Velocity: 6.064 m/s
- Lanelet: 1746.0

**Obstacle 30197**:
- Position: (276.2095, 30.4416)
- Orientation: 2.3166 radians
- Velocity: 6.1597 m/s
- Lanelet: 1682.0

### Analysis:

1. **Obstacle 30193**:
   - Is around 18 meters lateral distance from the ego and is on a parallel lane, indicating low potential for immediate collision.
   - Relative velocity suggests obstacle is moving faster but on a separate lane direction, resulting in **Low Risk**.

2. **Obstacle 30196**:
   - Is closely positioned longitudinally, sharing the lanelet with the ego (same traffic path as it moves into lanelet 1746.0).
   - Proximate future path overlap as the obstacle moves in the same traffic direction, suggests short TTC.
   - Could pose a close overtaking risk due to relative position and speed.
   - High relative speed results in **Extreme Risk (Score: 1)** as a quick resolution is needed to avoid the collision path.

3. **Obstacle 30197**:
   - Is increasing longitudinally forward at a greater acceleration and velocity, situated on a different path trajectory.
   - Given the separate path and increasing distance, it suggests **Low Risk**.

### Conclusion:
- **Extreme Risk for Obstacle 30196**: The obstacle moving into the ego lane can result in a critical closeness due to relative speeds/positions.
- **No immediate collision detected** with others.
