At time 3.7 seconds, Obstacle 30193 is positioned in the front-left of the ego vehicle, maintaining a safe distance and moving away. Therefore, it poses a negligible risk.

Obstacle 30196, however, is very close to the ego vehicle's rear-right, at longitudinal -0.31 m and lateral -1.23 m. Its continuous approach towards the ego vehicle, both longitudinally and laterally, coupled with the short distance, indicates an extremely high risk of collision.  Given the close proximity (less than 0.5m) and the ongoing converging motion, this obstacle receives a risk score of 1 (Extreme Risk).

Obstacle 30197 is located at longitudinal -9.18 m and lateral -11.56 m relative to the ego vehicle's rear-right and is moving closer but not immediately so, thus representing a medium risk.  It receives a risk score of 3, meaning it is manageable with a proper and prompt reaction.
