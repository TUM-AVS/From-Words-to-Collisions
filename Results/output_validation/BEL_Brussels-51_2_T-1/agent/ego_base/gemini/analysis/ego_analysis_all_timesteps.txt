Obstacle 30193 is in the Front-left of the ego vehicle, moving away both longitudinally and laterally. It poses no immediate risk.

Obstacle 30196 is in the Rear-right, very close to the ego vehicle (-0.31m longitudinally, -1.23m laterally).  It is approaching rapidly from behind and laterally from the right. This represents a very high risk of collision.

Obstacle 30197 is in the Rear-right, further away than 30196, but still approaching from behind and laterally. While not as immediately dangerous as 30196, it still requires attention.

1: Extreme Risk - Immediate collision likely
2: High Risk - Close to collision, needs quick action
3: Medium Risk - Manageable with proper reaction
