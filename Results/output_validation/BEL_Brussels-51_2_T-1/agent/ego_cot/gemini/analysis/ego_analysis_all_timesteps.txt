### Safety analysis for timestep 3.7 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

**Calculations and Assumptions:**

* **Adjusted Distance:**  Since no vehicle dimensions are provided, I'll assume a safety buffer of 0.5 meters around each vehicle. Thus, `adjusted_d_long = |DTClong| - 0.5` and `adjusted_d_lat = |DTClat| - 0.5`. If the result is negative, it means a collision or extreme risk.
* **TTC:**  `TTC_long = adjusted_d_long / Vrel_long` and `TTC_lat = adjusted_d_lat / Vrel_lat`.  If `Vrel` is zero or moving away, TTC is considered infinite (no risk).

### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 30193**
    - Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is located front-left with `DTClong` of 3.65 m and `DTClat` of 3.65 m.  `adjusted_d_long` = 3.15 m and `adjusted_d_lat` = 3.15 m. This indicates a medium risk due to proximity.
    - Distance safety score: 3
    - Time Risk reason: Obstacle is moving away both longitudinally and laterally.
    - Time safety score: 5
    - Overall Risk score: 3

- **Obstacle ID: 30196**
    - Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is located rear-right, with `DTClong` of -0.31 m and `DTClat` of -0.31 m. `adjusted_d_long` = -0.81 m and `adjusted_d_lat` = -0.81 m. Negative adjusted distances signify extreme risk.
    - Distance safety score: 1
    - Time Risk reason: Obstacle is approaching rapidly from the rear-right; calculated TTC values would be negative and close to zero, indicating extreme risk.
    - Time safety score: 1
    - Overall Risk score: 1

- **Obstacle ID: 30197**
    - Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is located rear-right with `DTClong` of -9.18 m and `DTClat` of -9.18 m. `adjusted_d_long` = 8.68 m and `adjusted_d_lat` = 8.68 m. This distance presents low risk. However, its motion is towards the ego vehicle.
    - Distance safety score: 4
    - Time Risk reason: Though currently distant, the obstacle's motion towards the ego vehicle and its relative velocity indicate a potential future risk. With a safety buffer, the time to collision is above 3s, hence representing a medium risk.
    - Time safety score: 3
    - Overall Risk score: 3
