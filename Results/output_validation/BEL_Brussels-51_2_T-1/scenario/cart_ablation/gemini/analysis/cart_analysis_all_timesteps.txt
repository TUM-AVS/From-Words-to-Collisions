At t=3.9s, Ego is in lanelet 1747 with a velocity of 0.9048 and decelerating.

Obstacle 30193 is in lanelet 1748, moving at 4.949 and slightly decelerating.  Lateral separation is significant, and the trajectories don't appear to intersect in the near future. Risk score: 5.

Obstacle 30196 is in lanelet 1746, moving at 6.0587 and slightly accelerating. This obstacle poses the most significant risk.  While there is lateral separation now, obstacle 30196 has entered ego's lanelet at some point during the scenario.  The trajectories could intersect in the near future.  Furthermore, the large difference in speed between the ego (decelerating) and the obstacle (accelerating) makes a collision extremely likely if they end up occupying the same part of the lane. Risk score: 1 (Extreme Risk).

Obstacle 30197 is in lanelet 1682 with a velocity of 6.1707. Lateral separation from the ego is significant, and poses no immediate risk.  Risk score: 5.
