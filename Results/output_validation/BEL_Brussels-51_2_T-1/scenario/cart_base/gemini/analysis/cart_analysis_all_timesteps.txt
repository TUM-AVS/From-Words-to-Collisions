At t=3.9s, Ego (30195.0) is in lanelet 1747.0.

Obstacle 30193.0 is in lanelet 1748.0 at (242.7461, 48.9869).  While somewhat close laterally, the obstacle's and Ego's x-positions suggest a safe longitudinal separation and differing trajectories. This obstacle poses a Low risk (4).

Obstacle 30196.0 is in lanelet 1746.0 at (263.814, 38.54). This obstacle is approaching the ego vehicle from behind.  However, the y-position indicates it's in a different lane.  Combined with previous trajectory data suggesting continued separation, this is a Low Risk (4).


Obstacle 30197.0 is in lanelet 1682.0 at (275.3884, 31.3607).  Laterally distant from the Ego vehicle and x-positions indicate no immediate danger. This obstacle poses a Low Risk (4).

Therefore, no obstacle presents an Extreme (1) or Collision (0) risk at t=3.9s.
