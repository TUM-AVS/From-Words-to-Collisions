### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep (3.9 seconds):

### Obstacle Analysis:
1. **Obstacle ID: 30193.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Moving away from ego (X decreasing, Y increasing), lanelet 1748.0 is adjacent but not overlapping with ego's lanelet 1747.0.
   - **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: Velocity (4.949) is higher than ego's (0.9048), moving away.
   - **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low Risk)

2. **Obstacle ID: 30194.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Far ahead (X=289.36 vs ego's 261.50), lanelet 84.0 is distant.
   - **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: High velocity (7.9196) moving away.
   - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)

3. **Obstacle ID: 30196.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Close in X (263.814 vs ego's 261.50), same lanelet (1746.0) as ego's previous position.
   - **Distance safety score**: 2 (High Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: Velocity (6.0587) is higher than ego's, but trajectory diverging.

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. Ego is slowing down (velocity decreasing from 2.2942 to 0.9048 over 0.9 seconds).
2. Obstacle 30196.0 is the closest but diverging in trajectory (lanelet 1746.0 vs ego's 1747.0).
3. No obstacles are in direct collision path or overlapping lanelets with ego.
4. All obstacles are either moving away or at a safe distance.
