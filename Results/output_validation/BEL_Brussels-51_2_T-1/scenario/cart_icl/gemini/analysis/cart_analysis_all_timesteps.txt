### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 30193.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is in a different lane and relatively far from the ego vehicle.  History shows it consistently remains in its lane.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason:  Relative velocities and accelerations do not indicate a collision course based on historical data.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 30196.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is now in the same lane as ego, but still some distance away. History shows it changing lanes. Needs further monitoring.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Relative velocities and accelerations suggest the obstacle is slightly faster than the ego vehicle, potentially leading to closer proximity.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4


- Obstacle ID: 30197.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is in a different lane and far from the ego vehicle. History indicates it remains in a separate lane.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Relative velocities and accelerations show no immediate risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
No obstacle poses an immediate collision risk at the most recent timestep. Obstacle 30196.0 requires continued monitoring due to lane change and higher speed, though it currently maintains a safe distance. The scenario is not a collision scenario.


### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
  "CollisionObstacles": [],
  "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null,
  "ScenarioAnalysis": {
    "IsCollisionScenario": false,
    "Reasoning": "No obstacle presents an immediate collision risk in the most recent timestep. Obstacle 30196.0 warrants monitoring due to recent lane change and slightly higher velocity, but it maintains a safe distance currently."
