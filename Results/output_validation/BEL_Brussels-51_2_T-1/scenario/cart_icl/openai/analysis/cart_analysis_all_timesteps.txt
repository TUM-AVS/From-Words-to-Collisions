### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep:
Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 30193**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Located in lanelet 1748, which is a neighboring lanelet to the Ego vehicle's lanelet (1747), indicating that they are parallel but not sharing the same lanelet. Relative position change shows they are moving in a parallel path.
  - **Distance safety score**: 4
  - **Time Risk reason**: Consistent velocity, slight decrease in velocity, and acceleration indicating stable movement with no significant approach to the Ego vehicle over the last few timesteps.
  - **Time safety score**: 4
  - **Overall Risk score**: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 30196**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Located in lanelet 1746 at the most recent timestep, sharing lanelet with the Ego vehicle’s earlier trajectory (previous timestep), indicating potential merging scenario or crossing from neighboring path.
  - **Distance safety score**: 3
  - **Time Risk reason**: Velocity is higher than the Ego with variations in acceleration, suggesting potential convergence if the paths cross. Needs monitoring for potential collision due to shared trajectory.
  - **Time safety score**: 2
  - **Overall Risk score**: 3

- **Obstacle ID: 30197**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Continues on a trajectory in lanelet 1682, not directly interacting with the Ego vehicle's trajectory. Position change is lateral and does not suggest imminent intersection.
  - **Distance safety score**: 5
  - **Time Risk reason**: High and stable velocity, accelerations suggest it’s maintaining its course without significant deviations. No direct interaction foreseen.
  - **Time safety score**: 5
  - **Overall Risk score**: 5

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. **Identify Obstacle/Causal Factors**: Based on the recorded positions, Obstacle 30196 shares a lanelet with Ego at previous timesteps (potential path crossing).
2. **Trajectory Prediction**: The analysis of history suggests Obstacle 30196 might have potential merger or crossing opportunity with Ego, which warrants a medium risk but not an immediate collision.
3. **Verifying Collision Risks**: No obstacles demonstrate paths leading directly to the Ego, indicating potential collisions. However, obstacle 30196 requires monitoring.
4. **Criteria for Immediate Action**: Missing or low acceleration variations and consistent pathways for Ego and all obstacles imply no immediate collision, but close monitoring of Obstacle 30196 is needed.

    "CollisionObstacles": null,
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null,
    "ScenarioAnalysis": {
        "IsCollisionScenario": false,
        "Reasoning": "No obstacles have shared the same lane or projected paths with the Ego vehicle at the most recent timestep close enough to indicate immediate collision, though careful monitoring of Obstacle 30196 is advised."
