Obstacle 30193 is in the Front-left of the ego vehicle at a longitudinal distance of 0.99m and a lateral distance of 17.40m. It is moving away longitudinally at 1.13 m/s and laterally to the left at 4.51 m/s. While the lateral movement presents no immediate danger, the rapidly decreasing longitudinal distance suggests a potential collision risk if the ego vehicle continues its current trajectory. This obstacle warrants close monitoring and may require intervention if its longitudinal approach continues.

Obstacle 30196 is now directly to the right of the ego vehicle (0.00m longitudinal distance) and at a lateral distance of -0.88m. It is moving towards the ego vehicle laterally from the right at 5.57 m/s. This close proximity and lateral movement towards the ego vehicle represent a very high risk of collision.

Obstacle 30197 is located to the rear-right of the ego vehicle at a longitudinal distance of -6.21 m and a lateral distance of -12.75 m.  It's driving toward the ego vehicle from behind and laterally from the right, but the distances and relative velocities do not pose an immediate collision risk in this timestep. It warrants monitoring to ensure it doesn't become a higher risk.

Due to the close proximity and lateral movement of Obstacle 30196 towards the ego vehicle, there is an extreme risk of collision.
