### Obstacle Analysis

Let's analyze the situation at the most recent timestep: **3.9 seconds**.

#### Obstacle 30193
- **Position**: Front-left of the ego vehicle
- **Adjusted Distances**: Longitudinal 0.99 m, Lateral 17.40 m
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal 1.13 m/s, Lateral 4.51 m/s
- **TTC Calculation**:
  - **Longitudinal TTC**: Not applicable as this obstacle is moving away relative to the ego vehicle (positive relative velocity).
- **MDC Calculation**: Since the obstacle is moving away, the risk is primarily concerned with immediate distances:
  - MDC based on current adjusted distances: Longitudinal MDC is approximately 0.99 meters.

- **Risk Assessment**:
  - The obstacle is moving away longitudinally. The lateral distance is large, indicating low interaction risk on lateral movement.
  - **Risk Level**: Medium Risk (3), primarily due to the small longitudinal distance but confirmed by moving away.

#### Obstacle 30196
- **Position**: Right of the ego vehicle
- **Adjusted Distances**: Longitudinal 0.00 m, Lateral -0.88 m
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal 1.47 m/s, Lateral 5.57 m/s
- **Motion Description**: Exact longitudinal alignment, driving toward the ego laterally from the right.
- **TTC Calculation**:
  - **Lateral TTC** = 0.88 m / 5.57 m/s â‰ˆ 0.16 seconds
- **MDC Calculation**: Primarily focus on the lateral distance:
  - MDC = 0.88 meters.

- **Risk Assessment**:
  - Exact longitudinal alignment indicates possible high risk if the lateral distance is near zero with closing velocity.
  - The lateral TTC is below 0.5 seconds, indicating extreme risk.
  - **Risk Level**: Extreme Risk (1) due to low lateral TTC and closing velocity.

#### Obstacle 30197
- **Position**: Rear-right of the ego vehicle
- **Adjusted Distances**: Longitudinal -6.21 m, Lateral -12.75 m
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal 3.52 m/s, Lateral 4.30 m/s
- **TTC Calculation**:
  - Relative motion indicates approach, but the longitudinal position is behind.
- **Risk Assessment**: The obstacle remains at a distance and continues to approach but does not approach fast enough to cause an immediate risk.
  - **Risk Level**: No Risk (5) since it is still significantly behind in both dimensions.

### Conclusion
This scenario involves potential collision risk primarily from **Obstacle 30196**, as it presents an extreme risk with very low lateral TTC and proximity, indicating imminent crossing into the ego vehicle's path.
