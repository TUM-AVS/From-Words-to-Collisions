### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
    - Obstacle ID: 30193
    - Relative Direction: Front-left
    - Distance Risk Reason: DTClong is 0.99m, which is very close, representing a high risk longitudinally.  DTClat is 17.40m, far away laterally, therefore no lateral risk. The obstacle has been moving away longitudinally and further away laterally over the past several timesteps.
    - Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 2
    - Lateral Distance Safety Score: 5
    - Overall Distance Safety Score: 3.5  (2 * 0.5 + 5 * 0.5)
    - Time Risk Reason: TTClong is inf, meaning no longitudinal collision risk in terms of time. TTClat is also inf, showing no lateral risk over time. This is consistent with its motion of moving away.
    - Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 5
    - Lateral Time Safety Score: 5
    - Overall Time Safety Score: 5.0 (5 * 0.5 + 5 * 0.5)
    - Overall Risk Score: 4 (0.5 * 3.5 + 0.5 * 5 = 4.25, rounded to 4)

    - Obstacle ID: 30196
    - Relative Direction: Right
    - Distance Risk Reason: DTClong is 0.0m meaning an imminent longitudinal collision risk. DTClat is -0.88m which also means a very high lateral risk due to proximity. This obstacle has been progressively getting closer both longitudinally and laterally.
    - Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 0
    - Lateral Distance Safety Score: 1
    - Overall Distance Safety Score: 1.0 (0 * 0 + 1 * 1)
    - Time Risk Reason: TTClong is 0.0s indicating immediate longitudinal collision risk. TTClat is 0.16s, also indicating imminent lateral collision risk. The decreasing TTC values over previous timesteps confirm the approaching danger.
    - Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 0
    - Lateral Time Safety Score: 1
    - Overall Time Safety Score: 1.0 (0 * 0 + 1 * 1)
    - Overall Risk Score: 1 (0.5 * 1.0 + 0.5 * 1.0 = 1)

    - Obstacle ID: 30197
    - Relative Direction: Rear-right
    - Distance Risk Reason: DTClong is -6.21m and DTClat is -12.75m.  While at a safe distance currently, both longitudinally and laterally, the negative values indicate the obstacle is behind and to the right.  The magnitudes suggest a moderate distance. The obstacle's trajectory shows it has been approaching.
    - Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 5
    - Lateral Distance Safety Score: 5
    - Overall Distance Safety Score: 5.0 (5 * 0.5 + 5 * 0.5)
    - Time Risk Reason: TTClong is 1.76s, a medium risk level. TTClat is 2.97s, representing a lower risk laterally. While TTC values have been generally decreasing, they are not yet at extreme levels.
    - Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 3
    - Lateral Time Safety Score: 3
    - Overall Time Safety Score: 3.0 (3 * 0.5 + 3 * 0.5)
    - Overall Risk Score: 4 (0.5 * 5.0 + 0.5 * 3.0 = 4)
