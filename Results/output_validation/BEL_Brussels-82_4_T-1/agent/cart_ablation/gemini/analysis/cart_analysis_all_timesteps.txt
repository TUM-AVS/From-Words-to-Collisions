Analysis:

The ego vehicle is changing lanes from lanelet 122 to 1320.  While both obstacles 30231 and 30233 remain in lanelet 122, the ego vehicle's maneuver takes it away from these obstacles.  Although the obstacles are accelerating, the provided data suggests increasing separation between the ego vehicle and the obstacles over the observed time steps. Therefore, no immediate collision risk exists. Because the ego vehicle has moved to a different lanelet than the obstacles, there is no extreme or high risk either. No predicted extreme risk.
