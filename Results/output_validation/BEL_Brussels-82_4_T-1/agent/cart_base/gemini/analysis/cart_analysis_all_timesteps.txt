The ego vehicle is in lanelet 1320 while obstacles 30231 and 30233 are in lanelet 122.  While the provided data doesn't give lanelet geometry, the ego vehicle changes lanelets between timesteps 1.8 and 1.9, suggesting a lane change maneuver.  The obstacles remain in lanelet 122 throughout the scenario.

Analyzing the positions, both obstacles 30231 and 30233 are behind the ego vehicle initially. However, they are traveling at significantly higher speeds and accelerating faster than the ego vehicle. This closing velocity and acceleration difference over the short prediction horizon suggests a potential risk, but the data doesn't provide enough information to definitively determine the exact trajectories and lateral separation between the ego vehicle and the obstacles.  It's crucial to understand the lanelet geometry. If lanelet 1320 is ahead of 122 (e.g., after a lane change maneuver by the ego vehicle), the risk could be low. But if the lanelets are adjacent or if there's converging geometry, the risk could be higher.  The data lacks lateral distance information, which is critical for accurate risk assessment.

Given the ego vehicle's lane change and the significant speed differential, it's important to err on the side of caution.  Therefore, obstacle 30233, having the highest velocity and a higher initial position difference (closer to the ego vehicle), is assessed as a high risk (2). 30231 is also considered a high risk, due to its high closing velocity.
