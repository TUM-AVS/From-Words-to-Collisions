Obstacle 30231 and 30233 are in the same lane as the ego vehicle was initially. However, the ego vehicle has changed to a different lanelet (1320) from timestep 1.9 seconds onwards.  Therefore, the risk of collision has significantly decreased. Although obstacles 30231 and 30233 show increasing speed and acceleration, their trajectories do not intersect with the ego vehicle's new trajectory. Thus, they no longer pose an immediate threat.
