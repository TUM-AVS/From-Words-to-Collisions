### Analysis

At the latest timestep (2.7 seconds), we assess the situation of the ego vehicle in relation to the obstacles:

- **Ego Vehicle (30230.0):**  
  - Position: (-457.2153, 250.6434)
  - Velocity: 2.2235 m/s
  - Orientation: -0.6851 radians
  - Changing lanes: Positioned in lanelet 1320.0

- **Obstacle 30231.0:**  
  - Position: (-471.4385, 259.5068)
  - Velocity: 4.4979 m/s
  - Acceleration: 0.9026 m/s²
  - Located in lanelet 122.0, consistent accelerating trend

- **Obstacle 30233.0:**  
  - Position: (-461.7154, 253.6141)
  - Velocity: 5.4385 m/s
  - Acceleration: 1.9106 m/s²
  - Located in lanelet 122.0, has a consistently high velocity and acceleration

**Risk Assessment**  
Based on the positions and velocities of both obstacles relative to the ego vehicle, we consider two main factors for the risk evaluation:

1. **Obstacle 30231.0** has a significant margin from the ego vehicle (approximately 14 units of x and about 9 units of y), and given its higher speed and moderate acceleration, but the distance does not imply imminent collision. Hence it presents a **Medium Risk** score of 3.

2. **Obstacle 30233.0** represents a closer threat due to its nearing distance both in x and y directions relative to the ego vehicle and maintaining high velocity and acceleration. It poses a **High Risk** potential with a greater possibility to need urgent action, projecting closer proximity over time.

Given this, while no collision is inevitable (hence no scores of 0 or 1), obstacle 30233.0 is assessed at **High Risk** score of 2 due to the momentum and proximity factors.
