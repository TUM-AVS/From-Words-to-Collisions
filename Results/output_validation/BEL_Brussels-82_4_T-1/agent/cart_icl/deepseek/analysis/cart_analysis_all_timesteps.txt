### Analysis:

1. **Obstacle 30231**:
   - **Position**: (-471.4385, 259.5068) at 2.7s, moving towards ego.
   - **Relative Motion**: The obstacle is in the same lanelet (122.0) as ego was initially, but ego has moved to lanelet 1320.0. The lateral distance is increasing, but the longitudinal distance is closing.
   - **TTC**: The relative longitudinal velocity is ~2.27 m/s (4.4979 - 2.2235), and the distance is ~13.22 m (longitudinal). TTC ≈ 5.82s. 
   - **Risk**: Medium (3), as the lateral separation is increasing, and the TTC is manageable.

2. **Obstacle 30233**:
   - **Position**: (-461.7154, 253.6141) at 2.7s, moving towards ego.
   - **Relative Motion**: The obstacle is in the same lanelet (122.0) as ego was initially, but ego has moved to lanelet 1320.0. The lateral distance is increasing, but the longitudinal distance is closing rapidly.
   - **TTC**: The relative longitudinal velocity is ~3.215 m/s (5.4385 - 2.2235), and the distance is ~4.5 m (longitudinal). TTC ≈ 1.4s.
   - **Risk**: High (2), as the TTC is low, and the obstacle is accelerating rapidly (1.9106 m/s²).
