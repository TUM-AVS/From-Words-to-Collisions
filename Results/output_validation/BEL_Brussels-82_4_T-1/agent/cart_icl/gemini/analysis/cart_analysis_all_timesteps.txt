At t=2.7s, ego is in lanelet 1320 and moving with a velocity of 2.22 m/s. Obstacles 30231 and 30233 are in lanelet 122.  Let's analyze each obstacle:

**Obstacle 30231:** Located at (-471.44, 259.51) vs. ego at (-457.22, 250.64).  The obstacle is ahead and to the left of the ego vehicle, and moving faster. Given the different lanelets and the lateral separation, the risk is low.

**Obstacle 30233:** Located at (-461.72, 253.61) vs. ego at (-457.22, 250.64).  This obstacle is also ahead and slightly to the left of the ego, and moving significantly faster.  While the lanelet is different (122 vs 1320), the lateral separation isn't very large. This warrants further analysis, but since the ego vehicle has changed lanelets, the immediate risk appears low, especially considering the short time horizon of the provided data.  More data is needed for accurate long-term prediction.

Since no obstacles present extreme (1) or collision (0) risk, the JSON output will reflect this. The highest risk observed is likely a 3 (Medium Risk) for obstacle 30233 due to its relatively close proximity and higher speed, even though it's in a different lanelet. More data points would help firm up this assessment.
