At t=2.7 seconds, Obstacle 30231 is behind and to the right of the ego vehicle, at a longitudinal distance of -12.11 m and a lateral distance of -0.53 m.  While it's moving closer, it's still relatively far and poses no immediate threat. It is considered a low risk. Obstacle 30233, however, is directly behind the ego vehicle at a longitudinal distance of -0.86 m. This close proximity combined with the closing velocity makes this obstacle a high risk. The MDC is less than 1 meter and the TTC is likely less than 1s, making a collision possible without intervention.
