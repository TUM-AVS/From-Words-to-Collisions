At t=2.7s, Obstacle 30231 is located rear-right of the ego vehicle at a longitudinal distance of -12.11m and a small lateral distance of -0.53m. It is approaching the ego vehicle both longitudinally and laterally (from the right) with relative velocities of 2.23 m/s and 0.63 m/s, respectively. While the longitudinal distance is not immediately concerning, the continuous lateral movement towards the ego vehicle requires attention. Given the current dynamics, a collision is not imminent, but the situation calls for careful monitoring. I classify this obstacle as medium risk (risk score 3).


Obstacle 30233, on the other hand, is located directly behind the ego vehicle at a longitudinal distance of -0.86m. This extremely close proximity raises significant concern. Moreover, the obstacle is approaching the ego vehicle rapidly with a longitudinal relative velocity of 3.16 m/s. The short distance and relatively high closing speed suggest a likely collision if the ego vehicle brakes or decelerates suddenly, or if the following vehicle doesn't brake sufficiently. Therefore, I classify this obstacle as an extreme risk (risk score 1).


Risk Levels:
0: Collision - Physical contact occurred or unavoidable
1: Extreme Risk - Immediate collision likely
2: High Risk - Close to collision, needs quick action
3: Medium Risk - Manageable with proper reaction
4: Low Risk - Minimal risk, sufficient time to react
5: Negligible Risk - No significant risk
