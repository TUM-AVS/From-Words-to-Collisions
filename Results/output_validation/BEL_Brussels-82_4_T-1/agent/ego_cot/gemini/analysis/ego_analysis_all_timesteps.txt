### Safety analysis for timestep 2.7s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

**Assumptions and Clarifications:**

* Since "adjusted distances" are mentioned as critical but not provided in the context, I will perform the analysis using the provided longitudinal and lateral distances.  I will incorporate the concept of adjusted distances in my reasoning where applicable (e.g., assuming a safety buffer based on vehicle size). The lack of this data prevents precise TTC and MDC calculations.
* The context mentions "driving toward" even when distances are increasing. I will interpret this as relative motion indicating a decreasing distance or a general movement that *could* lead to a collision if trajectories continue, even if the current instantaneous velocity is slightly positive.  
*  I will use the last provided timestep (2.7 seconds) focusing on the most imminent risks, but will consider previous timesteps for trajectory prediction.

### Obstacle Analysis:

**- Obstacle ID: 30231**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is behind the ego vehicle at a longitudinal distance of -12.11m and lateral distance of -12.11m. While it appears far, the relative velocity suggests it is approaching. The diagonal movement (rear-right) also adds complexity.  Without adjusted distances and vehicle sizes, it's impossible to say with certainty how close it is in terms of safety buffers.
- Distance safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
- Time Risk reason:  Without precise relative velocity and adjusted distances, TTC cannot be calculated. However, the obstacle is moving towards the ego vehicle, so it needs to be monitored.
- Time safety score: 4 (Low Risk) based on current distance and assuming moderate relative velocity.
- Overall Risk score: 4 (Low Risk)


**- Obstacle ID: 30233**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is extremely close behind the ego vehicle. -0.86m longitudinally and -0.86m laterally puts it in a critical zone.  This is especially concerning given the relative velocities, suggesting a potential rear-end collision is imminent if trajectories continue.
- Distance safety score: 1 (Extreme Risk) -  The raw distance is very close, and even with a safety buffer considered, a high probability of collision risk exists.
- Time Risk reason: Again, precise TTC cannot be calculated without more data.  However, the very short distance combined with the relative velocity strongly suggests an imminent collision.
- Time safety score: 1 (Extreme Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 1 (Extreme Risk)
