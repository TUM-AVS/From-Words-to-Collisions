At t=2.7s:

**Obstacle 30231 (Rear-right):**

* Trajectory: This obstacle has been approaching from behind and slightly to the right.  The lateral movement has become more pronounced over the last few timesteps, increasing from -0.03m to -0.53m. The longitudinal distance is decreasing, indicating it's getting closer.
* Longitudinal Analysis:
    * Distance: -12.11m (negative indicates behind)
    * Relative Velocity: 1.61 m/s (positive means approaching)
    * TTC (Longitudinal) = Not applicable here. Negative distance.
* Lateral Analysis:
    * Distance: -0.53m (negative indicates to the right)
    * Relative Velocity: 0.63 m/s (positive means approaching from right side of ego)
    * TTC (Lateral) =  Not applicable here. Negative distance.
* MDC:  Approximately 12.11m.
* Risk Assessment: Due to large MDC, low risk (Risk Score 4).


**Obstacle 30233 (Behind):**

* Trajectory: This obstacle has been consistently approaching from directly behind, with a decreasing longitudinal distance in each timestep.  It appears to be on a near-collision course if the trend continues.
* Longitudinal Analysis:
    * Distance: -0.86m (negative indicates behind)
    * Relative Velocity: 3.16 m/s (positive, closing fast)
    * TTC = Not applicable here. Negative distance.
* Lateral Analysis:
    * Distance: 0.00m (directly behind)
    * Relative Velocity: 0.76 m/s (positive means closing laterally)
    * TTC (lateral) = Not applicable here. Zero distance.
* MDC: Approximately 0.86m.
* Risk Assessment: The MDC is less than 1.0m, combined with a high closing velocity, indicating Extreme risk (Risk Score 1).
