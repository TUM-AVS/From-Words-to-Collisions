At t=2.9s, Ego is at (-456.8809, 250.3498) in lanelet 1320. Obstacle 30231 is at (-470.6345, 259.0195) in lanelet 122, and Obstacle 30233 is at (-460.7417, 253.024) in lanelet 122.  While the provided data lacks information about the objects' sizes and shapes, the positions suggest a potential collision risk with Obstacle 30233. The positions of Ego and Obstacle 30233 are very close. Considering their respective velocities and accelerations, a collision is possible in the next few timesteps if they maintain their current trajectories. Although Obstacle 30231 is further away from the Ego than Obstacle 30233, its trajectory and accelerating behavior warrant attention. The overall situation appears risky and necessitates immediate action. More information is needed to conclusively classify the level of risk for Obstacle 30231.
