At t=2.9s, Ego is at (-456.88, 250.35) in lanelet 1320. Obstacle 30231 is at (-470.63, 259.02) in lanelet 122, and Obstacle 30233 is at (-460.74, 253.02) also in lanelet 122.  Both obstacles are relatively close to the ego vehicle.

Observing the trajectories, both obstacles are moving towards the ego's general area and increasing in velocity. While the provided data lacks information about lanelet geometry and vehicle sizes, the proximity and velocity trends, especially for Obstacle 30233, suggest a high risk of collision in the near future if the current trajectories continue.  Based purely on proximity at 2.9 seconds neither Obstacle is at risk score 0 or 1.
