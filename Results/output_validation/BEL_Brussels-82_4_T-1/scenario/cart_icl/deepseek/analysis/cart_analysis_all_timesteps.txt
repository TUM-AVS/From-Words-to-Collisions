### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep (2.9 seconds):

### Obstacle Analysis:

1. **Obstacle ID: 30231.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is in a different lanelet (122.0) compared to the ego vehicle (1320.0). Over the past timesteps, the distance between them has been decreasing but remains significant (~13.8m at 2.9s).
   - **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: The obstacle is moving faster (4.82 m/s) than the ego (2.24 m/s) but in a different lane. Relative velocity suggests no immediate collision course.
   - **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low Risk)

2. **Obstacle ID: 30232.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is in a different lanelet (1325.0) and moving away from the ego vehicle. Distance has been increasing over time (~72.1m at 2.9s).
   - **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: The obstacle is moving much faster (7.80 m/s) away from the ego. No collision risk.
   - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)

3. **Obstacle ID: 30233.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is in the same lanelet as 30231.0 (122.0) but closer to the ego (~3.8m at 2.9s). Distance has been decreasing over time.
   - **Distance safety score**: 2 (High Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: The obstacle is moving significantly faster (5.83 m/s) than the ego and is accelerating. TTC is decreasing.
   - **Time safety score**: 2 (High Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 2 (High Risk)

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. **Obstacle 30233.0** is the most concerning due to its proximity and increasing speed relative to the ego.
2. **Obstacle 30231.0** is in the same lane but further away and not on an immediate collision course.
3. **Obstacle 30232.0** is moving away and poses no risk.
4. No obstacles are currently in collision (score 0) or extreme risk (score 1), but **30233.0** requires monitoring.
