### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 30231.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is in a different lanelet and poses no immediate threat based on current positions and trajectories.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason:  Relative velocities and accelerations suggest no immediate collision risk given the different lanelets.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 30233.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is in a different lanelet and poses no immediate threat based on current positions and trajectories.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Relative velocities and accelerations suggest no immediate collision risk given the different lanelets.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5


### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. Identified two obstacles (30231.0 and 30233.0).
2. Both obstacles are in lanelet 122.0, while the ego vehicle is in lanelet 1320.0.
3. Based on their trajectories over the past 10 timesteps, they remain in separate lanelets, indicating no direct collision course.
4. Therefore, this is not a collision scenario.
