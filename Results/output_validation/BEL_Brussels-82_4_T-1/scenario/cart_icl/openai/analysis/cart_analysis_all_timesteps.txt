### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep:

#### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID**: 30231
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Obstacle 30231 is significantly separated from the Ego vehicle, positioned in a different lanelet and consistently moving on a parallel but non-converging path. Given their relative positions and orientations over time, the distance is increasing, thus posing minimal immediate collision risk.
  - **Distance safety score**: 5
  - **Time Risk reason**: The relative velocity of this obstacle shows a steady, substantial movement away from the Ego vehicle. Trends in both velocity and acceleration confirm a divergent trajectory from Ego, indicating minimal collision likelihood.
  - **Time safety score**: 5
  - **Overall Risk score**: 5

- **Obstacle ID**: 30233
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Similar to Obstacle 30231, Obstacle 30233 remains in a parallel lanelet, with no crossing trajectory observed. Distances from Ego showed consistent separation over the timeframes evaluated, indicating minimal collision threat.
  - **Distance safety score**: 5
  - **Time Risk reason**: Relative velocity demonstrates a divergent path from the Ego vehicle. The trajectory analysis over the past timesteps confirms that it continues to move away, minimizing any risk of collision.
  - **Time safety score**: 5
  - **Overall Risk score**: 5

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:

This is not a collision scenario based on the evaluated metrics. The positions and velocities of the obstacles indicate they are diverging from the Ego vehicle rather than converging. The historical data illustrates consistent separation in both position and velocity, leading to a straightforward conclusion that neither obstacle poses a collision threat.
