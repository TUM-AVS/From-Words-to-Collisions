Obstacle 30233 is at extreme risk of collision with the ego vehicle.  At the last timestep (2.9 seconds), it is only 0.14 meters behind the ego vehicle and closing at a high relative longitudinal velocity of 3.46 m/s.  Although some lateral movement is detected (0.00 lateral distance, 1.22 m/s relative lateral velocity), the primary risk is longitudinal. The very small longitudinal distance and the continuing approach of the obstacle towards the ego vehicle suggest a likely collision in the next timestep.

Obstacle 30231, while approaching, is further away longitudinally (-11.45m) and laterally (-1.51m) than 30233. Though it poses some risk, it's not as immediate as that of 30233.

    "IsCollisionScenario": false,
    "Reasoning": "Obstacle 30233 poses an extreme risk of collision in the next timestep due to its very close proximity (0.14m behind) and high closing velocity. While not a guaranteed collision at this timestep, it is extremely likely without immediate intervention. Obstacle 30231 also poses a risk, but it is not as imminent as 30233."
