Obstacle 30233 is very close to the ego vehicle, with a longitudinal distance of only -0.14 meters.  The relative velocity indicates it is approaching the ego vehicle rapidly. While lateral movement is increasing, the small longitudinal distance suggests a very high risk of collision in the next timestep.

Obstacle 30231 is further away longitudinally (-11.45m) but has moved laterally closer (-1.51m) than in previous timesteps and is moving towards the ego vehicle both longitudinally and laterally. While not an immediate collision risk like 30233, it requires attention.


**Risk Levels and Definitions:**
<Collision (Score: 0)>: Actual collision has occurred or is unavoidable within the next timestep.
<Extreme Risk (Score: 1)>: Immediate collision or very high likelihood of impact. Urgent action is required.
<High Risk (Score: 2)>: Close to collision or highly probable collision path. Needs prompt attention and quick manoeuvring.
<Medium Risk (Score: 3)>: Moderate collision risk but manageable with timely reactions and proper strategies.
<Low Risk (Score: 4)>: Minimal collision risk. The situation is controllable with sufficient time to react.
<Negligible Risk (Score: 5)>: No significant collision risk. Obstacles are either moving away or far enough not to interfere.
