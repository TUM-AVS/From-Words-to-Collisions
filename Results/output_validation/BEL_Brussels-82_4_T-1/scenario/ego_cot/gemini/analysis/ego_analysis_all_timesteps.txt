### Safety analysis for timestep 2.0s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 30231
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is relatively far behind the ego vehicle (-13.52m longitudinally).
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason:  Although approaching, the relative velocity and acceleration suggest ample time to react.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- Obstacle ID: 30233
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is very close behind the ego vehicle (-2.71m longitudinally).
- Distance safety score: 2
- Time Risk reason: The obstacle is approaching quickly, posing a high risk of collision.
- Time safety score: 2
- Overall Risk score: 2

### Safety analysis for timestep 2.1s:
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 30231
- Distance Risk reason: Still relatively far behind (-13.37m longitudinally).
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason:  Approaching, but not an immediate threat.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- Obstacle ID: 30233
- Distance Risk reason:  Obstacle is even closer now (-2.51m longitudinally).
- Distance safety score: 2
- Time Risk reason: The closing rate is increasing, elevating the risk.
- Time safety score: 2
- Overall Risk score: 2

### Safety analysis for timestep 2.2s to 2.8s: Similar analysis as above with progressively decreasing distances and TTC for Obstacle 30233, increasing the risk level. Obstacle 30231 remains a lower risk.  Detailed breakdown omitted for brevity but the same logic applies.


### Safety analysis for timestep 2.9s:
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 30231
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle at -11.45m longitudinal distance, not immediate risk but lateral movement needs to be considered.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Approaching, but not an immediate threat.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4


- Obstacle ID: 30233
- Distance Risk reason: Extremely close (-0.14m longitudinally).
- Distance safety score: 1
- Time Risk reason: Imminent collision likely.
- Time safety score: 1
- Overall Risk score: 1



### Summary in JSON Format:
