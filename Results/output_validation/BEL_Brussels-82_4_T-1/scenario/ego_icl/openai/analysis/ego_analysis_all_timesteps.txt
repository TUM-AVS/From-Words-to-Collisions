### Obstacle-by-Obstacle Analysis

#### Obstacle 30231:
- **Position at 2.9 seconds:** Rear-right
- **Adjusted Longitudinal Distance:** -11.45 m
- **Adjusted Lateral Distance:** -1.51 m
- **Relative Longitudinal Velocity:** 2.48 m/s (approaching)
- **Relative Lateral Velocity:** 1.01 m/s (approaching)
- **Motion Description:** Moving from the rear-right toward the ego vehicle laterally and longitudinally.

**Trajectory Analysis across Timesteps:**
- Starting from a farther position, this obstacle consistently reduces its longitudinal and lateral distance towards the ego car across the time intervals, indicating a steady approach.

**Time-to-Collision and Minimum Distance to Collision:**
- **TTC Longitudinal:** 11.45 m / 2.48 m/s ≈ 4.62 seconds
- **TTC Lateral:** 1.51 m / 1.01 m/s ≈ 1.50 seconds
- **MDC:** The smaller distance and calculated TTC indicate focus should be more on lateral distance due to its faster closeness.

**Risk Assessment:**
- **Longitudinal Risk:** Low risk due to TTC > 3.0 seconds
- **Lateral Risk:** Medium risk due to TTC < 3.0 seconds

Overall Risk for Obstacle 30231: **Medium Risk (3)**

#### Obstacle 30233:
- **Position at 2.9 seconds:** Behind
- **Adjusted Longitudinal Distance:** -0.14 m (almost touching)
- **Adjusted Lateral Distance:** 0.00 m (exact alignment)
- **Relative Longitudinal Velocity:** 3.46 m/s (approaching rapidly)
- **Relative Lateral Velocity:** 1.22 m/s 

**Trajectory Analysis across Timesteps:**
- This obstacle has reduced its longitudinal distance significantly and is extremely close, with longitudinal alignment maintained throughout.

**Time-to-Collision and Minimum Distance to Collision:**
- **TTC Longitudinal:** 0.14 m / 3.46 m/s ≈ 0.04 seconds (extremely low)
- **TTC Lateral:** Not applicable since lateral relative velocity is low
- **MDC:** Approximately 0.14 m due to the very short longitudinal distance.

**Risk Assessment:**
- **Longitudinal Risk:** Extreme risk due to TTC < 0.5 seconds and very close distance
- **Lateral Risk:** Not critical given the longitudinal imminent collision

Overall Risk for Obstacle 30233: **Extreme Risk (1)**

### Collision Scenario Determination
A collision scenario is identified due to the following reasons:
- **Obstacle 30233** has an Overall Risk Score of **1**, indicating an extreme risk situation with an almost-certain collision path due to minimal longitudinal clearance and rapid relative velocity.
