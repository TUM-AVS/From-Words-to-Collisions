### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
    - Obstacle ID: 30231
    - Relative Direction: Rear-right
    - Distance Risk Reason: The obstacle is behind the ego vehicle at a safe longitudinal distance (-11.45m > 5m) and moderate lateral distance (-1.51m, between 0.5 and 3). While it was initially moving straight behind, it started to laterally deviate from the last two timestamps toward the right.
    - Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 5
    - Lateral Distance Safety Score: 3
    - Overall Distance Safety Score: 4.0 (5 * 0.5 + 3 * 0.5 = 4.0)
    - Time Risk Reason: The obstacle is relatively far behind with TTClong of 4.62s, but the lateral TTC is around 1.5s, which could become extreme in following seconds since it laterally deviated significantly in the current timestamp compared to the previous. 
    - Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 4
    - Lateral Time Safety Score: 3
    - Overall Time Safety Score: 3.5 (4 * 0.5 + 3 * 0.5 = 3.5)
    - Overall Risk Score: 4 (0.5 * 4.0 + 0.5 * 3.5 = 3.75, rounded to 4)

    - Obstacle ID: 30233
    - Relative Direction: Behind
    - Distance Risk Reason: The obstacle is very close behind the ego vehicle at -0.14m longitudinally, posing an extreme risk. Lateral distance is 0.0m. Across all timestamps, this obstacle has been rapidly approaching from behind.
    - Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 1
    - Lateral Distance Safety Score: 5
    - Overall Distance Safety Score: 1.0 (1 * 1.0 + 5 * (1-1.0) = 1.0)
    - Time Risk Reason: TTClong is extremely low at 0.04s, indicating imminent collision, while TTClat is 0, meaning no lateral motion risk, also meaning no risk of collision by itself. Throughout all provided timestamps, it shows a trend of fast decreasing longitudinal time to collision.
    - Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 1
    - Lateral Time Safety Score: 5
    - Overall Time Safety Score: 1.0 (1 * 1.0 + 5 * (1-1.0) = 1.0)
    - Overall Risk Score: 1 (0.5 * 1.0 + 0.5 * 1.0 = 1.0)
