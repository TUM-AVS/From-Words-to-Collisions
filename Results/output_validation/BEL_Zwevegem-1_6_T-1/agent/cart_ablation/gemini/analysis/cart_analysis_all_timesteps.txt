Here's the collision risk analysis:

**Obstacle 333:** This obstacle shows a consistent trajectory in lanelet 38214, which is different from Ego's lanelet (39405). While the distance between the two decreases over the provided timestamps, the differing lane assignments and consistent trajectories suggest that a collision is unlikely.  The risk level is assessed as 4 (Low Risk) due to the decreasing distance but separate lanes. However, continued monitoring is necessary.

**Obstacle 315:** This obstacle also remains in a different lanelet than the Ego vehicle throughout the scenario. It initially appears in lanelet 39022, transitions to 39809, and remains there. Its trajectory and velocity don't indicate an immediate collision threat. The risk level for Obstacle 315 is deemed 5 (Negligible Risk) due to the lane separation and predictable movement.

**Obstacle 338:**  This obstacle appears at 2.1 seconds in lanelet 38214, the same lane as Obstacle 333 but further away from the Ego vehicle.  Given its trajectory and distance, it does not pose an immediate threat.  Risk level is 5 (Negligible Risk).


**Obstacle 317:** This obstacle appears at 2.5 seconds in lanelet 39022. Based on the limited data available, it doesn't present an immediate risk.  Risk level is 5 (Negligible Risk).
