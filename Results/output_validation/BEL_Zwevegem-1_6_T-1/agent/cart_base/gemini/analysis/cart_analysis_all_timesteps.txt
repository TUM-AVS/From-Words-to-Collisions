Obstacle 333: This obstacle is in a different lanelet (38214) than the ego vehicle (39405) for the entire duration. While its velocity is considerably higher than the ego vehicle's, the lateral separation suggests no immediate collision risk.  The distance between the two does decrease slightly over the timesteps but remains significant. This obstacle is deemed a Low Risk (4).

Obstacle 315: This obstacle is also in a different lanelet than the ego vehicle. Initially, it is in lanelet 39022 but transitions to 39809. While the positional data shows some proximity to the ego vehicle at 1.8 seconds, the subsequent positions and the differing lanelet IDs indicate no immediate collision risk.  This obstacle is deemed a Low Risk (4).

Obstacle 338: This obstacle appears at 2.1 seconds in lanelet 38214, the same lanelet as obstacle 333. Its velocity is relatively high, but the lateral separation and different lanelet from the ego vehicle suggest no immediate collision risk. This obstacle is deemed a Low Risk (4).

Obstacle 317: This obstacle appears at 2.5 seconds in lanelet 39022. While its velocity is higher than the ego's, its position and trajectory do not pose an immediate threat. This obstacle is deemed a Low Risk (4).
