Obstacle 333 shows a concerning trend. It's moving at a significantly higher speed than the ego vehicle and although not immediately colliding, the continuous high acceleration and velocity difference warrants attention. Further, obstacle 338 also poses a substantial risk with its increasing velocity, requiring careful monitoring. Other obstacles appear less risky in the immediate timeframe.
