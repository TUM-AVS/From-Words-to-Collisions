### Analysis for Risky Obstacles

At 2.6 seconds, the ego vehicle is at position (-548.2555, 477.5077), moving slower and with a deceleration trend over the timesteps. Comparing it with the obstacles:

1. **Obstacle 333.0**:
   - **Position**: (-542.71997, 481.0263)
   - **Velocity**: 11.980346
   - **Orientation**: -2.5483257
   - **Trend**: Consistently accelerating.
   - **Proximity**: Over the last few timesteps, the obstacle crossed lanes within close proximity of the ego vehicle and is advancing more quickly than the ego, significantly decreasing the distance.
   - **Risk**: The trajectory is towards the ego with closing positions, velocity vectors aligning in a way that makes collision imminent if there are no immediate evasive maneuvers.

2. **Obstacle 338.0**:
   - **Position**: (-525.76386, 492.27093)
   - **Velocity**: 8.9267254
   - **Orientation**: different lanelet but moving parallelly.
   - **Proximity**: While still relatively far, it is moving parallelly at a higher velocity. No immediate threat, but its path diverges from the ego path, needing occasional monitoring under certain circumstances.
   - **Risk**: It can be classified as medium risk given its trajectory and possible changes in orientation.

3. **Obstacle 315.0**:
   - **Position**: (-567.26713, 460.09355)
   - **Velocity**: 2.2369715
   - **Orientation**: 0.5229584
   - **Trend**: It is moving parallel but is located in a different lanelet. It shouldn't present an immediate threat.
   - **Risk**: Low to negligible risk due to speed, distance, and lane orientation.

4. **Obstacle 317.0**:
   - **Position**: (-571.14947, 459.73215)
   - **Velocity**: 3.323303
   - **Orientation**: 0.5090983
   - **Trend**: It is in the same north-south line as 315 and poses similar, non-threatening risks.
   - **Risk**: Low risk due to distance and motion perpendicular to ego.
