### Analysis:

1. **Obstacle 333**:  
   - **Position**: (-542.71997, 481.0263) at 2.6s  
   - **Velocity**: 11.980346 m/s (high speed, accelerating)  
   - **Relative Motion**: Moving towards ego from the front-left (similar orientation but higher speed).  
   - **TTC**: Estimated based on closing distance and relative velocity. The obstacle is moving faster than ego and is in a nearby lanelet (38214 vs. ego's 39405).  
   - **Risk**: High (2) due to proximity and high relative speed, but not imminent collision.  

2. **Obstacle 338**:  
   - **Position**: (-525.76386, 492.27093) at 2.6s  
   - **Velocity**: 8.9267254 m/s (moderate speed, accelerating)  
   - **Relative Motion**: Moving towards ego from the front-right (similar orientation but higher speed).  
   - **TTC**: Moderate, as the obstacle is not directly in ego's path but is in a nearby lanelet (38214).  
   - **Risk**: Medium (3) due to manageable distance and speed difference.  

3. **Obstacle 315**:  
   - **Position**: (-567.26713, 460.09355) at 2.6s  
   - **Velocity**: 2.2369715 m/s (low speed, accelerating slightly)  
   - **Relative Motion**: Moving away from ego (different lanelet, 39809).  
   - **Risk**: Low (4) as it poses no immediate threat.  

4. **Obstacle 317**:  
   - **Position**: (-571.14947, 459.73215) at 2.6s  
   - **Velocity**: 3.323303 m/s (low speed, accelerating slightly)  
   - **Relative Motion**: Moving away from ego (different lanelet, 39022).  
   - **Risk**: Low (4) as it poses no immediate threat.  

### Highest Risks:
- **Obstacle 333** is the most critical due to its high speed and proximity, but no collision is imminent.  
- No obstacles are at **Extreme Risk (1)** or **Collision (0)**.
