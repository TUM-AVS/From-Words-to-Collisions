At timestamp 2.6 seconds, there are several obstacles to consider. Let's analyze each one by the provided rubric:

**Obstacle 315:** Located 20.89m longitudinally and 2.83m laterally in the front-left.  The lateral distance suggests no immediate collision risk. The longitudinal velocity is negative, indicating it's moving towards the ego vehicle, but the distance is substantial. This obstacle poses negligible risk (5).

**Obstacle 317:** Located 24.35m longitudinally and 1.04m laterally in the front-left. Similar to Obstacle 315, the distance and lateral movement indicate negligible risk (5).

**Obstacle 333:** Located -2.05m longitudinally and 0.00m laterally behind the ego vehicle.  The negative longitudinal distance means it's very close behind and almost aligned laterally. The high positive longitudinal velocity (9.78 m/s) indicates it's rapidly approaching. This represents a very high risk of collision. Considering the MDC (around 0.5) and the closing speed this obstacle would be classified as high risk (2) and is very close to becoming extreme risk (1).

**Obstacle 338:** Located -22.39m longitudinally and 0.00m laterally, which means far behind the ego car with no lateral distance. The longitudinal velocity is 6.73m/s while approaching ego car. Since there is substantial distance, its overall risk level is low risk (4).
