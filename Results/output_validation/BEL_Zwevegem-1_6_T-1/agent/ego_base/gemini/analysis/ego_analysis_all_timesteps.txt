At t=2.6s, Obstacle 333 is very close to the ego vehicle, with a longitudinal distance of -2.05m. It has a high relative longitudinal velocity of 9.78 m/s and is approaching the ego vehicle. This implies a high risk of collision.

Obstacle 315 and 317 are in the front-left of the ego vehicle, and are moving away laterally while approaching longitudinally.  They are far enough away to not present an immediate danger.

Obstacle 338 is behind the ego vehicle and approaching, but it is relatively far away, so doesn't represent an immediate risk.



Risk Levels:
0: Collision - Physical contact occurred or unavoidable
1: Extreme Risk - Immediate collision likely
2: High Risk - Close to collision, needs quick action
3: Medium Risk - Manageable with proper reaction
4: Low Risk - Minimal risk, sufficient time to react
5: Negligible Risk - No significant risk
