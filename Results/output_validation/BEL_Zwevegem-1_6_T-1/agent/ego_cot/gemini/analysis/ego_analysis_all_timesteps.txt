### Safety analysis for timestep 2.6s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

**Assumptions and Clarifications:**

* Since adjusted distances (adjusted_d_long, adjusted_d_lat) are not provided in the scenario, raw distance values (DTClong, DTClat) will be used as approximations.  This might lead to slightly less precise risk assessments.  For a true autonomous driving system, having accurate adjusted distances is crucial.
*  I'll use a simplified TTC calculation based on constant velocity. A real system would use more sophisticated trajectory predictions. TTC = Distance / Relative Velocity.
*  The "exact lateral alignment or unknown case" for Obstacle 333 suggests a potential lateral collision risk if lateral movement is not accounted for.
* In the Summary JSON, we only report one obstacle each for the Extreme Risk and High Risk categories to follow the requested output format. If multiple qualify, we'd select the one posing the most immediate threat.


### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 315**
    - Distance Risk reason: Located 20.89m longitudinally and 20.89m laterally in the front-left.  Poses no immediate distance risk.
    - Distance safety score: 5
    - Time Risk reason: Moving away laterally and longitudinally at low relative velocities (-4.43 m/s, 0.1 m/s), implying a large TTC, thus no immediate risk.
    - Time safety score: 5
    - Overall Risk score: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 317**
    - Distance Risk reason: Located 24.35m longitudinally and 24.35m laterally in the front-left. Poses no immediate distance risk.
    - Distance safety score: 5
    - Time Risk reason: Moving away laterally and longitudinally at low relative velocities, indicating a low risk.
    - Time safety score: 5
    - Overall Risk score: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 333**
    - Distance Risk reason: Located -2.05m longitudinally and -2.05m laterally (behind and essentially aligned laterally).  Extremely close proximity indicates very high risk.
    - Distance safety score: 1
    - Time Risk reason: High longitudinal closing velocity (9.78 m/s) with close proximity implies very short TTC, indicating extreme risk.  
    - Time safety score: 1
    - Overall Risk score: 1

- **Obstacle ID: 338**
    - Distance Risk reason: Located -22.39m longitudinally and -22.39m laterally (behind). The distance is substantial, implying low risk.
    - Distance safety score: 5
    - Time Risk reason: Although approaching the ego vehicle from behind at a moderate speed, the distance is substantial. TTC will be reasonably long.
    - Time safety score: 4
    - Overall Risk score: 4
