### Analysis of Obstacles at the Most Recent Timestep (2.6 seconds)

#### Obstacle 315 (Front-left)
- **Position & Motion:** Currently at an adjusted longitudinal distance of 20.89 m and lateral distance of 2.83 m. The obstacle is moving toward the ego vehicle longitudinally with a velocity of -4.43 m/s, moving slightly away laterally.
- **Trajectory:** Longitudinal distance has been steadily decreasing, indicating a closing gap.
- **Velocity and Acceleration:** Continues to close the gap longitudinally. Lateral movement is minimal and increasing slightly.
- **TTC Calculation:**
  - Longitudinal: |20.89 m / 4.43 m/s| ≈ 4.72 seconds
- **MDC Calculation:**
  - Since it's mainly frontal offsetting laterally, MDC is ≈ longitudinal distance of 20.89 m
- **Risk Assessment:**
  - TTC suggests low risk considering sufficient time for reaction.
  - MDC supports this with a safe margin. 
  - **Risk Score:** 4 (Low Risk)

#### Obstacle 317 (Front-left)
- **Position & Motion:** Positioned at an adjusted longitudinal distance of 24.35 m and lateral distance of 1.04 m. Approaching longitudinally with a relatively stable lateral alignment.
- **Trajectory:** Decreasing longitudinal distance with a steady approach.
- **Velocity and Acceleration:** Moving toward the ego car with a longitudinal velocity of -5.51 m/s.
- **TTC Calculation:**
  - Longitudinal: |24.35 m / 5.51 m/s| ≈ 4.42 seconds
- **MDC Calculation:**
  - MDC ≈ longitudinal distance of 24.35 m
- **Risk Assessment:**
  - TTC and MDC suggest negligible risk since the time to react is ample.
  - **Risk Score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)

#### Obstacle 333 (Behind)
- **Position & Motion:** Adjusted longitudinal distance is -2.05 m and lateral 0.00 m, indicating it's directly behind but very close.
- **Trajectory:** Rapidly closing, previously recorded a trend of decreasing distance gap.
- **Velocity and Acceleration:** Approaching at 9.78 m/s.
- **TTC Calculation:**
  - Longitudinal: |-2.05 m / 9.78 m/s| ≈ 0.21 seconds (approaching zero distance rapidly)
- **MDC Calculation:**
  - MDC ≈ longitudinal distance (-2.05 m becomes minimal to zero rapidly)
- **Risk Assessment:**
  - Extremely low TTC and converging trajectory.
  - **Risk Score:** 1 (Extreme Risk)

#### Obstacle 338 (Behind)
- **Position & Motion:** At an adjusted longitudinal distance of -22.39 m, lateral 0.00 m.
- **Trajectory:** Decreasing distance gap as it's moving toward the ego car.
- **Velocity and Acceleration:** Approaching at 6.73 m/s.
- **TTC Calculation:**
  - Longitudinal: |-22.39 m / 6.73 m/s| ≈ 3.33 seconds.
- **MDC Calculation:**
  - No immediate convergence apart from decreasing longitudinal distance.
- **Risk Assessment:**
  - TTC indicates a medium level of risk due to significant time before a possible impact.
  - **Risk Score:** 3 (Medium Risk)
