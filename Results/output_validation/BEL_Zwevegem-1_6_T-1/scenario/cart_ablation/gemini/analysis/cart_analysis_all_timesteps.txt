At t=2.8s, Ego is at (-548.627, 477.2703) in lanelet 39405.0.

Obstacle 333 is at (-544.73711, 479.6677) in lanelet 39405.0, traveling at 12.3 m/s.  This obstacle shares the same lanelet as Ego and their positions are very close. Given the high velocity of Obstacle 333, a collision is imminent.

Obstacle 338 is at (-527.27982, 491.26758) in lanelet 38214.0. While this obstacle is in a different lanelet, its trajectory and speed (9.3 m/s) suggest a potential risk if Ego were to change lanes or if Obstacle 338's trajectory deviates.  However, at this immediate moment, it does not pose an *extreme* risk.

Obstacles 315 and 317 are in different lanelets and sufficiently far from Ego, posing no immediate threat.

Therefore, Obstacle 333 represents an extreme risk, bordering on collision.
