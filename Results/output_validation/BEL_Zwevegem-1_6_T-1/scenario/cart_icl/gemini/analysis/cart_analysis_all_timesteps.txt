### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 315.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is far from ego and in a different lanelet. No immediate risk observed in the provided timesteps.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason:  Relative velocities and accelerations do not indicate a likely collision in the near future.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 317.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is far from ego and in a different lanelet. No immediate risk observed in the provided timesteps.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Relative velocities and accelerations do not indicate a likely collision in the near future.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 333.0
- Distance Risk reason: Although the obstacle is in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle, it is moving considerably faster than the ego vehicle and pulling away. The distance between them increases over the timesteps.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: The relative velocity is high, but the direction of movement suggests divergence, and the distance is increasing.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- Obstacle ID: 338.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is in a different lanelet. No immediate risk observed in the provided timesteps.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason:  Relative velocities and accelerations do not indicate a likely collision in the near future.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5


### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
No obstacle has a risk score of 0, indicating no immediate collision.  No obstacle has a risk score of 1, indicating no extreme risk. The scenario is not a collision scenario.

### Summary in JSON Format:
