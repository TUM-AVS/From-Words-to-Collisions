### Obstacle Analysis:

#### Obstacle ID: 315.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: The distance between the ego vehicle and obstacle 315.0, initially quite large, has been decreasing very slightly due to the movement of both. Relative positions have not significantly converged, indicating an adequate spatial buffer.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: The relatively low velocity of obstacle 315.0 and its lanelet being different from the ego's provide minimal time risk. The acceleration trend is stable.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 317.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: Obstacle 317.0 is newly introduced and maintains a considerable distance. There's no converging trajectory towards the ego.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: Its higher velocity and different lanelet from the ego indicate minimal time risk of collision.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 333.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: This obstacle is located very close to the ego vehicle in the same lanelet at the final timestep, which is a high collision risk indicator.
- **Distance safety score**: 2
- **Time Risk reason**: A higher velocity and positive acceleration trend pose significant temporal risk for collision with the ego vehicle.
- **Time safety score**: 1
- **Overall Risk score**: 1

#### Obstacle ID: 338.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: Positioned further away but on a similar trajectory with no significant convergence towards the ego vehicle.
- **Distance safety score**: 4
- **Time Risk reason**: Its increased velocity combined with a stable trajectory away from the ego reduces immediate collision risk.
- **Time safety score**: 4
- **Overall Risk score**: 4

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. At 2.8 seconds, Obstacle 333.0 has approached near the ego vehicle in the same lanelet, presenting a high risk.
2. Considering its higher velocity and significant acceleration, Obstacle 333.0 has a consistent trajectory leading towards the ego.
3. Other obstacles are either stable in their positions or moving in different lanelets, reducing the immediate risk of collision.
