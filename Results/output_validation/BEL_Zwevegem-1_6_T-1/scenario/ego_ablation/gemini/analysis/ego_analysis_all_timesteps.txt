Obstacle 333 is extremely close to the ego vehicle, with a longitudinal distance of only -0.06 meters at the most recent timestep (2.8 seconds).  The negative sign indicates it is behind the ego vehicle. The relative longitudinal velocity is very high at 10.43 m/s, meaning it is closing in rapidly on the ego vehicle. Although relative acceleration is negative, indicating some deceleration, it's not sufficient to avoid a near-term collision given the proximity and velocity.
