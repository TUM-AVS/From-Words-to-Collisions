Obstacle 333 is very close to the ego vehicle at a longitudinal distance of -0.06m (behind the ego vehicle).  The high relative longitudinal velocity of 10.43 m/s indicates 333 is rapidly approaching/passing the ego vehicle from behind. While the lateral distance is 0.00 m, suggesting perfect alignment or an unknown lateral position, the increasing relative lateral velocity and the "Exact lateral alignment or unknown case" description raise concern about a potential lateral shift leading to a collision.

**Risk Levels and Definitions:**
<Collision (Score: 0)>: Actual collision has occurred or is unavoidable within the next timestep.
<Extreme Risk (Score: 1)>: Immediate collision or very high likelihood of impact. Urgent action is required.
<High Risk (Score: 2)>: Close to collision or highly probable collision path. Needs prompt attention and quick manoeuvring.
<Medium Risk (Score: 3)>: Moderate collision risk but manageable with timely reactions and proper strategies.
<Low Risk (Score: 4)>: Minimal collision risk. The situation is controllable with sufficient time to react.
<Negligible Risk (Score: 5)>: No significant collision risk. Obstacles are either moving away or far enough not to interfere.
