### Safety analysis for timestep 1.9s - 2.8s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

**Methodology:**

Given the data, directly calculating precise TTC is not feasible due to the non-constant velocities and accelerations. However, we can make conservative estimations by focusing on the current relative velocity and distance.  Since the lateral distances are significant for most obstacles and they are generally moving away laterally, the primary risk is longitudinal.

**Obstacle Analysis:**

* **Obstacle ID: 315**
    * Distance Risk reason:  Obstacle is relatively far from the ego vehicle and moving further away laterally.  Longitudinal approach is slow.
    * Distance safety score: 4
    * Time Risk reason: No immediate longitudinal collision risk.  
    * Time safety score: 4
    * Overall Risk score: 4

* **Obstacle ID: 317**
    * Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is relatively far from the ego vehicle and moving further away laterally. Longitudinal approach is slow.
    * Distance safety score: 4
    * Time Risk reason: No immediate longitudinal collision risk.
    * Time safety score: 4
    * Overall Risk score: 4

* **Obstacle ID: 333**
    * Distance Risk reason:  Obstacle is rapidly approaching the ego vehicle from behind. Longitudinal distance shrinks drastically over the time steps.
    * Distance safety score: 0
    * Time Risk reason: High probability of longitudinal collision based on the closing distance and velocity from behind. At 2.8 seconds, the distance is nearly zero and closing.
    * Time safety score: 0
    * Overall Risk score: 0

* **Obstacle ID: 338**
    * Distance Risk reason:  Obstacle is approaching from behind, but at a slower rate than 333.
    * Distance safety score: 3
    * Time Risk reason:  Moderate risk; while approaching, it's not as immediate as 333.
    * Time safety score: 3
    * Overall Risk score: 3


**Detailed Reasoning for Collision:**

Obstacle 333 exhibits a clear collision course.  At t=2.8s, the longitudinal distance is almost zero, and the relative velocity indicates continued closing.  The provided data strongly suggests a rear-end collision is imminent.  Obstacle 338 is also approaching from behind, however the collision with 333 occurs sooner, so 338 is no longer a concern here.  The remaining obstacle, 315 & 317, are both far ahead and to the left, demonstrating no immediate concern and are deemed low risk.
