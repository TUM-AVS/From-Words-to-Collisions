Let's analyze the obstacles for the most recent timestep (2.8 seconds) using adjusted distances to assess the risk levels and identify if there is a collision scenario.

### Analysis of Each Obstacle at Timestep 2.8 Seconds:

#### Obstacle 315:
- **Position**: Front-left
- **Adjusted Distances**: Longitudinal 20.00 m, Lateral 2.85 m
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal -4.20 m/s, Lateral 0.10 m/s
- **Analysis**:
  - The obstacle is moving toward the ego vehicle longitudinally, but moving away laterally.
  - **TTC_long** (Longitudinal): |20.00 / 4.20| ≈ 4.76 seconds
  - **TTC_lat** (Lateral): Not applicable (moving away)
  - **MDC**: Across widths, still safe due to small lateral changes.
  - **Risk Score**: 
    - **TTC** indicates a Low Risk (4) since it's more than 3 seconds and they are diverging laterally.
    - **MDC** indicates No Risk (5) due to enough lateral clearance.

#### Obstacle 317:
- **Position**: Front-left
- **Adjusted Distances**: Longitudinal 23.24 m, Lateral 1.08 m
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal -5.33 m/s, Lateral 0.19 m/s
- **Analysis**:
  - The obstacle is moving toward the ego vehicle longitudinally, but moving away laterally.
  - **TTC_long**: |23.24 / 5.33| ≈ 4.36 seconds
  - **TTC_lat**: Not applicable (moving away)
  - **MDC**: Still sufficiently far due to lateral movement.
  - **Risk Score**:
    - **TTC** indicates a Low Risk (4), considering distances and motion divergence.

#### Obstacle 333:
- **Position**: Behind
- **Adjusted Distances**: Longitudinal -0.06 m
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal 10.43 m/s
- **Analysis**:
  - This obstacle is longitudinally aligned behind the ego vehicle and converging.
  - **TTC**: |0.06 / 10.43| ≈ 0.006 seconds
  - **MDC**: Almost zero, potentially the ego vehicle moving away.
  - **Risk Score**:
    - **TTC** indicates a Collision (0) as they are extremely aligned and the velocity is very high.

#### Obstacle 338:
- **Position**: Behind
- **Adjusted Distances**: Longitudinal -21.02 m
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal 7.42 m/s
- **Analysis**:
  - The obstacle is moving toward the ego vehicle.
  - **TTC**: |21.02 / 7.42| ≈ 2.83 seconds
  - **MDC**: Far enough, not an immediate collision risk.
  - **Risk Score**:
    - **TTC** suggests Medium Risk (3).

### Conclusion:
Obstacle 333, based on its minimal distance and converging velocity, presents immediate collision circumstances with its risk score being 0 (Collision).

### JSON Summary:
```json
{
    "CollisionObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "333",
        "OverallRiskScore": "0"
    },
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "",
        "OverallRiskScore": ""
    },
    "IsCollisionScenario": true,
    "Justification": "Obstacle 333 exhibits immediate collision conditions due to its near-zero adjusted distance and very high converging velocity."
}
```

This identifies a collision scenario due to the potential collision condition with Obstacle 333.
