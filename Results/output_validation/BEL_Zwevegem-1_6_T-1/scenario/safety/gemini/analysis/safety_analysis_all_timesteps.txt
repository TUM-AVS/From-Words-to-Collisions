### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 315
- Relative Direction: Front-left
- Distance Risk Reason: DTClong = 20.00m, which is > 5, indicating negligible longitudinal risk. DTClat = 2.85m, which is between 1 and 3, indicating medium lateral risk. The obstacle is moving away laterally and towards the ego longitudinally.
- Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 5
- Lateral Distance Safety Score: 3
- Overall Distance Safety Score: 4.0 (5 * 0.5 + 3 * 0.5 = 4.0)
- Time Risk Reason: TTClong = 4.77s, which is > 5, indicating negligible longitudinal risk. TTClat = inf, indicating negligible lateral risk.  The TTClong has been relatively stable over the past few timesteps.
- Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 4
- Lateral Time Safety Score: 5
- Overall Time Safety Score: 4.5 (4 * 0.5 + 5 * 0.5 = 4.5)
- Overall Risk Score: 4 (0.5 * 4.0 + 0.5 * 4.5 = 4.25, rounded to 4)

- Obstacle ID: 317
- Relative Direction: Front-left
- Distance Risk Reason: DTClong = 23.24m which is > 5, indicating negligible longitudinal risk. DTClat = 1.08m which is between 0.5 and 1, indicating high lateral risk. The obstacle has been consistently moving closer longitudinally and slightly closer laterally over the timesteps.
- Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 5
- Lateral Distance Safety Score: 2
- Overall Distance Safety Score: 3.5 (5 * 0.5 + 2 * 0.5 = 3.5)
- Time Risk Reason: TTClong = 4.36s which is between 3 and 5, indicating low longitudinal risk. TTClat = inf, indicating negligible lateral risk. The TTClong has been decreasing slightly over the past timesteps.
- Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 4
- Lateral Time Safety Score: 5
- Overall Time Safety Score: 4.5 (4 * 0.5 + 5 * 0.5 = 4.5)
- Overall Risk Score: 4 (0.5 * 3.5 + 0.5 * 4.5 = 4)

- Obstacle ID: 333
- Relative Direction: Behind
- Distance Risk Reason: DTClong = -0.06m, which is close to 0, indicating imminent collision risk longitudinally. DTClat = 0.00m, which is close to 0 and may mean exact alignment or an unknown lateral position, this requires more investigation but doesn't contribute to the score as wdominant is 1.0.  The obstacle has been rapidly approaching the ego vehicle from behind.
- Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 1
- Lateral Distance Safety Score: 1
- Overall Distance Safety Score: 1.0 (1 * 1.0 + 1 * (1-1.0) = 1.0)
- Time Risk Reason: TTClong = 0.01s, which indicates imminent collision risk longitudinally. TTClat = 0.00, again either exact alignment or an unknown state, this requires attention but it's disregarded for risk calculation because of longitudinal dominance (wdominant=1.0). The TTClong has been rapidly decreasing, indicating high risk.
- Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 1
- Lateral Time Safety Score: 0
- Overall Time Safety Score: 1.0 (1 * 1.0 + 0 * (1-1.0) = 1.0)
- Overall Risk Score: 1 (0.5 * 1.0 + 0.5 * 1.0 = 1.0)

- Obstacle ID: 338
- Relative Direction: Behind
- Distance Risk Reason: DTClong = -21.02m which is < -5, indicating negligible longitudinal risk but the obstacle is behind the ego vehicle. DTClat = 0.00m, which likely means directly behind or unknown lateral position, but irrelevant due to the longitudinal dominance. The obstacle has been approaching longitudinally.
- Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 5
- Lateral Distance Safety Score: 1
- Overall Distance Safety Score: 5.0 (5 * 1.0 + 1 * 0.0 = 5.0)
- Time Risk Reason: TTClong = 2.83s which is between 1 and 3, indicating a medium longitudinal risk. TTClat = 0.00, which is either directly behind or unknown, irrelevant due to longitudinal dominance. TTClong has been steadily decreasing.
- Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 3
- Lateral Time Safety Score: 0
- Overall Time Safety Score: 3.0 (3 * 1.0 + 0 * (1-1.0) = 3.0)
- Overall Risk Score: 4 (0.5 * 5.0 + 0.5 * 3.0 = 4)
