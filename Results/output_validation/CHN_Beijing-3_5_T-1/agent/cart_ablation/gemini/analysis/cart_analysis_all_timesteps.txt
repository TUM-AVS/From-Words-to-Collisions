Here's the collision risk analysis:

**Ego Vehicle (3098):**  The ego vehicle maintains a consistent trajectory within lanelet 55. Its velocity decreases gradually over the provided timestamps.

**Obstacle 3094:** This obstacle is located in a different lanelet (67 and later in 64) and poses no immediate risk. Its high velocity indicates it's moving away from the ego vehicle. Risk score: 5

**Obstacle 3096:**  Located in lanelet 54, this obstacle is adjacent to the ego vehicle but maintains a safe lateral distance. The trajectories don't intersect. Risk score: 4

**Obstacle 3097:**  Located in lanelet 358, this obstacle is not in close proximity to the ego vehicle and poses no immediate risk. Risk score: 5

**Obstacle 3099:** Initially in lanelet 361 and then 63, this obstacle is distant from the ego vehicle and its trajectory does not intersect with the ego vehicle's path. Risk score: 5

**Obstacle 3100:** This obstacle is located in lanelet 370 and then 360. It poses no risk to the ego vehicle given its position and trajectory. Risk score: 5

**Obstacle 3101:** Stationary in lanelet 52. No risk. Risk score: 5

**Obstacle 3102:** In lanelet 54 and then lanelet 358, this obstacle is near the ego vehicle. However, the lateral separation is sufficient, and the trajectories don't intersect. Risk score: 4

**Obstacle 3103:** Located in lanelet 64. This obstacle is relatively far from the ego vehicle and doesn't pose an immediate risk. Risk score: 5

**Obstacle 3104:** Also in lanelet 64, this obstacle is far from the ego vehicle.  Risk score: 5

**Obstacle 3107:** This obstacle is in the same lanelet (55) as the ego vehicle. However, it maintains its trajectory behind the ego vehicle throughout the scenario, with a safe following distance and decreasing velocity. Risk score: 4 - It could become a medium risk depending on future changes in velocity.
