Obstacle 3094: This obstacle is located in lanelet 67, which seems to be separate from the ego vehicle's lanelet (55). While its velocity is high and increasing, its position remains relatively far from the ego vehicle throughout the provided timesteps, suggesting no immediate collision risk.  Risk Score: 5

Obstacle 3096: This obstacle is in lanelet 54, adjacent to the ego vehicle's lanelet (55). Its position is relatively close, but it maintains a safe distance and its velocity and acceleration do not indicate an immediate collision threat. Risk Score: 4

Obstacle 3097:  Located in lanelet 358 and later 358, this obstacle is spatially separated from the ego vehicle and poses no collision risk. Risk Score: 5

Obstacle 3099: This obstacle starts in lanelet 361 and transitions to lanelet 63.  Its trajectory doesn't intersect with the ego vehicle's path, and its movement doesn't pose a direct threat. Risk Score: 5

Obstacle 3100: Located in lanelet 370 and later 360, this obstacle remains far from the ego vehicle's path. Risk Score: 5

Obstacle 3101: This stationary obstacle in lanelet 52 poses no risk to the ego vehicle in lanelet 55. Risk Score: 5

Obstacle 3102: This obstacle is in lanelet 54 and later 358, getting closer to the ego vehicle. However, it does not represent an immediate collision risk based on their current trajectories. Risk Score: 4


Obstacle 3103: This obstacle is in lanelet 64, consistently far from the ego vehicle's lanelet (55).  It shows no collision risk. Risk Score: 5

Obstacle 3104: This obstacle in lanelet 64 is far from the ego vehicle and shows no collision risk. Risk Score: 5

Obstacle 3107: This obstacle is in the same lanelet (55) as the ego vehicle.  Critically, its position and velocity indicate a possible collision risk as it slows down significantly. Though the distance isn't critically close yet, the trends in their movement suggest a potential collision in the near future. Risk Score: 3, approaching 2
