Obstacle 3107 is showing a concerning trend. While not immediately colliding, its lanelet (55) matches the ego vehicle's, and both are moving in the same general direction. However, the ego vehicle is decelerating significantly more than obstacle 3107, which increases the risk of a rear-end collision in the near future. Additionally, Obstacle 3101 is static and in the ego vehicle's lane. Given the ego vehicle's current deceleration, this poses a medium risk of collision in the coming timesteps if no evasive action is taken.
