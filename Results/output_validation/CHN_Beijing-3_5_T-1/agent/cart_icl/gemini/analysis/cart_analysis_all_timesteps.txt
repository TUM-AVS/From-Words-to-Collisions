At t=9.0s, Obstacle 3107 is in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle and its longitudinal velocity is decreasing while the ego vehicle's velocity is also decreasing but at a slower rate and a smaller absolute value. The relative distance between the two is decreasing, indicating a potential collision risk. Although there is some lateral distance between the two vehicles, it is not enough to confidently rule out a collision if both maintain their current trajectories. Thus, there is a medium risk. Other vehicles are either far away from the ego vehicle or have a large lateral distance, posing lower risks.  Obstacle 3101 is stationary and poses no risk. Obstacle 3103 has negligible velocity hence poses no risk.
