Based on the latest timestep (9.0 seconds), let's analyze the scenario for any potential risks:

1. **Obstacle 3096:**
   - **Position:** (293.1544, 483.2251)
   - **Velocity:** 5.2794 m/s
   - **Lanelet:** 54.0
   - **Distance to Ego:** Approximately 12.7 meters away from the Ego's current position.
   - Current trajectory and trend from past data indicate it is moving away from the ego position. **Risk:** 5 (Negligible Risk)

2. **Obstacle 3099:**
   - **Position:** (265.9328, 499.4304)
   - **Velocity:** 8.436 m/s
   - **Lanelet:** 63.0
   - **Distance to Ego:** Approximately 21.6 meters away. The obstacle's trajectory indicates it moves along a different lane, maintaining a relatively parallel course to the ego. **Risk:** 4 (Low Risk)

3. **Obstacle 3100:**
   - **Position:** (265.6422, 485.7145)
   - **Velocity:** 3.9436 m/s
   - **Lanelet:** 360.0
   - **Distance to Ego:** Approximately 14.2 meters away. Although its velocity is increasing, its path does not directly intersect with the ego vehicle. **Risk:** 4 (Low Risk)

4. **Obstacle 3101:**
   - **Position:** (306.4093, 496.4309)
   - **Velocity:** 0.0 m/s
   - **Lanelet:** 52.0
   - **Distance to Ego:** This stationary obstacle remains distant from the ego's trajectory. **Risk:** 5 (Negligible Risk)

5. **Obstacle 3103:**
   - **Position:** (262.4684, 495.4904)
   - **Velocity:** 0.0 m/s
   - **Lanelet:** 64.0
   - **Proximity:** In close proximity but stationary now. It had a deceleration phase, but has ceased motion now. **Risk:** 2 (High Risk)

6. **Obstacle 3107:**
   - **Position:** (284.5232, 486.553)
   - **Velocity:** 3.1832 m/s
   - **Lanelet:** 55.0 (same lanelet as the ego)
   - **Distance to Ego:** This obstacle is in the same lanelet, slightly ahead of the ego, with a continual deceleration observed. The potential for rear collision due to reduced velocity is noted. **Risk:** 2 (High Risk)

After evaluating potential risks, the obstacles with significant risks are 3103 and 3107, both categorized as "High Risk" due to proximity and reduced velocities.
