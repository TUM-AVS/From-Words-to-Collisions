At timestamp 9.0s, the following obstacles warrant attention:

**Obstacle 3107 (Behind):** This obstacle is the most critical.  It's only 0.56 meters behind the ego vehicle and closing at 2.34 m/s. This translates to a very short TTC, placing this obstacle in an Extreme Risk or even potential collision state.  Given the data provided, precise TTC calculation is difficult, but it's undeniably below the 1-second threshold, potentially even below 0.5 seconds, placing it at risk level 1 or even 0.

**Obstacle 3100 (Front):**  At 9.32 meters ahead longitudinally, the MDC is currently manageable.  However, the lateral velocity component suggests it may be cutting in front of the ego vehicle. Closer monitoring is required, though the current snapshot classifies this as a Medium Risk (Risk level 3) at best if we only look at the longitudinal.

**Other Obstacles:** The remaining obstacles are moving away from the ego vehicle longitudinally or are at a safe lateral and longitudinal distance, posing no immediate threat.
