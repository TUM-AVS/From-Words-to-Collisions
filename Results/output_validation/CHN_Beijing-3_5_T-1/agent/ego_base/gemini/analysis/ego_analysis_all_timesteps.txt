At timestamp 9.0 seconds, the following obstacles are present:

* **Obstacle 3096:** Located rear-left, moving away longitudinally and laterally. This poses a negligible risk (5).
* **Obstacle 3099:** Located front-right, driving towards the ego car longitudinally but moving away laterally.  Medium risk (3) due to the lateral movement.
* **Obstacle 3100:** Located in front, driving towards the ego car longitudinally. Lateral velocity is positive, meaning it's moving to the right, but since lateral distance is zero, this might be attributed to noise or an unknown case.  High risk (2) due to the closing longitudinal distance.
* **Obstacle 3101:** Located rear-right, moving away longitudinally and with no lateral movement.  Negligible risk (5).
* **Obstacle 3102:** Located rear-left, moving away longitudinally but driving towards the ego car laterally. Medium risk (3) due to the lateral movement.
* **Obstacle 3103:** Located front-right with a longitudinal distance of 12.26 m and almost no lateral movement.  Medium risk (3) because it is closing longitudinally.
* **Obstacle 3104:** Located front-right, driving toward the ego car both longitudinally and laterally. Medium Risk (3).
* **Obstacle 3107:** Located behind, driving towards the ego car longitudinally and laterally aligned.  High risk (2) due to the close proximity and closing longitudinal distance.

Risk Levels:
0: Collision - Physical contact occurred or unavoidable
1: Extreme Risk - Immediate collision likely
2: High Risk - Close to collision, needs quick action
3: Medium Risk - Manageable with proper reaction
4: Low Risk - Minimal risk, sufficient time to react
5: Negligible Risk - No significant risk
