### Safety analysis for timestep 9.0s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

**Assumptions and Clarifications:**

* The provided scenario lacks ego vehicle dimensions and obstacle dimensions.  Therefore, I cannot calculate adjusted distances (adjusted_d_long, adjusted_d_lat) as instructed. I will use the provided real distances (DTClong, DTClat) for this analysis, but please note this may not accurately reflect real-world collision risk.  Providing vehicle dimensions is crucial for accurate TTC and MDC calculations.
* I'm assuming a rectangular bounding box for vehicles when considering lateral distance. In a real-world scenario, more complex shapes would be used.
* I'm assuming that "Exact lateral alignment or unknown case" means the lateral relative velocity is close to zero or unknown. This impacts TTClat estimations.

**General Observations:**

Several vehicles are in motion relative to the ego vehicle. Obstacle 3107 poses the highest risk, quickly approaching from behind. Obstacle 3100 is also approaching the ego vehicle from the front while laterally moving towards the ego vehicle's path from the right.  Other obstacles are at safer distances and have diverging trajectories, suggesting lower risk.
