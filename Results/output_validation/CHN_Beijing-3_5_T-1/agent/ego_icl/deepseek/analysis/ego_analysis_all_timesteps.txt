Let me analyze each obstacle at the most recent timestep (9.0 seconds) with trajectory context from previous timesteps:

1. Obstacle 3096 (Rear-left):
- Longitudinal: -9.11m (moving away at -6.12m/s)
- Lateral: 1.94m (moving away at 0.02m/s)
- Analysis: Both distances increasing, no collision risk
- Risk: 5 (No Risk)

2. Obstacle 3099 (Front-right):
- Longitudinal: 8.71m (approaching at -0.74m/s)
- Lateral: -11.68m (moving away at -8.44m/s)
- Analysis: Moving away diagonally, no collision risk
- Risk: 5 (No Risk)

3. Obstacle 3100 (Front):
- Longitudinal: 9.32m (approaching at -3.61m/s → TTC = 2.58s)
- Lateral: 0.00m (exact alignment)
- Analysis: Approaching frontally but with sufficient distance/time
- Risk: 3 (Medium Risk)

4. Obstacle 3101 (Rear-right):
- Longitudinal: -22.67m (moving away at -0.84m/s)
- Lateral: -7.73m (stationary)
- Analysis: Moving away, no risk
- Risk: 5 (No Risk)

5. Obstacle 3102 (Rear-left):
- Longitudinal: -20.82m (moving away at -6.39m/s)
- Lateral: 0.84m (approaching at -2.52m/s)
- Analysis: Moving away longitudinally despite lateral approach
- Risk: 5 (No Risk)

6. Obstacle 3103 (Front-right):
- Longitudinal: 12.26m (approaching at -0.84m/s)
- Lateral: -7.83m (stationary)
- Analysis: Slow approach with large distance
- Risk: 5 (No Risk)

7. Obstacle 3104 (Front-right):
- Longitudinal: 12.23m (approaching at -0.84m/s)
- Lateral: -16.43m (approaching at 1.07m/s)
- Analysis: Very slow approach with large distances
- Risk: 5 (No Risk)

8. Obstacle 3107 (Behind):
- Longitudinal: -0.56m (approaching at 2.34m/s → TTC = 0.24s)
- Lateral: 0.00m (exact alignment)
- Analysis: Rapid rear approach with extremely small distance
- Risk: 0 (Collision Risk)

Trajectory Analysis:
- Obstacle 3107 shows consistent rear approach from -2.86m at 8.1s to -0.56m at 9.0s
- Closing speed remains high (2.34m/s at last timestep)
- Will collide with ego within next 0.24 seconds if trajectories continue
