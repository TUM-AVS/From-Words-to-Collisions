At t=9.2s, Ego (3098.0) is at (279.2883, 486.4486) in lanelet 55.0.  Let's analyze the closest obstacles:

* **Obstacle 3096.0:** Located at (294.2429, 483.2472) in lanelet 54.0.  While this obstacle is in the adjacent lane and relatively close, its trajectory shows it moving further away from the ego vehicle.  Risk score: 4 (Low Risk).

* **Obstacle 3107.0:** Located at (283.9388, 486.5415) in lanelet 55.0. This obstacle is in the same lane as the ego vehicle and quite close.  The trajectories suggest a possible collision if the ego vehicle continues to decelerate while this obstacle maintains its current velocity. Risk score: 2 (High Risk).

* **Obstacle 3101.0:** Stationary obstacle at (306.4093, 496.4309) in lanelet 52.0. This obstacle is a moderate distance from the ego vehicle and not on a collision course. Risk Score: 4 (Low Risk)

* **Obstacle 3102.0:** At (305.8486, 485.2283) in lanelet 362.0. Although its getting closer to the ego vehicle, the obstacle is not an immediate threat due to the spatial separation. Risk Score: 3 (Medium Risk).

No obstacle presents an extreme or collision risk (score 0 or 1) at this time step.
