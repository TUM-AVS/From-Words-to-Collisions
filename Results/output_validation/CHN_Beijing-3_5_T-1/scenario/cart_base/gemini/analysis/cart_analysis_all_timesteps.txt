Obstacle 3107 is in the same lane as the Ego vehicle and its position is rapidly approaching the Ego vehicle's position.  Given their current velocities and accelerations, a collision is likely within the next few timesteps. Obstacle 3096 is also approaching Ego laterally and should be monitored, but it presents less immediate risk than 3107. Other obstacles are not a concern in the immediate future.

        "Reasoning": "Obstacle 3107 poses an extreme risk due to its proximity, velocity, and acceleration relative to the Ego vehicle in the same lanelet.  A collision is highly likely if immediate action isn't taken."
