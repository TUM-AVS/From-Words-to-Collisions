### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 3096.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 3096.0 is in a different lanelet (54.0) than the ego vehicle (55.0). While its Y-coordinate is close to the ego vehicle, its X-coordinate shows lateral separation and its trajectory over the past timesteps indicates it is moving further away laterally.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: The obstacle has a higher velocity than the ego vehicle, but the trajectories suggest they are not converging longitudinally.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- Obstacle ID: 3099.0
- Distance Risk reason: This obstacle is in a different lanelet and considerably behind the ego vehicle, with a safe lateral distance based on its trajectory history.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Though moving faster than the ego vehicle, its trajectory history suggests it poses no immediate threat.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 3100.0
- Distance Risk reason: Located in a different lanelet and further behind than obstacle 3099.0, it presents no immediate risk.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: No time-based risk given its position and trajectory.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 3101.0
- Distance Risk reason: Located in a different lanelet and ahead of the ego vehicle, but with a safe lateral separation based on the provided data. Its stationary state over the observed period further reduces risk.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: The obstacle is stationary, posing no immediate time-related risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 4

- Obstacle ID: 3102.0
- Distance Risk reason: Located in a different lanelet and ahead of the ego vehicle, but with a constantly growing lateral separation, making a collision highly unlikely based on the current trajectories.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason:  The obstacle is moving faster than the ego vehicle but away and laterally so poses no immediate risk.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- Obstacle ID: 3103.0
- Distance Risk reason: Located far behind and in a different lanelet, posing no immediate risk based on current positions and trajectory history.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason:  Although initially moving faster, its velocity has decreased significantly over the past timesteps, further mitigating any time-related risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 3104.0
- Distance Risk reason: Located behind and in a different lanelet, exhibiting a safe lateral distance based on its trajectory history.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: No immediate time-related risk due to its position and decreasing velocity.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 3107.0
- Distance Risk reason: This obstacle is in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle and is getting increasingly close based on positions from past timesteps. It poses a substantial distance-based risk.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: The obstacle's velocity, although higher than the ego's, is decreasing and the ego is also decelerating, hence there is a low risk.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3


### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. **Most critical obstacle:** Obstacle 3107.0 is the most critical as it's in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle (55.0) and its distance is consistently decreasing longitudinally and laterally (although it is still far) over each timestep.
2. **Trajectory analysis:**  Both the ego vehicle and obstacle 3107.0 are moving in the same general direction along lanelet 55.0, but obstacle 3107.0 shows clear intent for convergence towards ego over time, although it is still not dangerously close.
3. **Relative position, velocity, and acceleration:** Obstacle 3107.0 is behind the ego vehicle. While the obstacle is still moving faster, both are decelerating.  The rate of deceleration needs careful monitoring over future timesteps.
4. **Collision determination:** Based on the current data, a collision hasn't occurred. While 3107 shows an obvious sign of proximity to the ego vehicle and is the most dangerous obstacle, it still does not impose an imminent collision risk due to the braking of both. Further observation is needed to conclusively determine future safety.
5. **Reasoning:** Although the distance between the ego vehicle and obstacle 3107.0 is decreasing, the risk evaluation is based on the current positions and recent trajectory. Future prediction is out of scope of this analysis based on explicit instructions in the prompt.

### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
  "CollisionObstacles": null,
  "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null,
  "ScenarioAnalysis": {
    "IsCollisionScenario": false,
    "Reasoning": "No collision has occurred. Obstacle 3107.0 poses the most significant risk due to its decreasing distance to the ego vehicle in the same lanelet, however, based on the most recent data, the risk is only at medium level. Further observation and analysis of future timesteps are needed to determine the possibility of an actual collision."
