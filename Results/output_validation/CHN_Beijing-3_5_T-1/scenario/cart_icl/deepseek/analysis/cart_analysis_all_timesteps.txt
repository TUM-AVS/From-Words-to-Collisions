### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. Ego is moving slowly (0.88 m/s) in lanelet 55.0
2. Only obstacle 3107.0 is in same lanelet and approaching from rear
3. Relative speed is ~1.92 m/s with ~4.6m distance â†’ TTC ~2.4s (medium risk)
4. All other obstacles are either static, in different lanes, or moving away
5. No immediate collision risk, but rear approach requires monitoring
