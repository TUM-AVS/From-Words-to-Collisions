### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 3096.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is in a different lane and moderately far from the ego vehicle.  Trajectory suggests it will remain separate.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason:  Relative velocities suggest no immediate danger, but continued monitoring needed.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- Obstacle ID: 3097.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is in a different lane and poses minimal risk based on trajectory.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Sufficient separation in terms of velocity and projected path.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 3099.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is spatially separated and moving away from ego's trajectory.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Diverging paths and velocities indicate negligible risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 3100.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is positioned laterally away from ego and trajectory shows no convergence.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason:  Relative velocities and directions mitigate any immediate risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 3101.0
- Distance Risk reason:  Laterally separated and stationary, not posing an immediate threat based on distance.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Static obstacle poses no time-related risk currently.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 4

- Obstacle ID: 3102.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle in a different lane and sufficiently separated laterally. Trajectory suggests it will remain so.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason:  Relative velocities are safe given the lateral separation.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4


- Obstacle ID: 3103.0
- Distance Risk reason:  Laterally separated and trajectory indicates no immediate convergence.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Minimal velocity and deceleration further decrease any potential risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5


- Obstacle ID: 3104.0
- Distance Risk reason: Laterally separated and trajectory indicates no immediate risk.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Low velocity and deceleration suggest no imminent collision risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5


- Obstacle ID: 3107.0
- Distance Risk reason:  In the same lane but maintaining a safe following distance.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Relative velocities and deceleration are safe within the current following distance.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4


### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
No obstacles pose an immediate collision risk.  All obstacles are either in different lanes, maintaining safe distances, or moving in directions that diverge from the ego vehicle's path. The scenario is not a collision scenario.
