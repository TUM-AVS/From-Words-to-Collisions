### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep:
Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

#### Obstacle ID: 3096
- **Distance Risk reason**: Obstacle 3096 is located slightly ahead of the ego vehicle to its right, maintaining a safe lateral distance over all timesteps.
- **Distance safety score**: 4
- **Time Risk reason**: The velocity and acceleration trends do not indicate potential crossing into the ego's path.
- **Time safety score**: 4
- **Overall Risk score**: 4

#### Obstacle ID: 3099
- **Distance Risk reason**: Positioned further ahead on a different trajectory with increasing northbound movement.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: Rapidly moving away, and not aligned with ego's direction.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 3100
- **Distance Risk reason**: Positioned left and slightly behind with a diverging trajectory.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: Increased velocity and generally moving away.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 3101
- **Distance Risk reason**: Stationary and well-off the ego vehicle's trajectory.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: No movement means no time-related collision risk.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 3102
- **Distance Risk reason**: Situated further ahead and only moderately moving without crossing trajectory.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: Consistent lateral positioning and velocity away from ego's path.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 3103
- **Distance Risk reason**: Located to the far left with reducing velocity and diminishing threat.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: Continual deceleration poses no imminent time-related collision risk.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 3104
- **Distance Risk reason**: Stationary trend with maintained lateral clearance.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: Very slow speed and minimal lateral movement pose negligible risk.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 3107
- **Distance Risk reason**: Located slightly rear and right, with no cross-trajectory moves.
- **Distance safety score**: 4
- **Time Risk reason**: Deceleration and path parallel to egoâ€™s eliminate time collision risk.
- **Time safety score**: 4
- **Overall Risk score**: 4

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
The analysis of the scenario indicates that none of the obstacles pose any collision risk when assessing the defined safety metrics. With each obstacle maintaining a separate and safe trajectory relative to the ego vehicle, no indicators suggest an impending crash or need for extreme caution at the current time.
