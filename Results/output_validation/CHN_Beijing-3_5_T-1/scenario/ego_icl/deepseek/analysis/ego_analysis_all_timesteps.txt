Let me analyze the most recent timestep (9.2 seconds) for collision risks:

Obstacle-by-obstacle analysis:

1. Obstacle 3096 (Rear-left):
   - Longitudinal: -10.40m (moving away at -6.44m/s)
   - Lateral: 1.82m (very slight approach at -0.03m/s)
   - MDC: Lateral distance is safe (>1.5m)
   - TTC: Not applicable (moving away longitudinally)
   - Risk: 5 (No Risk)

2. Obstacle 3099 (Front-right):
   - Longitudinal: 8.67m (approaching at -0.76m/s)
   - Lateral: -13.33m (moving away at -8.91m/s)
   - MDC: Both distances increasing
   - TTC: Not applicable (diverging paths)
   - Risk: 5 (No Risk)

3. Obstacle 3100 (Front):
   - Longitudinal: 8.56m (approaching at -4.10m/s)
   - Lateral: 0.00m (aligned but moving away at 2.69m/s)
   - MDC: Longitudinal distance decreasing but still >5m
   - TTC: 8.56/4.10 = 2.09s (Medium Risk)
   - Risk: 3 (Medium Risk)

4. Obstacle 3101 (Rear-right):
   - Longitudinal: -22.76m (moving away at -0.88m/s)
   - Lateral: -7.95m (no motion)
   - MDC: Safe distances
   - TTC: Not applicable
   - Risk: 5 (No Risk)

5. Obstacle 3102 (Rear-left):
   - Longitudinal: -22.03m (moving away at -6.26m/s)
   - Lateral: 0.02m (approaching at -3.51m/s) - CRITICAL
   - MDC: 0.02m (Extreme Risk)
   - TTC: 0.02/3.51 = 0.0057s (Extreme Risk)
   - Risk: 0 (Collision occurring)

6. Obstacle 3103 (Front-right):
   - Longitudinal: 12.17m (approaching at -0.88m/s)
   - Lateral: -7.69m (no motion)
   - MDC: Safe distances
   - TTC: Not applicable
   - Risk: 5 (No Risk)

7. Obstacle 3104 (Front-right):
   - Longitudinal: 12.20m (approaching at -0.88m/s)
   - Lateral: -16.10m (approaching at 0.89m/s)
   - MDC: Safe distances
   - TTC: Not applicable
   - Risk: 5 (No Risk)

8. Obstacle 3107 (Behind):
   - Longitudinal: -0.14m (approaching at 1.92m/s)
   - Lateral: 0.00m (aligned)
   - MDC: 0.14m (Extreme Risk)
   - TTC: 0.14/1.92 = 0.073s (Extreme Risk)
   - Risk: 1 (Extreme Risk)

Trajectory Analysis:
- Obstacle 3102 shows consistent lateral approach from left with decreasing distance
- Obstacle 3107 shows consistent rear approach with distance decreasing below 0.5m
- Other obstacles maintain safe distances or are moving away
