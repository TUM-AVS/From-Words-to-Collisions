Obstacle-by-Obstacle Analysis at t=9.2s:

* **Obstacle 3096:** Rear-left (longitudinal: -10.40m, lateral: 1.82m). Moving away longitudinally, slightly toward ego laterally. Trajectory analysis shows it continues moving away longitudinally and lateral movement is minimal.  No risk of collision. Risk score: 5 (No Risk)

* **Obstacle 3099:** Front-right (longitudinal: 8.67m, lateral: -13.33m). Moving slightly toward ego longitudinally, significantly away laterally. The lateral distance is greater and increasing, mitigating longitudinal approach. TTClong = 8.67m/0.76m/s ≈ 11.41s. Risk score: 5 (No Risk).

* **Obstacle 3100:** Front (longitudinal: 8.56m, lateral: 0.00m). Laterally aligned but longitudinal distance is substantial. TTClong = 8.56m/4.10m/s ≈ 2.09s. MDC assessment: Although laterally aligned, lateral velocity is positive (2.69 m/s), indicating it's likely moving out of alignment.  Risk score: 3 (Medium Risk) due to TTC.

* **Obstacle 3101:** Rear-right (longitudinal: -22.76m, lateral: -7.95m). Moving away in both directions. No collision risk. Risk score: 5 (No Risk).

* **Obstacle 3102:** Rear-left (longitudinal: -22.03m, lateral: 0.02m). Almost laterally aligned but moving away longitudinally. The small lateral distance needs attention, but trajectory shows its longitudinal movement away from ego is dominant. Risk score: 5 (No Risk)

* **Obstacle 3103:** Front-right (longitudinal: 12.17m, lateral: -7.69m). Moving slightly toward ego longitudinally, significantly away laterally. Lateral motion is away from the ego vehicle, mitigating longitudinal approach. TTClong = 12.17m/0.88m/s ≈ 13.83s. Risk score: 5 (No Risk).

* **Obstacle 3104:** Front-right (longitudinal: 12.20m, lateral: -16.10m). Moving slightly toward ego longitudinally, away laterally.  Similar to 3103, lateral distance is large and increasing. TTClong = 12.20m/0.88m/s ≈ 13.86s. Risk score: 5 (No Risk)

* **Obstacle 3107:** Behind (longitudinal: -0.14m, lateral: 0.00m).  Laterally aligned and very close longitudinally. The negative longitudinal distance indicates the obstacle is slightly behind, but closing rapidly (2.13 m/s at t=9.1s, 1.92 m/s at t=9.2s, relative velocity is decreasing but still considerable). TTClong = 0.14m/1.92m/s ≈ 0.07s. MDC is extremely low (≈ 0.14m). This is extremely dangerous. Risk score: 1 (Extreme Risk) due to both extremely low TTC and MDC.

Collision Scenario Determination:

Yes, this is a collision scenario. Obstacle 3107 poses an Extreme Risk (score 1) with a very low TTC (0.07s) and MDC (0.14m), indicating a likely imminent collision.
