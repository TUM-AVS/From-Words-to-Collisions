Here's the collision risk analysis:

**Obstacle 30655:** This obstacle is stationary in the same lane as the ego vehicle.  The minimum distance between the ego vehicle and this obstacle over the provided time steps is approximately 4.5 meters. While the ego vehicle is decelerating, the consistent distance and stationary nature of the obstacle suggest a low risk of collision in the immediate future. I assess the risk as **3 (Medium Risk)**. It is manageable but requires monitoring.

**Obstacle 30656:** This obstacle is in a different lane (initially 460, then 1191) than the ego vehicle and moving with a speed of around 8 m/s and even accelerates. Given its trajectory and different lane, it poses no immediate collision risk. Therefore, I assess the risk as **5 (Negligible Risk)**.

**Obstacle 30658:**  This obstacle is in the same lane as the ego vehicle, but slightly ahead and also moving forward, albeit with a decreasing velocity. The distance between the ego and this obstacle is increasing over time, as the ego is decelerating faster than the obstacle. Although they are in the same lane, the diverging trajectories indicate a very low chance of collision. I assess the risk as **4 (Low Risk)**.
