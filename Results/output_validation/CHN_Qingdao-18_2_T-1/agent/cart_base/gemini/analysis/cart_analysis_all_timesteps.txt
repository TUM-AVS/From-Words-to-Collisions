Obstacle 30655: This obstacle is stationary.  While it is in the same lane as the ego vehicle, the ego vehicle is moving away from it. The lateral distance is also significant. Therefore, this obstacle poses no risk.

Obstacle 30656: This obstacle is in a different lane (1191) than the ego vehicle (465) and moving away from the ego vehicle. While initially (at t=3.0s) it was in a lane close to the ego vehicle (lane 460), its subsequent trajectory clearly shows no risk of collision.

Obstacle 30658: This obstacle is in the same lane as the ego vehicle (465). Both are moving forward, but the ego vehicle is decelerating significantly while Obstacle 30658 maintains a relatively constant velocity. The distance between them is decreasing over the timesteps.  Although a collision doesn't appear imminent within the observed timeframe, the closing speeds and deceleration of the ego vehicle suggest a high risk of collision in the near future. This warrants a high-risk score.
