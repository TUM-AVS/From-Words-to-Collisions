### Analysis

Based on the final timestep (3.9 seconds):

1. **Obstacle 30655.0** (Stationary Obstacle):
   - Position: Very close to Ego vehicle (Ego: (602.9672, -2179.6943); Obstacle: (599.8082, -2184.3219)).
   - Velocity: 0.0 (stationary).
   - The extremely close proximity to the stationary obstacle coupled with Ego's movement trajectory suggests that without intervention, Ego might collide. 
   - Risk Level: 1 (Extreme Risk)

2. **Obstacle 30656.0**:
   - Position: Moving away from Ego vehicle with its lane change to another lanelet (1191.0).
   - Velocity: 9.4521, heading in a direction that minimizes interaction with Ego.
   - Considering its path diverges significantly from Ego's, this obstacle poses minimal risk.
   - Risk Level: 5 (Negligible Risk)

3. **Obstacle 30658.0**:
   - Position: In the same lanelet as Ego, but the trajectory indicates increasing distance.
   - Velocity: 6.2092, which indicates it's moving but slightly faster than Ego.
   - Although in the same laneand heading, the trajectory angles and acceleration suggest no immediate threat.
   - Risk Level: 3 (Medium Risk)
