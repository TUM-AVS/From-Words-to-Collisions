### Analysis:

1. **Obstacle 30655 (Stationary):**
   - Position: (599.8082, -2184.3219)  
   - Ego is moving towards this obstacle but is decelerating.  
   - Distance at 3.9s: ~4.6m (longitudinal), lateral distance minimal (same lanelet).  
   - TTC: Decreasing but ego is slowing down. Risk is **Medium (3)** as collision is avoidable with current deceleration.

2. **Obstacle 30656 (Moving away):**
   - Position: (595.5587, -2194.7839)  
   - Moving away from ego with increasing velocity.  
   - Lateral distance significant, no immediate risk.  
   - Risk: **Negligible (5)**.

3. **Obstacle 30658 (Ahead in same lane):**
   - Position: (609.7683, -2158.3147)  
   - Ego is decelerating, obstacle is decelerating faster.  
   - Distance at 3.9s: ~6.8m (longitudinal), lateral distance minimal.  
   - TTC: High as both are decelerating. Risk: **Low (4)**.

### Highest Risks:
- No collision or extreme risk observed. The closest obstacle (30655) is stationary, and ego is decelerating to avoid it.
