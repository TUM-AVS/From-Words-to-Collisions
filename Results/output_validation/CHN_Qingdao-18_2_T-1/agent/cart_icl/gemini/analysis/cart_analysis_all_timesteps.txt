At timestep 3.9s, Obstacle 30655 is stationary in the same lane as the ego vehicle, and the ego vehicle is approaching it.  The distance between them is decreasing over each timestep. This represents a very high risk of collision if the ego vehicle does not brake or change lanes.

Obstacle 30658 is in the same lane as the ego vehicle, but further ahead. The distance between them is decreasing slightly over each timestep as the ego vehicle decelerates slower than obstacle 30658. This represents a low risk since there is still adequate distance. 

Obstacle 30656 is in a different lanelet and moving away from the ego vehicle.  It does not pose a collision risk.
