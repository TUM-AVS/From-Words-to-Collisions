To evaluate the potential risk levels for each obstacle in comparison to the ego vehicle, let's analyze the given scenario by looking at the latest timestep data at 3.9 seconds and considering previous motion trends.

### Analysis:

**Obstacle 30655:**
- **Position:** (599.8082, -2184.3219)
- **Velocity:** 0.0 m/s (stationary)
- **Lanelet:** 465.0 (same as ego)
- **Distance to Ego:** Approximately 5.4 meters
- **Risk Assessment:** As this obstacle is stationary and directly in the ego vehicle's lane at a close distance, it represents an imminent collision threat as per the TTC being zero, and no lateral space available due to proximity. It is necessary to take immediate action to avoid collision.
- **Overall Risk Score:** 0 - Collision Physical contact occurred or unavoidable

**Obstacle 30656:**
- **Position:** (595.5587, -2194.7839)
- **Velocity:** 9.4521 m/s
- **Lanelet:** 1191.0 (different from ego)
- **Distance to Ego:** Approximately 7.1 meters, moving away
- **Risk Assessment:** Although this obstacle is close to the ego vehicle, it is on a different lanelet and moving away, significantly reducing the risk of collision. 
- **Overall Risk Score:** 4 - Low Risk No immediate danger

**Obstacle 30658:**
- **Position:** (609.7683, -2158.3147)
- **Velocity:** 6.2092 m/s
- **Lanelet:** 465.0 (same as ego)
- **Distance to Ego:** Approximately 21.4 meters
- **Risk Assessment:** While in the same lanelet and moving slowly, the significant distance mitigates any immediate collision risk. The velocities are such that the gap will likely close slowly, affording time for evasive maneuvers.
- **Overall Risk Score:** 3 - Medium Risk Manageable with driver/system response

### Conclusion:

While Obstacle 30658 represents a medium risk due to close relative proximity in the same lanelet, immediate attention is required for Obstacle 30655 which poses an imminent collision risk due to its stationary nature and direct path obstructing the ego vehicle.
