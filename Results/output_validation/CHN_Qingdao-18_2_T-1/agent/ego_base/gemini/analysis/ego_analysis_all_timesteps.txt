Obstacle 30655 is in the Front-right of the ego car. The real distance is longitudinal 0.77 m and lateral -0.28 m. Relative velocity: longitudinal -4.24 m/s, lateral -0.00 m/s.  The longitudinal distance is very small and the obstacle is moving towards the ego vehicle, indicating a very high risk of collision. Risk score: 1.

Obstacle 30656 is in the Front-right of the ego car. The real distance is longitudinal 11.96 m and lateral -1.74 m. Relative velocity: longitudinal -10.59 m/s, lateral 7.00 m/s. The obstacle is relatively far and moving towards the ego vehicle longitudinally, but laterally it's moving away. Considering the distances and velocities, it represents a medium risk. Risk Score: 3

Obstacle 30658 is in the Behind of the ego car. The real distance is longitudinal -17.90 m and lateral 0.00 m. Relative velocity: longitudinal 1.71 m/s, lateral 1.77 m/s. The obstacle is behind the ego vehicle and moving away longitudinally. Although it has some lateral velocity, its longitudinal movement reduces the risk considerably. Risk Score: 4


Risk Levels:
0: Collision - Physical contact occurred or unavoidable
1: Extreme Risk - Immediate collision likely
2: High Risk - Close to collision, needs quick action
3: Medium Risk - Manageable with proper reaction
4: Low Risk - Minimal risk, sufficient time to react
5: Negligible Risk - No significant risk
