### Safety analysis for timestep 3.9 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

**- Obstacle ID: 30655**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 30655 is extremely close to the ego vehicle, at a longitudinal and lateral distance of 0.77m.  The relative velocity indicates it is moving towards the ego vehicle longitudinally. This represents a very high risk of collision.
- Distance safety score: 1 (Extreme Risk)
- Time Risk reason: Given the closing velocity and minimal distance, the TTC is very low, indicating imminent collision risk if the trajectory is maintained.
- Time safety score: 1 (Extreme Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 1 (Extreme Risk)

**- Obstacle ID: 30656**
- Distance Risk reason: At 11.96 m both longitudinally and laterally, this obstacle poses a low risk, although its lateral movement towards the ego should be monitored.
- Distance safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
- Time Risk reason: TTC values, while not immediately alarming, suggest that this obstacle could become a concern if the current trajectories continue. Continuous monitoring is needed.
- Time safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 4 (Low Risk)

**- Obstacle ID: 30658**
- Distance Risk reason:  This obstacle is behind the ego vehicle at a safe distance.
- Distance safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- Time Risk reason: Although approaching the ego vehicle from behind, the distance and relative velocity suggest sufficient time to react.
- Time safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
