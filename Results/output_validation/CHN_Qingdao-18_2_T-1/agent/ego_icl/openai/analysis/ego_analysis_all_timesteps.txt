## Obstacle Analysis

### Obstacle 30655
- **Position:** Front-right of the ego vehicle
- **Adjusted Distances at 3.9 seconds:** Longitudinal 0.77 m, Lateral -0.28 m
- **Velocity:** Longitudinal -4.24 m/s, Lateral -0.00 m/s
- **Motion Description:** Driving toward the ego car longitudinally with no lateral relative motion.

#### Trajectory & Risk Analysis:
- **TTC Longitudinal:** \( \text{TTC} = \frac{0.77 \, \text{m}}{|4.24 \, \text{m/s}|} = 0.18 \, \text{s} \) (Approaching quickly)
- **MDC:** Due to continuous closing and being below 0.5m, this obstacle presents an **Extreme Risk.**

- **Risk Level:** As both the longitudinal distance is near zero and with a quick approaching speed, and considering the trajectory data, there's an imminent threat of collision.
- **Overall Determination:** **Extreme Risk** (1)

### Obstacle 30656
- **Position:** Front-right of the ego vehicle
- **Adjusted Distances at 3.9 seconds:** Longitudinal 11.96 m, Lateral -1.74 m
- **Velocity:** Longitudinal -10.59 m/s, Lateral 7.00 m/s
- **Motion Description:** Driving toward the ego car longitudinally and from the right laterally.

#### Trajectory & Risk Analysis:
- **TTC Longitudinal:** \( \text{TTC} = \frac{11.96 \, \text{m}}{|10.59 \, \text{m/s}|} = 1.13 \, \text{s} \)
- **TTC Lateral:** \( \text{TTC} = \frac{1.74 \, \text{m}}{|7.00 \, \text{m/s}|} = 0.25 \, \text{s} \) (Significantly approaching)
- **MDC:** The lateral approach combined with quick convergence indicates a **High Risk.**

- **Risk Level:** Due to fast closing on the lateral dimension primarily, as well as rapid longitudinal approach, the obstacle poses a substantial collision risk.
- **Overall Determination:** **High Risk** (2)

### Obstacle 30658
- **Position:** Behind the ego vehicle
- **Adjusted Distances at 3.9 seconds:** Longitudinal -17.90 m, Lateral 0.00 m
- **Velocity:** Longitudinal 1.71 m/s, Lateral 1.77 m/s
- **Motion Description:** Driving towards the ego car from behind, aligned in the lane.

#### Trajectory & Risk Analysis:
- **TTC Longitudinal:** Since it is driving away or not closing, TTC is not applicable for the collision.
- **MDC:** The obstacle is significantly behind and moving parallel. It poses zero immediate threat.

- **Risk Level:** As the obstacle does not approach significantly, it currently represents a **Negligible Risk.**
- **Overall Determination:** **Negligible Risk** (5)
