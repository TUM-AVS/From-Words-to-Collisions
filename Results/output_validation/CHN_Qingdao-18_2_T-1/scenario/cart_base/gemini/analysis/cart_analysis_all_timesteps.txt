At t=4.1s, Ego (30657.0) is in lanelet 465.0 and decelerating.

Obstacle 30655.0 is stationary in the same lanelet as Ego, but their y-coordinates suggest it's behind Ego.  The distance between them seems sufficient for now, but continued deceleration by Ego while 30655.0 remains stationary could eventually lead to a collision if Ego's deceleration isn't controlled. This merits monitoring but isn't an immediate extreme risk.

Obstacle 30656.0 is in a different lanelet (1191.0) and appears to be moving away from Ego. This poses no immediate risk.

Obstacle 30658.0 is in the same lanelet as Ego and ahead, but also decelerating. The distance between them seems sufficient for now and both are decelerating, suggesting the risk is low.
