### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

- Obstacle ID: 30655.0
- Distance Risk reason: This obstacle is stationary and located in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle.  While not extremely close at the last timestep, the proximity and lack of movement from the obstacle over the entire time period represent a significant risk if the ego vehicle continues its current trajectory.  The distance between them hasn't decreased dramatically in the past few timesteps, suggesting a possible slight divergence in paths, hence not an extreme risk.
- Distance safety score: 2
- Time Risk reason: The ego vehicle's velocity is decreasing, but it is still moving towards the stationary obstacle. This poses a high risk of collision in the near future if the ego vehicle does not brake sufficiently or change lanes.
- Time safety score: 2
- Overall Risk score: 2

- Obstacle ID: 30656.0
- Distance Risk reason:  This obstacle is in a different lanelet (1191) than the ego vehicle (465) and is moving away.  Across all timesteps, the lateral distance between the vehicles has increased.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: The relative velocities and trajectories indicate no risk of collision.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 30658.0
- Distance Risk reason: This obstacle is in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle, but ahead and moving in the same general direction.  While the distance between the vehicles hasn't decreased significantly in the recent timesteps, it remains relatively close.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: Both vehicles are moving in the same general direction, with obstacle 30658.0 slightly ahead. The ego vehicle's speed is decreasing while obstacle 30658.0's speed is also decreasing, but at a slower rate. This suggests a decreasing risk of collision over time, as the relative velocity is reducing and there is some longitudinal separation.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3



### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. **Most critical obstacle:** Obstacle 30655.0 poses the most immediate risk due to its stationary presence in the ego vehicle's lanelet and the ego vehicle's decreasing but still positive velocity.  
2. **Trajectory analysis:** Over the 10 timesteps, Obstacle 30655.0 remained stationary, while the ego vehicle approached it, although the rate of approach slowed. Obstacle 30656.0 consistently moved further away in a different lanelet. Obstacle 30658.0 stayed ahead of the ego vehicle in the same lane, with both vehicles moving in the same general direction and slowing down.
3. **Relative positions, velocities, and accelerations:** The ego vehicle is gradually decelerating. The relative velocity between the ego vehicle and obstacle 30655.0 is significant given the stationary nature of the obstacle. The relative velocity between the ego vehicle and obstacle 30658.0 is decreasing.
4. **Collision determination:**  No collision has occurred yet. However, a collision with Obstacle 30655.0 is probable if the ego vehicle doesn't decelerate quickly enough or change lanes.
5. **Reasoning:** The consistent position of the static obstacle 30655.0 within the ego vehicle's path, coupled with the ego vehicle's movement toward it, creates a high probability of collision if evasive action isn't taken promptly.
