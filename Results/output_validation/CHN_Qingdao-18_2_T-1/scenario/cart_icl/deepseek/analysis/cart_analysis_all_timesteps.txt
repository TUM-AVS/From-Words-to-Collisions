### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep (4.1 seconds):

### Obstacle Analysis:
1. **Obstacle ID: 30655.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Static obstacle in the same lanelet (465.0), but distance is increasing over time (from ~8.13m to ~8.82m). Orientation aligns with ego's path.
   - **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: Zero velocity and acceleration. No immediate collision threat.
   - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low Risk)

2. **Obstacle ID: 30656.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Moving away in lanelet 1191.0 (different lanelet). Distance increases from ~20.1m to ~13.2m over 10 timesteps.
   - **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: High velocity (9.68 m/s) but moving perpendicular to ego's path (orientation ~0.64 rad).
   - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)

3. **Obstacle ID: 30658.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: In same lanelet (465.0) but moving away (distance increases from ~22.5m to ~21.0m). Orientation diverging (-1.60 rad).
   - **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: Decelerating (5.84 m/s, -1.68 m/s²). Relative velocity favors separation.
   - **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low Risk)

4. **Obstacle ID: 30659.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: In same lanelet (465.0), distance decreases slightly (from ~32.0m to ~26.6m). Orientation (-0.54 rad) suggests converging paths.
   - **Distance safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: Decelerating (6.40 m/s, -2.06 m/s²). Relative velocity is ~2.65 m/s (ego: 3.75 m/s).
   - **Time safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 3 (Medium Risk)

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. No obstacles are in immediate collision state (all distances > 8m).
2. Obstacle 30659.0 shows moderate risk due to converging trajectory but has sufficient TTC (~10s).
3. Ego is decelerating (-1.39 m/s²), reducing collision likelihood further.
4. All other obstacles are either static or moving away.
