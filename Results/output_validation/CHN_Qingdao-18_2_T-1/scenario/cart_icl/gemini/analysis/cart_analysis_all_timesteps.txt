### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 30655.0
- Distance Risk reason: Stationary and positioned laterally close to the ego vehicle, within the same lane.  History shows consistent proximity.
- Distance safety score: 2
- Time Risk reason: Stationary, posing a continuous risk as ego vehicle moves forward.
- Time safety score: 2
- Overall Risk score: 2

- Obstacle ID: 30656.0
- Distance Risk reason: Located in a different lanelet and moving away laterally. History shows increasing lateral separation.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Although accelerating, the lateral movement mitigates collision risk.  History confirms diverging paths.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 30658.0
- Distance Risk reason: Located longitudinally further ahead in the same lanelet. History shows increasing longitudinal separation.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Moving at a similar speed to the ego vehicle but decelerating, reducing the risk of collision. History shows separation.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4


### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. **Obstacle 30655.0:** Poses the most significant risk due to its stationary position in the same lane and proximity to the ego vehicle.
2. **Obstacle 30656.0:**  No collision risk as it is in a different lanelet and moving away laterally.
3. **Obstacle 30658.0:** Low collision risk due to its increasing longitudinal distance from the ego vehicle and deceleration.

This is not a collision scenario as no obstacle has a risk score of 0.

### Summary in JSON Format:

{
  "CollisionObstacles": [],
  "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null,
  "ScenarioAnalysis": {
    "IsCollisionScenario": false,
    "Reasoning": "No obstacle has a risk score of 0. Obstacle 30655.0 poses the highest risk (score 2) due to its stationary position and proximity to the ego vehicle, but this is classified as high risk, not a collision."
