### Obstacle Analysis:

#### Obstacle ID: 30655.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: This obstacle has been stationary in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle throughout the scenario. The obstacle is located at (599.8082, -2184.3219), and the ego position at the last timestep is at (602.7093, -2180.5002). The proximity indicates minimal distance separation.
- **Distance safety score**: 1 (Extreme risk due to stationary position in the same lanelet and close proximity to the ego vehicle)
- **Time Risk reason**: The stagnation and lack of mobility present significant risk factors since the other metrics like velocity and acceleration are zero, suggesting no change in its state.
- **Time safety score**: 1 (An urgent timeframe is suggested given the stationary nature and location)
- **Overall Risk score**: 1

#### Obstacle ID: 30656.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: This obstacle is in a different lanelet (1191.0) with a continual increment in distance from the ego vehicle. The position at 4.1 seconds is (597.0909, -2193.7266), indicating no immediate proximity risk with the ego vehicle.
- **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible risk due to the different lane and increasing distance)
- **Time Risk reason**: The obstacle has been accelerating and increasing its velocity over time, but given its trajectory, it's moving further away from the ego vehicle.
- **Time safety score**: 5 (No imminent risk as relative velocity and position don't intercede with the ego)
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 30658.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: This obstacle has been continually shifting its position but remains in the same lanelet 465.0 as the ego vehicle. At the last timestep, the distance is sufficient to allow safe passage.
- **Distance safety score**: 3 (Medium risk due to being in the same lanelet but positioned further ahead)
- **Time Risk reason**: Over time, its velocity has been decreasing, and the trend suggests it's moving away from the ego vehicle's path instead of encroaching.
- **Time safety score**: 4 (Low risk as trends indicate movement away over the last five timesteps)
- **Overall Risk score**: 3

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
The scenario indicates one obstacle (30655.0) posing an extreme risk due to its stationary state in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle without any changes in velocity or position and very close proximity. However, the circumstances provide sufficient pathway management for the ego vehicle, suggesting no immediate collision just yet, if prompt and adequate maneuvering could be executed.
