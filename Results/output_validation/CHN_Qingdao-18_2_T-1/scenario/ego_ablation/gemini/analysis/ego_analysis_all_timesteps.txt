Obstacle 30655 is at high risk of collision with the ego vehicle. It is only 0.05 meters away longitudinally and has a relative longitudinal velocity of -3.75 m/s, indicating it is moving towards the ego vehicle.  While the relative acceleration is negative, the proximity and velocity suggest an imminent collision.

Obstacle 30656, while further away at 9.82 meters longitudinally, also presents a high risk. Its high closing velocity of -11.74 m/s longitudinally indicates it is rapidly approaching the ego vehicle. Though not immediately about to collide, it warrants close monitoring and evasive action may soon be necessary.

Obstacle 30658 is not a high risk at this time. Though it is approaching the ego vehicle from behind, its longitudinal distance of -17.64 meters and moderate relative velocity of 1.83 m/s provides sufficient time and space for the ego vehicle to react if necessary.
