Obstacle 30655 is at a longitudinal distance of 0.05m from the ego vehicle and approaching at -3.75 m/s.  This is extremely close and suggests a likely collision in the next timestep.

**Risk Levels and Definitions:**
Collision (Score: 0): Actual collision has occurred or is unavoidable within the next timestep.
Extreme Risk (Score: 1): Immediate collision or very high likelihood of impact. Urgent action is required.
High Risk (Score: 2): Close to collision or highly probable collision path. Needs prompt attention and quick manoeuvring.
Medium Risk (Score: 3): Moderate collision risk but manageable with timely reactions and proper strategies.
Low Risk (Score: 4): Minimal collision risk. The situation is controllable with sufficient time to react.
Negligible Risk (Score: 5): No significant collision risk. Obstacles are either moving away or far enough not to interfere.
