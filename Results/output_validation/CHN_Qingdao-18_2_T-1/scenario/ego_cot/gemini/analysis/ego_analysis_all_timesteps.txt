### Safety analysis for timestep 3.2s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 30655
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 30655 is very close to the ego vehicle (4.7m longitudinally and laterally) and approaching from the front.
- Distance safety score: 2
- Time Risk reason: The relative longitudinal velocity is -5.98 m/s, and the distance is 4.7m, indicating a very short TTC.
- Time safety score: 1
- Overall Risk score: 1

- Obstacle ID: 30656
- Distance Risk reason: At 20.04m longitudinally and laterally, it poses a low risk currently. However, it's moving towards the ego vehicle both longitudinally and laterally.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: While the distances are currently safe, the converging trajectories require monitoring.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- Obstacle ID: 30658
- Distance Risk reason:  Located 17.63m behind and to the right, it is moving away longitudinally but towards the ego vehicle laterally.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Moving away longitudinally mitigates risk, but the lateral movement needs attention.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

### Safety analysis for timestep 4.1s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 30655
- Distance Risk reason: Extremely close to the ego vehicle (0.05m longitudinally and laterally). Collision is virtually imminent.
- Distance safety score: 0
- Time Risk reason: Given the distance and closing velocity, TTC is essentially zero.
- Time safety score: 0
- Overall Risk score: 0

- Obstacle ID: 30656
- Distance Risk reason: While 9.82m longitudinally and laterally suggests a moderate distance, the high closing velocity is concerning.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: Requires attention and potential evasive maneuvers due to the high relative velocity.
- Time safety score: 2
- Overall Risk score: 2

- Obstacle ID: 30658
- Distance Risk reason: Located 17.64m behind, the longitudinal distance poses no immediate risk.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason:  Moving towards the ego vehicle from behind. However, the relative velocity is low, and the distance is substantial enough to avoid a collision at the current velocity.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

**Detailed Explanation for 4.1s (Collision Scenario):**

At 4.1 seconds, the analysis clearly indicates a collision with Obstacle 30655. The distance is negligible (0.05m), and the closing velocity is still significant.  The JSON summary correctly identifies this as a collision scenario. Obstacle 30656 poses a high risk due to its closing velocity, but it is not an immediate collision. Obstacle 30658 remains a low risk at this time step.


**Important Considerations:**

* **Lateral Movement:** The lateral movement of Obstacles 30656 and 30658, particularly 30656's converging trajectory, would need careful monitoring even though the longitudinal distance is larger.

* **Accuracy of Sensor Data:**  The reliability of these calculations depends heavily on the accuracy of the sensor data.  Noisy or inaccurate sensor readings could lead to incorrect risk assessments.

* **Predictive Capabilities:** This analysis is a snapshot in time. A robust autonomous driving system must predict future trajectories to anticipate potential collisions further in advance and execute evasive maneuvers effectively.
