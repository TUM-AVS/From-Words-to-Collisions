# Collision Risk Analysis on Latest Timestep (4.1 seconds)

## Obstacle 30655
- **Position**: Front of ego vehicle
- **Adjusted Distances**: Longitudinal = 0.05 m, Lateral = 0.00 m
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal = -3.75 m/s, Lateral = 0.00 m/s
- **Motion**: Exact lateral alignment, approaching longitudinally

### Trajectory Analysis
- **Previous Timesteps**: Decreasing longitudinal distance consistently from around 4.70 m to 0.05 m, maintaining lateral alignment.
- **Velocity Consistency**: Continues to close in longitudinally with consistent negative longitudinal velocity.

### Calculations
- **Time-to-Collision (TTC)**: Longitudinal distance / |Relative Velocity| = 0.05 m / 3.75 m/s = 0.0133 seconds
- **Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC)**: Given the exact alignment and closing distance, MDC ≈ 0.05 m

### Risk Assessment
- With the lateral alignment and near-zero longitudinal distance, TTC is extremely low indicating immediate collision is imminent.
- **Overall Risk Score**: 0 (Collision occurring)

## Obstacle 30656
- **Position**: Front of ego vehicle
- **Adjusted Distances**: Longitudinal = 9.82 m, Lateral = 0.00 m
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal = -11.74 m/s, Lateral = 5.47 m/s
- **Motion**: Exact lateral alignment, approaching longitudinally

### Trajectory Analysis
- **Previous Timesteps**: Consistent decrease in longitudinal distance and closing gap in lateral positioning.
- **Velocity Consistency**: High longitudinal closing speed with ongoing lateral maneuvering; closing primarily longitudinally.

### Calculations
- **Time-to-Collision (TTC)**: Longitudinal distance / |Relative Velocity| = 9.82 m / 11.74 m/s ≈ 0.836 seconds
- **Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC)**: With decreasing longitudinal distance, approaching within a close margin, but not immediate.

### Risk Assessment
- Approaching rapidly but with a slightly larger margin of error due to distance.
- **Overall Risk Score**: 2 (High Risk)

## Obstacle 30658
- **Position**: Behind the ego vehicle
- **Adjusted Distances**: Longitudinal = 17.64 m, Lateral = 0.00 m
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal = 1.83 m/s, Lateral = 1.71 m/s
- **Motion**: Exact lateral alignment, moving away longitudinally but approaching laterally

### Trajectory Analysis
- **Previous Timesteps**: Maintaining distance relative to ego, slight increase in longitudinal distance while reducing lateral distance.
- **Velocity Consistency**: Positive longitudinal velocity indicates moving apart, minimized collision risk along the rear trajectory.

### Calculations
- **Time-to-Collision (TTC)**: Not applicable longitudinally (moving apart); lateral convergence slowdown.
- **Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC)**: Ample spacing and positive velocity imply negligible risk.

### Risk Assessment
- Given the significant longitudinal distance and aligning velocity elements, no immediate collision risk.
- **Overall Risk Score**: 5 (No Risk)

# Conclusion
- **Collision Scenario Determination**: The scenario qualifies as a collision scenario as Obstacle 30655 has a direct collision risk at the most recent timestep. The obstacle is nearly at a standstill in terms of mitigating options with minimal distance and zero relative lateral movement.
