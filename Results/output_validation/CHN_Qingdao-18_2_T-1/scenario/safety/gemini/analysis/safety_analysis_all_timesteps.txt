### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
    - Obstacle ID: 30655
    - Relative Direction: Front
    - Distance Risk Reason: DTClong is 0.05m, extremely close and indicating a near collision.  The obstacle has consistently approached the ego vehicle over the past several timesteps. DTClat is 0.00 m, meaning no lateral offset, consistent with the front collision trajectory observed over the previous timesteps.
    - Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 0
    - Lateral Distance Safety Score: 0
    - Overall Distance Safety Score: 0.0
    - Time Risk Reason: TTClong is 0.01s, indicating imminent collision risk longitudinally. TTClat is 0.00s. The longitudinal TTC has been decreasing rapidly over the past few timesteps, further confirming an impending collision.
    - Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 0
    - Lateral Time Safety Score: 0
    - Overall Time Safety Score: 0.0
    - Overall Risk Score: 0

    - Obstacle ID: 30656
    - Relative Direction: Front
    - Distance Risk Reason: DTClong is 9.82m, placing it at a low risk. While this distance suggests a relatively safe margin, the historical data shows that this obstacle has been consistently approaching the ego vehicle. DTClat is 0.00m, representing no lateral offset.
    - Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 5
    - Lateral Distance Safety Score: 5
    - Overall Distance Safety Score: 5.0
    - Time Risk Reason: TTClong is 0.84s, indicating a high risk. TTClat is 0.00.  The longitudinal TTC has been steadily decreasing over time indicating a continuing trend toward increasing risk.
    - Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 2
    - Lateral Time Safety Score: 0
    - Overall Time Safety Score: 2.0
    - Overall Risk Score: 4

    - Obstacle ID: 30658
    - Relative Direction: Behind
    - Distance Risk Reason: DTClong is -17.64m, indicating the obstacle is behind the ego vehicle and moving away, posing no collision risk. DTClat is 0.00m, showing no lateral offset. The obstacle has consistently remained behind the ego vehicle over the observed timesteps.
    - Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 5
    - Lateral Distance Safety Score: 5
    - Overall Distance Safety Score: 5.0
    - Time Risk Reason: TTClong is 9.62s, indicating a negligible collision risk. TTClat is 0.00s. The high TTC value, coupled with the obstacle's position and trajectory, strongly suggests no immediate collision concerns.
    - Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 5
    - Lateral Time Safety Score: 0
    - Overall Time Safety Score: 5.0
    - Overall Risk Score: 5
