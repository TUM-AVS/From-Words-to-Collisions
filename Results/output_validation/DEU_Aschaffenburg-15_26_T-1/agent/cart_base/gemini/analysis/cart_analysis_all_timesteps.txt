Obstacle 30420:  Far away and stationary. Negligible risk (5).
Obstacle 30423: Far away and stationary. Negligible risk (5).
Obstacle 30424: Far away and stationary. Negligible risk (5).
Obstacle 30426: Far away and stationary. Negligible risk (5).
Obstacle 30438:  Moving away from ego, and though lane changes occur for this obstacle, the trajectories do not intersect. Low risk (4).
Obstacle 30441:  This obstacle's trajectory shows it moving closer to the ego vehicle and eventually sharing the same lanelet (1999).  While the provided data doesn't show an immediate collision, the rapid approach and lane merging represent a high risk of collision in the near future (2).
Obstacle 30443:  Although initially somewhat close, this obstacle is moving further away from the ego vehicle. Medium risk (3).
