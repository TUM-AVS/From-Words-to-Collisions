Obstacle 30441 is showing concerning behavior. It has decelerated significantly (-5.0329) over the past two timesteps and is now moving into the ego vehicle's lanelet (1999).  Its trajectory suggests a possible lane change maneuver, but its deceleration and proximity to the ego vehicle create a high risk of collision if the ego vehicle does not react.  Obstacle 30438 is moving at a high velocity relative to the ego vehicle, but it maintains a safe lateral distance and is not currently a high risk. Obstacle 30443 continues to decelerate but appears to be moving away from the ego vehicle's path.  The stationary obstacles are not considered a risk at this time.
