### Analysis of Risky Obstacles:

1. **Obstacle 30441 (High Risk)**:
   - **Position**: (222.1031, -4.4537) at 6.8s, moving towards the ego vehicle.
   - **Velocity**: 6.8275 m/s, with a slight acceleration of 0.3598 m/s².
   - **Relative Motion**: The obstacle is in the same lanelet (1999.0) as the ego vehicle and is approaching from the front. The lateral distance is significant, but the longitudinal distance is closing.
   - **TTC**: The relative longitudinal distance is decreasing, but the exact TTC is not critical yet. The risk is high due to proximity and same-lanelet status.

2. **Obstacle 30438 (Medium Risk)**:
   - **Position**: (251.3652, 2.0585) at 6.8s, moving away from the ego vehicle.
   - **Velocity**: 7.8852 m/s, with an acceleration of 0.8172 m/s².
   - **Relative Motion**: The obstacle is ahead of the ego vehicle and moving away. The lateral distance is significant, and the longitudinal distance is increasing.
   - **TTC**: Not critical as the obstacle is moving away.

3. **Obstacle 30443 (Medium Risk)**:
   - **Position**: (220.2471, 9.8646) at 6.8s, moving towards the ego vehicle.
   - **Velocity**: 7.0747 m/s, with an acceleration of 0.7189 m/s².
   - **Relative Motion**: The obstacle is laterally distant but moving towards the ego vehicle. The longitudinal distance is not critical yet.
   - **TTC**: Not critical due to lateral separation.
