Obstacle 30441 is showing risky behavior. It is in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle and rapidly approaching from behind.  Its negative y-coordinate suggests a potential lane change maneuver, but the decreasing distance and high closing speed raise concerns about a potential imminent collision if it remains on its current trajectory.
