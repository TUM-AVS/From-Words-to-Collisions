At timestamp 6.8 seconds, the following analysis is performed for each obstacle:

**Obstacle 30420:** Located in the Rear-left, moving away longitudinally and no lateral relative motion.  This obstacle poses no risk. Risk score: 5

**Obstacle 30423:** Located in the Front-left, driving toward the ego car longitudinally with a large lateral distance, and no lateral relative motion.  This obstacle poses no risk given the large lateral distance.. Risk score: 5

**Obstacle 30424:** Located in the Rear-left, moving away longitudinally and no lateral relative motion.  This obstacle poses no risk. Risk score: 5

**Obstacle 30426:** Located in the Front-right, driving toward the ego car longitudinally at a distance of 1.30m. While the longitudinal distance is small, the relative velocity is -0.89 m/s indicating a slow approach speed. The relative acceleration 0.48 m/sÂ² suggests that the obstacle might be slowing down further. Although near, its motion pattern doesn't imply an immediate collision. Risk score: 2 (High risk due to proximity)

**Obstacle 30438:** Located in the Front-left, moving away both longitudinally and laterally. This obstacle poses no risk. Risk score: 5

**Obstacle 30441:** Located directly behind the ego car at a distance of -1.17m. The relative velocity is 4.50 m/s indicating that the obstacle is approaching rapidly from behind. The scenario describes the lateral alignment as "Exact lateral alignment or unknown case." This suggests a potential rear-end collision risk. Risk score: 1 (Extreme risk due to proximity, high closing velocity and uncertain lateral alignment)

**Obstacle 30443:** Located in the Rear-left, moving away longitudinally and laterally towards the ego car with distance -6.90 m and 13.18 m. There is no imminent collision risk from this obstacle. Risk score: 5
