### Safety analysis for timestep 6.8s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

**Assumptions and Clarifications:**

* The prompt mentions "adjusted distances" (adjusted_d_long and adjusted_d_lat), but these values are not provided in the scenario context.  Therefore, the analysis will be based on the provided "real distance" values (longitudinal and lateral) as a best approximation.  If adjusted distances become available, the analysis should be re-evaluated.
* Since no ego vehicle dimensions are given, accurate MDC cannot be calculated. The provided MDC risk assessment ranges will be used with the understanding that they are approximations.
*  TTC cannot be precisely calculated without velocity and accurate distance projections. The analysis will infer risk based on provided distances, velocities, and motion descriptions, mapping them to the TTC risk ranges.

### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 30420**
- Distance Risk reason: Far behind and to the left of the ego vehicle, moving further away.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Moving away from ego vehicle.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 30423**
- Distance Risk reason: Relatively far ahead and to the left, slowly approaching longitudinally.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason:  The slow approach and considerable distance suggest ample time to react.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 30424**
- Distance Risk reason:  Far behind and to the left, moving further away.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Moving away from ego vehicle.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 30426**
- Distance Risk reason: Very close in front and to the right, approaching longitudinally.
- Distance safety score: 2
- Time Risk reason: The close proximity and approach suggest a short time to collision.
- Time safety score: 2
- Overall Risk score: 2

- **Obstacle ID: 30438**
- Distance Risk reason:  Far ahead and to the left, moving further away.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Moving away from ego vehicle.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 30441**
- Distance Risk reason: Extremely close behind, almost directly behind, rapidly approaching longitudinally.
- Distance safety score: 1
- Time Risk reason: The extremely close proximity and rapid approach indicate a very high risk of imminent collision.
- Time safety score: 1
- Overall Risk score: 1

- **Obstacle ID: 30443**
- Distance Risk reason: Moderately close behind and to the left, moving slightly away longitudinally but approaching laterally.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: While longitudinally moving away, lateral movement poses some risk.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3
