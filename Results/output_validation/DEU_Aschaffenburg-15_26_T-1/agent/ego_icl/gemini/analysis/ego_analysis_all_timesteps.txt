Obstacle 30420 (Rear-Left):
- Trajectory: Consistently moving away from the ego vehicle both longitudinally and laterally.
- At 6.8s: Longitudinal distance is -13.30m, lateral distance is 8.57m. Relative longitudinal velocity is -0.89 m/s.  Lateral velocity is 0 m/s.
- TTC: Not applicable due to separating longitudinal motion.
- MDC: Large and increasing, indicating no risk.
- Risk: 5 (Negligible Risk)

Obstacle 30423 (Front-Left):
- Trajectory: Gradually approaching the ego vehicle longitudinally, but lateral distance remains large.
- At 6.8s: Longitudinal distance is 13.23m, lateral distance is 20.69m. Relative longitudinal velocity is -0.89 m/s. Lateral velocity is 0 m/s.
- TTC: Longitudinal TTC is not applicable as they are moving apart.
- MDC: Large and relatively stable.
- Risk: 5 (Negligible Risk)

Obstacle 30424 (Rear-Left):
- Trajectory: Consistently moving away from the ego vehicle both longitudinally and laterally.
- At 6.8s: Longitudinal distance is -20.71m, lateral distance is 9.40m. Relative longitudinal velocity is -0.89 m/s. Lateral velocity is 0 m/s.
- TTC: Not applicable due to separating motion.
- MDC: Large and increasing, indicating no risk.
- Risk: 5 (Negligible Risk)

Obstacle 30426 (Front-Right):
- Trajectory: Approaching the ego vehicle longitudinally, lateral distance is relatively stable.
- At 6.8s: Longitudinal distance is 1.30m, lateral distance is -4.11m. Relative longitudinal velocity is -0.89 m/s. Lateral velocity is 0 m/s.
- TTC: Longitudinal TTC is not applicable since they are moving apart.
- MDC:  Around 3.55m (using Pythagorean theorem, considering both distances).
- Risk: 4 (Low Risk)

Obstacle 30438 (Front-Left):
- Trajectory: Moving away from the ego vehicle both longitudinally and laterally.
- At 6.8s: Longitudinal distance is 16.15m, lateral distance is 14.25m. Relative longitudinal velocity is 6.43 m/s. Relative lateral velocity is 2.91 m/s.
- TTC: Longitudinal TTC is 2.51s (16.15/6.43) Lateral TTC is 4.89s (14.25/2.91).
- MDC: Large.
- Risk: 4 (Low Risk) - due to TTC.

Obstacle 30441 (Behind):
- Trajectory: Rapidly approaching the ego vehicle, appearing to overtake, from the rear.
- At 6.8s: Longitudinal distance is -1.17m, lateral distance is 0.00m. Relative longitudinal velocity is 4.50 m/s. Relative lateral velocity is -4.19 m/s.
- TTC: Longitudinal TTC is 0.26s (-1.17/4.50). Lateral TTC is not applicable as they are perfectly aligned longitudinally.
- MDC: 1.17m.
- Risk: 2 (High Risk) due to very low TTC and close proximity. Note: Negative distance indicates the obstacle is just slightly behind the ego vehicle. 

Obstacle 30443 (Rear-Left):
- Trajectory: Moving somewhat away longitudinally, but approaching laterally.
- At 6.8s: Longitudinal distance is -6.90m, lateral distance is 13.18m. Relative longitudinal velocity is -0.65 m/s. Relative lateral velocity is -7.07 m/s.
- TTC: Longitudinal TTC is not applicable due to the separating motion. Lateral TTC is 1.86s (13.18/7.07)
- MDC: Large and slightly increasing.
- Risk: 3 (Medium Risk) due to TTC.
