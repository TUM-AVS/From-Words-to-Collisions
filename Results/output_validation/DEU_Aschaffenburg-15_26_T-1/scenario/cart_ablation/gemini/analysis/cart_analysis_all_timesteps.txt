At t=7.0s, Ego (ID 30439.0) is at (227.3073, -7.5435) with velocity 0.7495 m/s. Let's analyze the closest obstacles:

* **Obstacle 30441.0:** Located at (223.044, -5.43) in the *same* lanelet (1999) as Ego, traveling at 6.8232 m/s.  The x-positions are close, and both are moving forward with Obstacle 30441.0 approaching Ego quickly from behind. Given the speed differential, there's a chance it could collide with the rear of the Ego vehicle if Ego decelerates or Obstacle 30441.0 does not decelerate. This represents a risk score of 1.
* **Obstacle 30438.0:**  At (252.9291, 2.1686) and moving at 7.8824 m/s. While the y-position suggests it's in a different lane, its x-position is significantly ahead of Ego.  Given the current trajectories and velocities, a collision risk is unlikely.
* **Obstacle 30443.0:**  Located at (219.8933, 8.4937) moving at 7.0572 m/s. This obstacle is further away in the x-direction and the y-separation implies it is not an immediate threat.
* **Obstacles 30420.0, 30423.0, 30424.0, 30426.0:** These obstacles are static and positioned far from Ego, representing no immediate risk.

  "ScenarioAnalysis": {
    "IsCollisionScenario": false,
    "Reasoning": "Obstacle 30441.0 poses an extreme risk (score 1) due to its high closing velocity while approaching Ego from behind within the same lanelet. No immediate collision is detected, but rapid deceleration or continued close following by Obstacle 30441.0 could lead to a collision."
