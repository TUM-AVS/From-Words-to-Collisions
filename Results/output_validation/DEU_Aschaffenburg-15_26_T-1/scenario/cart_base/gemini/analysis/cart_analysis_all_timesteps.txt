Obstacle 30441 is in the same lanelet (1999) as the ego vehicle and is rapidly approaching from behind.  While the deceleration of 30441 is significant at -0.1225, its current velocity of 6.8232 and proximity to the ego vehicle (which is decelerating more strongly) suggests a very high risk of collision in the next few timesteps.
