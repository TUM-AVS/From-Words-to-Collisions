### Safety Analysis for the Most Recent Timestep (7.0 seconds):

#### Key Observations:
1. **Ego Vehicle**: 
   - Position: (227.3073, -7.5435)
   - Velocity: 0.7495 m/s (decelerating)
   - Lanelet: 1999.0

2. **Obstacle Analysis**:
   - Most obstacles are either stationary or moving away from the ego's path
   - Only a few obstacles are in proximity to the ego's lanelet (1999.0)

### Detailed Obstacle Analysis (Most Critical Only):

1. **Obstacle 30441**:
   - Position: (223.044, -5.43) - close to ego's Y position
   - Velocity: 6.8232 m/s (approaching from behind)
   - Lanelet: 1999.0 (same as ego)
   - Distance: ~4.3m longitudinally, ~2.1m laterally
   - TTC: ~0.63s (critical)
   - **Overall Risk Score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)

2. **Obstacle 30443**:
   - Position: (219.8933, 8.4937)
   - Moving away from ego's path
   - **Overall Risk Score**: 3 (Medium Risk)

3. **Obstacle 30426**:
   - Position: (231.1382, -14.5982)
   - Stationary obstacle
   - Safe distance (~4m ahead)
   - **Overall Risk Score**: 4 (Low Risk)

4. Other obstacles are either too far away or moving in non-conflicting directions.

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. Ego is decelerating (velocity decreasing)
2. Only Obstacle 30441 is in the same lanelet and approaching from behind
3. TTC is critical but not immediate collision (0.63s)
4. No actual collision detected in current timestep
5. Scenario requires urgent attention but no collision yet
