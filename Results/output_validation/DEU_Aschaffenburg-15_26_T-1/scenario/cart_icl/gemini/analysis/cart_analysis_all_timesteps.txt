- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Stationary.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 30423.0
- Distance Risk reason: Far from ego, no trajectory intersection.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Stationary.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 30424.0
- Distance Risk reason: Far from ego, no trajectory intersection.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Stationary.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 30426.0
- Distance Risk reason: Far from ego, no trajectory intersection.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Stationary.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 30438.0
- Distance Risk reason: Moving away from ego, different lanelets.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Moving faster than ego in different direction.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 30441.0
- Distance Risk reason: In the same lanelet as the ego vehicle and approaching. Lateral distance is concerning as ego's Y is decreasing while this obstacle's Y is significantly decreasing, showing a potential lateral movement into ego's path.
- Distance safety score: 2
- Time Risk reason: Obstacle closing in on ego, deceleration might not be enough.
- Time safety score: 2
- Overall Risk score: 2

- Obstacle ID: 30443.0
- Distance Risk reason: Far from ego, no trajectory intersection.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Moving in different direction.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5



### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
Obstacle 30441 is showing a high risk. Both its X and Y positions are indicating closing distance, the Y particularly due to its significant decrease. The decelerations observed in the history of data don't fully guarantee safety.

### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
  "CollisionObstacles": null,
  "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null,
  "ScenarioAnalysis": {
    "IsCollisionScenario": false,
    "Reasoning": "No obstacle has a risk score of 0 (collision). Obstacle 30441 presents a high risk (score 2) due to its proximity and trajectory relative to the ego vehicle but isn't an immediate collision threat."
  }
}
