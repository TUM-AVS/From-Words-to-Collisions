### Obstacle Analysis at the Most Recent Timestep (7.0 seconds):

1. **Obstacle ID: 30420.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: This obstacle has been stationary across all timesteps and is located in a different lanelet (1725) from the ego vehicle, indicating no immediate threat.
   - **Distance safety score**: 5
   - **Time Risk reason**: No movement or acceleration, showing no progression towards the ego's path.
   - **Time safety score**: 5
   - **Overall Risk score**: 5

2. **Obstacle ID: 30423.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Consistently stationary in a different lanelet (393), far from the ego vehicle's path.
   - **Distance safety score**: 5
   - **Time Risk reason**: Zero velocity throughout, meaning no risk of moving into the ego's path.
   - **Time safety score**: 5
   - **Overall Risk score**: 5

3. **Obstacle ID: 30424.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Remained stationary in lanelet 1725, away from the ego vehicle.
   - **Distance safety score**: 5
   - **Time Risk reason**: No velocity or acceleration, no trend towards a collision.
   - **Time safety score**: 5
   - **Overall Risk score**: 5

4. **Obstacle ID: 30426.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Located far from the ego's trajectory in lanelet 912.
   - **Distance safety score**: 5
   - **Time Risk reason**: Remained stationary, posing no threat due to lack of movement.
   - **Time safety score**: 5
   - **Overall Risk score**: 5
   
5. **Obstacle ID: 30438.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Continues to move in its path away from the ego, in a different lanelet (1319), with consistent high velocity.
   - **Distance safety score**: 4
   - **Time Risk reason**: The path and velocity do not intersect with the ego, consistent acceleration shows no changing threat.
   - **Time safety score**: 4
   - **Overall Risk score**: 4

6. **Obstacle ID: 30441.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: This obstacle is now in the same lanelet as the ego and moving in a potentially concerning direction; close observation is needed.
   - **Distance safety score**: 2
   - **Time Risk reason**: Moderate velocity with some deceleration might indicate future risks; however, relative speeds show manageable threat.
   - **Time safety score**: 3
   - **Overall Risk score**: 3

7. **Obstacle ID: 30443.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Located in a different lanelet (1994) and moving away, reducing any immediate threat.
   - **Distance safety score**: 4
   - **Time Risk reason**: Although it was moving towards the ego initially, its change of direction and relatively low acceleration reduces future collision risk.
   - **Time safety score**: 4
   - **Overall Risk score**: 4

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
Upon analysis, none of the obstacles present a risk score of 0 (collision). However, obstacle 30441.0 is in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle now, indicating the highest risk, although it's still manageable. The relative velocities are considered moderate, and the ego's deceleration suggests awareness and response capability. Thus, this is not a collision scenario but needs continued monitoring.
