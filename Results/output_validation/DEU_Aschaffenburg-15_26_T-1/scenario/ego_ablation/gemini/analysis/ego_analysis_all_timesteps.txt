Obstacle 30441 is behind the ego vehicle and poses a high risk. It is very close longitudinally (-0.17m) and although it has a lateral offset, its high closing velocity (5.27 m/s longitudinally, -3.22 m/s laterally), suggests a possible lane change maneuver into the ego vehicle's lane is underway or imminent.  This needs immediate attention. The MDC is less than 0.5m and TTC is less than 0.5s, indicating extreme risk.

Obstacle 30426 is in front of the ego vehicle and poses a medium risk. At a longitudinal distance of 1.08m and closing velocity of 0.75 m/s, it is approaching the ego vehicle but still allows some time to react. However continuous monitoring is required to avoid potential collision. The MDC is less than 1.0m and the TTC is between 0.5s and 1.0s, indicating a high risk from this obstacle.

    "IsCollisionScenario": false,
    "Reasoning": "Obstacle 30441 poses an extreme risk with a very high probability of collision due to its proximity, closing velocity, and potential lane change maneuver. Obstacle 30426 poses a high risk due to its proximity and closing velocity. While other obstacles are relatively close, they are moving away from the ego vehicle or have sufficient distance and low relative velocities to be considered low risk.  The scenario is considered high risk due to the presence of Obstacle 30441."
