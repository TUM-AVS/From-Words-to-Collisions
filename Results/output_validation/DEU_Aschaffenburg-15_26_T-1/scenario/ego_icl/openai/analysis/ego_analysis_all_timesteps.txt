Let's analyze the scenario at the most recent timestep (7.0 seconds), focusing on the adjusted distances and trajectories to determine the collision risk for each obstacle.

### Obstacle 30420 Analysis:
- **Position**: Rear-left
- **Adjusted Distances**: Longitudinal -13.41 m, Lateral 8.68 m
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal -0.75 m/s (moving away), no lateral movement
- **TTC Calculation**: Not relevant, as the obstacle is moving away in the longitudinal direction
- **MDC Calculation**: Both distances are greater than 5.0 meters
- **Risk Score**: 5 (No Risk)

### Obstacle 30423 Analysis:
- **Position**: Front-left
- **Adjusted Distances**: Longitudinal 13.19 m, Lateral 20.58 m
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal -0.75 m/s (moving toward), no lateral movement
- **TTC Calculation**: Not relevant as distance is large (and increasing as vehicle is approaching)
- **MDC Calculation**: Both distances are greater than 5.0 meters
- **Risk Score**: 5 (No Risk)

### Obstacle 30424 Analysis:
- **Position**: Rear-left
- **Adjusted Distances**: Longitudinal -20.82 m, Lateral 9.56 m
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal -0.75 m/s (moving away), no lateral movement
- **TTC Calculation**: Not relevant, as the obstacle is moving away in the longitudinal direction
- **MDC Calculation**: Both distances are greater than 5.0 meters
- **Risk Score**: 5 (No Risk)

### Obstacle 30426 Analysis:
- **Position**: Front-right
- **Adjusted Distances**: Longitudinal 1.08 m, Lateral -4.15 m
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal -0.75 m/s (moving toward), no lateral movement
- **TTC Calculation**: \(TTC = \frac{1.08}{0.75} = 1.44\) seconds
- **MDC Calculation**: Longitudinal direction < 3.0 meters
- **Risk Score**: 3 (Medium Risk)

### Obstacle 30438 Analysis:
- **Position**: Front-left
- **Adjusted Distances**: Longitudinal 17.55 m, Lateral 14.65 m
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal 6.69 m/s, Lateral 2.59 m/s (both moving away)
- **TTC Calculation**: Not approaching, hence no TTC
- **MDC Calculation**: Both distances are greater than 5.0 meters
- **Risk Score**: 5 (No Risk)

### Obstacle 30441 Analysis:
- **Position**: Behind
- **Adjusted Distances**: Longitudinal -0.17 m, Lateral 0.00 m (exact alignment)
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal 5.27 m/s (moving toward)
- **TTC Calculation**: Direct calculation challenging as distance is extremely small and alignment exact
- **MDC Calculation**: Approximate MDC = 0 meters
- **Risk Score**: 0 (Collision occurring)

### Obstacle 30443 Analysis:
- **Position**: Rear-left
- **Adjusted Distances**: Longitudinal -6.96 m, Lateral 11.83 m
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal -0.62 m/s (moving away), lateral moving toward
- **TTC Calculation**: Not relevant as the obstacle moves away longitudinally
- **MDC Calculation**: Both distances are greater than 5.0 meters
- **Risk Score**: 5 (No Risk)

### Conclusion
At the most recent timestep, Obstacle 30441 presents a collision scenario based on its immediate proximity (exact lateral alignment) and significant closing velocity. Given the adjusted distances, this obstacle is considered in a collision state.
