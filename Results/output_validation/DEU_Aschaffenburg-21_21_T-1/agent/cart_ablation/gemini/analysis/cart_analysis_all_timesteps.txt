Here's the collision risk analysis:

**Obstacle 30277:** This obstacle is in a different lane and its y-coordinate is consistently far from the ego vehicle's y-coordinate, indicating no immediate risk of collision. Risk score: 5.

**Obstacle 30280:**  This obstacle is also in a different lane.  While its y-coordinate is closer to the ego vehicle than Obstacle 30277, the trajectories suggest no imminent collision risk. Risk score: 4.

**Obstacle 30281:** This obstacle starts in a different lane but moves closer to the ego vehicle's lane over time. However, the x and y coordinates don't indicate an immediate collision risk. Risk score: 4.

**Obstacle 30285:** This obstacle is stationary in the same lane as the ego vehicle, but its x-coordinate is consistently ahead of the ego vehicle and remains so throughout the provided timeframe. It poses no immediate collision risk. Risk score: 4.

**Obstacle 30288:**  This obstacle is in the same lane as the ego vehicle, and behind it, but moving towards it with a decreasing velocity. While the distance between the vehicles is decreasing, the rate is not high enough to warrant an extreme risk classification. Risk score: 3.
