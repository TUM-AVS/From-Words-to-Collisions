Obstacle 30277: This obstacle is in a different lanelet and its trajectory does not appear to intersect with the ego vehicle's path in the near future.  Risk score: 5 (Negligible Risk)

Obstacle 30280: This obstacle is also in a different lanelet and moving away from the ego vehicle. Risk score: 5 (Negligible Risk)

Obstacle 30281: This obstacle is in a different lanelet initially but transitions to lanelet 321. While it's getting closer laterally to the ego vehicle (lanelet 322), it doesn't pose an immediate collision risk based on the provided data. Its trajectory needs further monitoring. Risk score: 4 (Low risk initially, may increase to 3 in the future, but not within the evaluated timeframe).

Obstacle 30285: This obstacle is stationary in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle, and directly ahead. Given the ego vehicle's decreasing velocity, this is a high risk for collision if the ego vehicle doesn't brake sufficiently.  Risk score: 2 (High Risk)

Obstacle 30288: This obstacle is in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle but behind it.  It's moving slower than the ego vehicle initially, and its position relative to the ego vehicle isn't cause for immediate concern. Risk score: 5 (Negligible Risk initially, requires further monitoring).
