Obstacle 30281 is moving towards the ego vehicle's lane and shows a risk of cutting in. Although the current lateral distance is somewhat safe, the continuous lane change and higher velocity compared to the ego vehicle raise concerns. Obstacle 30285 is static and in the ego vehicle's lane, requiring attention. However, given the current distance and ego vehicle's low speed, it poses a medium risk. Obstacle 30288 is also in the same lane as the ego vehicle and moving slightly faster but decelerating. It's relatively close but the consistent deceleration suggests the risk is manageable.  Obstacle 30277, 30280  are far away from the ego and not an immediate concern.
