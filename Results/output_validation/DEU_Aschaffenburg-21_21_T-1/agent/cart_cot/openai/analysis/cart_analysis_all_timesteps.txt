### Analysis:

**Collision or Extreme Risk (Risk Scores 0, 1):**

1. **Obstacle 30285.0 at 6.2 seconds:**
   - **Position:** (276.457, 304.5122)
   - **Velocity:** 0.0 m/s (stationary)
   - **Ego Position:** (279.1518, 300.5668)
   - **Distance to Ego:** Approx. 4.63 units
   - **Lanelet:** Same as Ego (322.0)
   - **Explanation:** This obstacle is stationary and located very close to the ego vehicle in the same lanelet, increasing the risk of a collision if ego continues without adjusting its path.

2. **Obstacle 30288.0 at 6.2 seconds:**
   - **Position:** (286.4935, 289.8188)
   - **Velocity:** 1.9864 m/s
   - **Distance to Ego:** Approx. 11.77 units
   - **Lanelet:** Same as Ego (322.0)
   - **Explanation:** This obstacle shares the same lanelet with the ego vehicle and is approaching from behind with a decreasing velocity. Although there is some separation, the potential trajectory overlap creates a proximity risk, but it's mitigated since the obstacle is slowing down.

### Explanation for High Risk:
- **Obstacle 30281.0:**
  - **Position at 6.2 seconds:** (275.384, 299.8024)
  - **Velocity:** 8.4073 m/s
  - **Heading towards Ego:** Veering closer from a perpendicular approach, showing potential for high-speed lane entry that could intersect with the ego's path if the ego speeds up.
