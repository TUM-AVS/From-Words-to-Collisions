Obstacle 30285 is stationary in the same lane as the ego vehicle and poses a collision risk if the ego vehicle does not brake or change lanes. The distance between the ego vehicle and obstacle 30285 is decreasing, and the ego vehicle's velocity is also decreasing but not quickly enough to avoid a collision within the next timestep. Therefore, obstacle 30285 is considered an immediate collision risk.

Obstacle 30281 is in a different lane but is moving towards the ego vehicle's lane. While it does not pose an immediate collision risk, its trajectory and relatively high velocity suggest a potential risk in the near future if both vehicles maintain their current courses. This obstacle requires careful monitoring.

Obstacle 30288 is behind and to the side of the ego vehicle. While not an immediate risk, it is in the same lane and is moving towards the ego vehicle and needs close monitoring.
