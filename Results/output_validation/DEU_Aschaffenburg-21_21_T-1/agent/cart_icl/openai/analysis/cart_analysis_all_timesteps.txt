For this analysis, we shall begin by examining each obstacle relative to the ego vehicle at the most recent timestep, 6.2 seconds, with earlier timesteps offering insight into motion trends. The objective is to determine collision risk levels, primarily focusing on obstacles with a risk score of 0 or 1.

### Initial Observations & Calculations:

1. **Obstacle 30277.0:**
   - Relative Position to Ego: Difference in x ≈ 279.1518 - 257.9923 = 21.1595; in y ≈ 300.5668 - 303.639 = -3.0722.
   - Closed in over time but still maintains a considerable lateral distance (>3 meters), providing some cushion despite a relatively high velocity (7.4756 m/s).
   - Both longitudinal and lateral relative distances suggest manageable risk.
   - Risk Level: 4 (Low Risk)

2. **Obstacle 30280.0:**
   - Relative Position to Ego: Difference in x ≈ 279.1518 - 257.0076 = 22.1442; in y ≈ 300.5668 - 307.1785 = -6.6117.
   - Still closing in but remains laterally distant by a substantial margin.
   - Given the trend in position change, no immediate collision is imminent.
   - Risk Level: 5 (Negligible Risk)

3. **Obstacle 30281.0:**
   - Relative Position to Ego: Difference in x ≈ 279.1518 - 275.384 = 3.7678; in y ≈ 300.5668 - 299.8024 = 0.7644.
   - Positioned ahead and decreasing distance closer throughout steps, especially in its lane maneuvering towards ego. Continues to have a higher speed (8.4073 m/s).
   - Short MDC and closing speed indicates potential for immediate action.
   - Risk Level: 2 (High Risk)

4. **Obstacle 30285.0:**
   - Stationary within the same lanelet as the ego. Ego approaches but maintains a mitigating pace with relative distance providing adequate response time if further deceleration occurs.
   - Risk Level: 3 (Medium Risk)

5. **Obstacle 30288.0:**
   - Relative Position to Ego: Difference in x ≈ 279.1518 - 286.4935 = -7.3417; in y ≈ 300.5668 - 289.8188 = 10.748.
   - On the course in the same lanelet, but ego seems to be slowing further; maintaining safety without accelerated risk.
   - Risk Level: 3 (Medium Risk)

### Conclusion:

**Overall, based on trends in velocity, acceleration, and position in relation to the ego vehicle, only Obstacle 30281.0 poses immediate risk considerations due to its speed and trajectory.**
