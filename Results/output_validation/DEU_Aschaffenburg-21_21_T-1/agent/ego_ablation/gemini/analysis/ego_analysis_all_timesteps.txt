At the most recent timestamp (6.2 seconds), the following analysis holds:

* **Obstacle 30277:** This obstacle is located 9.98m longitudinally and 14.12m laterally from the ego vehicle, posing no immediate threat.  It is moving towards the ego vehicle both longitudinally and laterally, but the distances and relative velocities suggest ample time to react. Risk score: 5 (Negligible Risk).

* **Obstacle 30280:**  This obstacle is 13.45m longitudinally and 12.93m laterally away from the ego vehicle, and is moving slightly towards the ego longitudinally while moving away laterally. No immediate risk. Risk score: 5 (Negligible Risk)

* **Obstacle 30281:** This obstacle is positioned laterally adjacent to the ego vehicle (1.93m) and is moving towards the ego. Given the lateral proximity and the negative longitudinal relative velocity, this obstacle presents a high risk. Risk score: 2 (High Risk)

* **Obstacle 30285:** Located directly ahead at a very close longitudinal distance of 0.27m.  This represents an extremely high risk of collision given the proximity and negative relative longitudinal velocity. Risk score: 1 (Extreme Risk)

* **Obstacle 30288:** This obstacle is behind the ego vehicle (-8.51m longitudinally) and poses no risk.  It is approaching from behind, but the distance and relative velocity indicate that there is sufficient time and space for maneuvering. Risk score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
