Obstacle 30277: Front-left, longitudinal distance 9.98m, lateral distance 14.12m, moving towards ego car both longitudinally and laterally. This obstacle poses a low risk (4 or 5) given the substantial distances.

Obstacle 30280: Front-left, longitudinal distance 13.45m, lateral distance 12.93m, moving away laterally. This obstacle poses a low risk (4 or 5) due to the large distances.

Obstacle 30281: Left, longitudinal distance 0.00m, lateral distance 1.93m, moving towards ego car laterally.  While the longitudinal alignment suggests a passing maneuver, the close lateral distance represents a high risk (2) of collision.

Obstacle 30285: Front, longitudinal distance 0.27m, approaching ego longitudinally. This extremely close longitudinal distance represents an extreme risk (1) of collision.

Obstacle 30288: Behind, longitudinal distance -8.51m, approaching ego from behind. This obstacle poses a low risk (4 or 5) given the distance.


Risk Levels:
0: Collision - Physical contact occurred or unavoidable
1: Extreme Risk - Immediate collision likely
2: High Risk - Close to collision, needs quick action
3: Medium Risk - Manageable with proper reaction
4: Low Risk - Minimal risk, sufficient time to react
5: Negligible Risk - No significant risk
