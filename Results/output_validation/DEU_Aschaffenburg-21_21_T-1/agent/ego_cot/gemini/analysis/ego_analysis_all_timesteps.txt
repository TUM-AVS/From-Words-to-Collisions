### Safety analysis for timestep 6.2s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

**- Obstacle ID: 30277**
- Distance Risk reason: Located at 9.98m longitudinal and 9.98m lateral distance in the front-left of the ego vehicle, posing no immediate collision risk.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason:  The relative velocity suggests it is slowly moving towards the ego vehicle both longitudinally and laterally, but the large distance provides ample time to react.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

**- Obstacle ID: 30280**
- Distance Risk reason: positioned 13.45m longitudinally and 13.45m laterally in the front-left, far from the ego vehicle.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Moving away laterally to the left and slightly towards the ego longitudinally, but with a safe distance and speed differential.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

**- Obstacle ID: 30281**
- Distance Risk reason:  At 0.00m longitudinal and 0.00m lateral distance on the left of the ego vehicle, there is high risk of a collision.
- Distance safety score: 0
- Time Risk reason: The relative velocity indicates a fast approach towards the ego vehicle longitudinally.
- Time safety score: 0
- Overall Risk score: 0

**- Obstacle ID: 30285**
- Distance Risk reason: At 0.27m longitudinal and 0.27m lateral distance in front, it poses an extreme risk of an immediate collision.
- Distance safety score: 1
- Time Risk reason: The relative longitudinal velocity shows the obstacle moving towards the ego vehicle, increasing the imminence of collision.
- Time safety score: 1
- Overall Risk score: 1

**- Obstacle ID: 30288**
- Distance Risk reason: Located at -8.51m longitudinal and -8.51m lateral distance behind the ego vehicle. The negative sign indicates it's behind the ego vehicle, not posing any immediate risk.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: It is moving towards the ego vehicle longitudinally from behind, but given the distance and relative speed, there's sufficient time to react.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5
