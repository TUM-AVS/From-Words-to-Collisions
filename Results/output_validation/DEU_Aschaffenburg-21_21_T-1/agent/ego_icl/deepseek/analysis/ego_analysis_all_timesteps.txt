Let me analyze each obstacle at the most recent timestep (6.2 seconds) and assess collision risks:

1. Obstacle 30277 (Front-left):
   - Adjusted distances: longitudinal 9.98m, lateral 14.12m
   - Relative velocities: longitudinal -0.28m/s (approaching), lateral -7.47m/s (approaching)
   - TTC longitudinal: 9.98/0.28 = 35.64s (No Risk)
   - TTC lateral: 14.12/7.47 = 1.89s (Medium Risk)
   - MDC: Lateral distance is primary concern (14.12m > 5m â†’ No Risk)
   - Overall Risk: Medium (3) - lateral approach but large distance

2. Obstacle 30280 (Front-left):
   - Adjusted distances: longitudinal 13.45m, lateral 12.93m
   - Relative velocities: longitudinal -0.05m/s (approaching), lateral 5.58m/s (moving away)
   - TTC longitudinal: 13.45/0.05 = 269s (No Risk)
   - TTC lateral: Not applicable (moving away)
   - MDC: Both distances increasing (No Risk)
   - Overall Risk: No Risk (5)

3. Obstacle 30281 (Left):
   - Critical obstacle - exact longitudinal alignment (0.00m)
   - Adjusted distances: longitudinal 0.00m, lateral 1.93m
   - Relative velocities: longitudinal -8.55m/s (passed), lateral -0.14m/s (approaching)
   - TTC longitudinal: Already passed (0s - Collision Risk)
   - TTC lateral: 1.93/0.14 = 13.79s (No Risk)
   - MDC: Lateral distance 1.93m (Medium Risk)
   - Overall Risk: Collision (0) - already passed longitudinally at close proximity

4. Obstacle 30285 (Front):
   - Adjusted distances: longitudinal 0.27m, lateral 0.00m
   - Relative velocities: longitudinal -0.15m/s (approaching), lateral 0.00m/s
   - TTC longitudinal: 0.27/0.15 = 1.8s (Medium Risk)
   - TTC lateral: N/A (aligned)
   - MDC: Longitudinal distance 0.27m (High Risk)
   - Overall Risk: High (2) - very close front obstacle but slow approach

5. Obstacle 30288 (Behind):
   - Adjusted distances: longitudinal -8.51m, lateral 0.00m
   - Relative velocities: longitudinal 1.84m/s (approaching), lateral 0.00m/s
   - TTC longitudinal: 8.51/1.84 = 4.62s (Low Risk)
   - TTC lateral: N/A (aligned)
   - MDC: Longitudinal distance 8.51m (No Risk)
   - Overall Risk: Low (4)

Trajectory Analysis:
- Obstacle 30281 shows the most critical behavior, having already passed the ego vehicle longitudinally at very close proximity (0m longitudinal, 1.93m lateral)
- Obstacle 30285 is the next highest risk with very close frontal proximity (0.27m)
- Other obstacles either have large distances or diverging paths

JSON Summary:
```json
{
    "CollisionObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "30281",
        "OverallRiskScore": "0"
    },
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "30285",
        "OverallRiskScore": "2"
    },
    "PredictedCollisionObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "30281",
        "OverallRiskScore": "0"
    }
}
```

Note: While Obstacle 30281 has already passed longitudinally (collision risk 0), there is no extreme risk (score 1) obstacle currently. The next highest risk is Obstacle 30285 with High Risk (score 2).
