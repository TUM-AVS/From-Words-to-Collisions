**Obstacle Analysis:**

### Obstacle 30277 (Front-left)
- **Position and Motion:**
  - Adjusted longitudinal distance: 9.98 meters
  - Adjusted lateral distance: 14.12 meters
  - Relative velocity longitudinal: -0.28 m/s
  - Relative velocity lateral: -7.47 m/s
  - The obstacle is converging diagonally towards the ego vehicle.
- **Trajectory Analysis:**
  - Longitudinal distance is decreasing slightly but not critical.
  - Lateral distance is significantly decreasing, indicating lateral convergence.
- **Calculations:**
  - TTC longitudinal (ignoring relative velocity, very high time): Not critical.
  - TTC lateral = 14.12 m / 7.47 m/s ≈ 1.89 seconds
  - MDC longitudinal = 9.98 meters
  - MDC lateral = 14.12 meters
- **Risk Assessment:**
  - TTC lateral indicates a medium risk due to convergence at 1.89 seconds.
  - Overall Risk: Medium Risk (3).

### Obstacle 30280 (Front-left)
- **Position and Motion:**
  - Adjusted longitudinal distance: 13.45 meters
  - Adjusted lateral distance: 12.93 meters
  - Relative velocity longitudinal: -0.05 m/s
  - Relative velocity lateral: 5.58 m/s (diverging)
- **Trajectory Analysis:**
  - The obstacle is converging slightly longitudinally but diverging laterally.
- **Calculations:**
  - TTC longitudinal: High due to low relative velocity, not critical.
  - TTC lateral: Diverging, not a concern.
  - Both MDC values are above critical thresholds.
- **Risk Assessment:**
  - Diverging lateral trajectory implies negligible lateral risk.
  - Overall Risk: Negligible Risk (5).

### Obstacle 30281 (Left)
- **Position and Motion:**
  - Adjusted longitudinal distance: 0.00 meters
  - Adjusted lateral distance: 1.93 meters
  - Relative velocity longitudinal: -8.55 m/s (moving away)
  - Relative velocity lateral: -0.14 m/s
- **Trajectory Analysis:**
  - Exact longitudinal alignment; primarily focus on lateral closing.
- **Calculations:**
  - TTC lateral = 1.93 m / 0.14 m/s ≈ 13.79 seconds
  - MDC longitudinal: 0 meters (aligned)
  - MDC lateral = 1.93 meters
- **Risk Assessment:**
  - Long lateral TTC indicates low converging risk.
  - Overall Risk: Low Risk (4).

### Obstacle 30285 (Front)
- **Position and Motion:**
  - Adjusted longitudinal distance: 0.27 meters
  - Adjusted lateral distance: 0.00 meters
  - Relative velocity longitudinal: -0.15 m/s
- **Trajectory Analysis:**
  - Exact lateral alignment with very close longitudinal distance.
- **Calculations:**
  - TTC longitudinal = 0.27 m / 0.15 m/s ≈ 1.8 seconds
  - MDC longitudinal = 0.27 meters
  - Extremely close proximity indicates high risk.
- **Risk Assessment:**
  - Close distance and low TTC indicates a high risk of collision.
  - Overall Risk: Extreme Risk (1).

### Obstacle 30288 (Behind)
- **Position and Motion:**
  - Adjusted longitudinal distance: -8.51 meters
  - Adjusted lateral distance: 0.00 meters
  - Relative velocity longitudinal: 1.84 m/s (approaching)
- **Trajectory Analysis:**
  - Approaching from behind with same-lane alignment.
- **Calculations:**
  - TTC longitudinal = 8.51 m / 1.84 m/s ≈ 4.62 seconds
  - MDC longitudinal = 8.51 meters
- **Risk Assessment:**
  - Approaching but with sufficient time, low risk.
  - Overall Risk: Low Risk (4).

**Summary:**

```json
{
  "CollisionObstacle": {
    "ObstacleID": null,
    "OverallRiskScore": null
  },
  "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {
    "ObstacleID": "30285",
    "OverallRiskScore": "1"
  },
  "HighRiskObstacle": {
