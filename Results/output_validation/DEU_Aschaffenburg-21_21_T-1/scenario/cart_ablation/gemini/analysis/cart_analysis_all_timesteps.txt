At t=6.4s, the ego vehicle at (279.1349, 300.5916) in lanelet 322 has several obstacles nearby.  Obstacle 30285 at (276.457, 304.5122) is also in lanelet 322 and is stationary. Given the positions and ego's slow velocity, there is a possible collision risk with obstacle 30285. The y-coordinate difference is approximately 4, suggesting a likely collision if the ego vehicle continues on its current trajectory.  Although obstacle 30281 is approaching rapidly in the adjacent lanelet 321, it does not pose an immediate risk at this timestep due to greater lateral separation. Obstacle 30288, while in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle, is further behind and poses less of an immediate threat. The other obstacles (30277 and 30280) are in different lanelets and are not considered high risk at this time.
