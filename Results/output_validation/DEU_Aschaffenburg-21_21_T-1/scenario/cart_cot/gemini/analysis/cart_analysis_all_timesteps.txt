### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 30277.0
- Distance Risk reason: This obstacle is in a different lanelet and far from the ego vehicle. Its trajectory over the past timesteps shows it moving further away.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason:  The obstacle's velocity and acceleration are not relevant to the ego vehicle due to the lateral separation and different lanelets.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 30280.0
- Distance Risk reason: This obstacle is in a different lanelet and poses no immediate threat.  Its trajectory shows it moving somewhat parallel to but further away from the ego vehicle.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: While the obstacle has significant velocity, its trajectory and lanelet position indicate no risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 30281.0
- Distance Risk reason: This obstacle is in a different lanelet, but closer laterally than 30277 and 30280.  Analyzing its trajectory, it remains in a different lane and does not appear to be crossing into the ego vehicle's path.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Though it has high velocity, the lateral separation and separate lanelet mitigate the risk.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- Obstacle ID: 30285.0
- Distance Risk reason: This static obstacle is ahead of the ego vehicle in the same lanelet, but at a safe distance.  The historical data confirms it has not moved.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: The obstacle is stationary, therefore presenting no immediate time-related risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 4

- Obstacle ID: 30288.0
- Distance Risk reason: This obstacle is behind the ego vehicle in the same lanelet and moving slower. Its trajectory confirms its position behind and its slowing relative speed.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Although in the same lanelet, the obstacle is moving away and decelerating.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5


### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. **Most critical obstacles:** Initially, obstacle 30285.0 (static, same lanelet, ahead of ego) and 30288.0 (same lanelet, behind ego) seemed most critical due to lane sharing.  
2. **Trajectory analysis:** Over the 10 timesteps, 30285.0 remained static and posed no threat. Obstacle 30288.0 remained behind the ego vehicle, gradually decelerating and moving further behind, thus mitigating risk. Obstacle 30281.0, while in a nearby lane and with higher velocity, maintains its lane and doesn't pose a collision risk.
3. **Relative positions, velocities, and accelerations:** The ego vehicle is slowly decelerating. The relative velocities and positions of all obstacles, when considered with their historical trajectories, indicate no imminent collision risk.
4. **Collision determination:** No collision has occurred or is imminent based on the provided data.
5. **Reasoning:** The analysis of historical data indicates all obstacles are either moving away from the ego vehicle, maintaining a safe distance, or are in separate lanelets with no intersecting trajectories.
