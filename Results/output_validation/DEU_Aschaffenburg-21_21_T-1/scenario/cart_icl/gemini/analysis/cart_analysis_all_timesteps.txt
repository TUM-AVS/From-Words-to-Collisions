### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 30277.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is far from ego and in a different lane.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason:  No immediate time-based risk due to different lanes.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 30280.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is far from ego and in a different lane.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: No immediate time-based risk due to different lanes.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 30281.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is in a different lane but relatively close. Lateral distance is decreasing.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Obstacle's lateral velocity suggests it might move closer but unlikely to collide within a short timeframe.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- Obstacle ID: 30285.0
- Distance Risk reason:  Static obstacle in the same lane and relatively close to the ego vehicle.
- Distance safety score: 2
- Time Risk reason: Ego vehicle is moving slowly towards the static obstacle.
- Time safety score: 2
- Overall Risk score: 2

- Obstacle ID: 30288.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is behind the ego vehicle and in the same lane, but separated by a safe distance.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Both vehicles are moving in the same direction, and obstacle's speed is decreasing.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4


### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
No immediate collision detected. However, Obstacle 30285 poses a high risk due to its static nature and the ego vehicle's approach.  Obstacle 30281 requires monitoring due to decreasing lateral distance.
