### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

1. **Obstacle ID: 30277.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason:** The obstacle is in a different lanelet and is moving fairly parallel and away from the ego vehicle, with a consistent trajectory.
   - **Distance safety score:** 4
   - **Time Risk reason:** Constant velocity and trajectory indicate a steady path away from the ego vehicle.
   - **Time safety score:** 5
   - **Overall Risk score:** 4.5

2. **Obstacle ID: 30280.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason:** Positioned in a different lanelet with a reducing velocity trend indicating distancing from the ego vehicle.
   - **Distance safety score:** 4
   - **Time Risk reason:** Consistent negative acceleration suggests it is slowing down, maintaining a safe margin.
   - **Time safety score:** 5
   - **Overall Risk score:** 4.5

3. **Obstacle ID: 30281.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason:** Approaching the ego vehicle's lanelet but maintains a clear path due to its trajectory.
   - **Distance safety score:** 3
   - **Time Risk reason:** High velocity but on a trajectory that avoids collision courses directly.
   - **Time safety score:** 3
   - **Overall Risk score:** 3

4. **Obstacle ID: 30285.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason:** Stationary at a very close distance within the same lanelet as the ego vehicle.
   - **Distance safety score:** 1
   - **Time Risk reason:** Its inactivity (no movement) poses an immediate collision risk if the ego vehicle trajectory isn't altered.
   - **Time safety score:** 1
   - **Overall Risk score:** 1

5. **Obstacle ID: 30288.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason:** Continues to move in its lanelet with a decreasing speed, but given the trajectory, poses no immediate threat.
   - **Distance safety score:** 3
   - **Time Risk reason:** Slight decrease in speed with consistent acceleration doesn't suggest any drift into the ego vehicle's path.
   - **Time safety score:** 3
   - **Overall Risk score:** 3

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
- **Collision Evaluation:** Obstacle 30285.0 poses an immediate collision threat due to its stationary position directly in the path of the ego vehicle.
- **Scenario Conclusion:** This scenario is determined as extreme risk, specifically for Obstacle 30285.0, which requires immediate action to avoid collision.
