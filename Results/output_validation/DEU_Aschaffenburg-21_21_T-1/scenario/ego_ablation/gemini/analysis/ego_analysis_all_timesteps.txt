Obstacle 30285 shows a very high risk of collision with the ego vehicle.  Its longitudinal distance is only 0.24 meters and closing, indicating an imminent frontal collision.  Obstacle 30281 is also a concern due to its close proximity (1.91 meters laterally) and relative longitudinal velocity but it's less critical compared to Obstacle 30285's situation.
