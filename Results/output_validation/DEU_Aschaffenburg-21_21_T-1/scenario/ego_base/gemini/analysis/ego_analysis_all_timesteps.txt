Obstacle 30285 is very close to the ego vehicle longitudinally (0.24m) and has a negative relative velocity, indicating it is moving towards the ego vehicle. Although the relative velocity is small (-0.12 m/s), the proximity makes this obstacle a high risk.

Obstacle 30281 is also very close laterally (1.91m) and has a high negative relative longitudinal velocity (-8.51 m/s) although it has exact longitudinal alignment with the ego vehicle, meaning a potential side collision. While not immediately colliding, the high relative speed and close proximity raise concern.

Obstacle 30288 is approaching the ego vehicle from behind with a moderate relative velocity (1.66 m/s). However, the distance is not critically small (-8.17m), placing it in a lower risk category than the front obstacles.

Obstacle 30277 and 30280 are further away and pose less immediate risk compared to the others.

**Risk Levels and Definitions:**
<Collision (Score: 0)>: Actual collision has occurred or is unavoidable within the next timestep.
<Extreme Risk (Score: 1)>: Immediate collision or very high likelihood of impact. Urgent action is required.
<High Risk (Score: 2)>: Close to collision or highly probable collision path. Needs prompt attention and quick manoeuvring.
<Medium Risk (Score: 3)>: Moderate collision risk but manageable with timely reactions and proper strategies.
<Low Risk (Score: 4)>: Minimal collision risk. The situation is controllable with sufficient time to react.
<Negligible Risk (Score: 5)>: No significant collision risk. Obstacles are either moving away or far enough not to interfere.

  "ScenarioAnalysis": {
    "IsCollisionScenario": false,
    "Reasoning": "Obstacle 30285 poses an extreme risk due to its very close proximity to the ego vehicle and negative relative longitudinal velocity, making a collision highly likely in the next few timesteps.  Obstacle 30281 also poses a high risk given the close lateral distance and high negative relative longitudinal velocity. Although there are other obstacles, these two present the most immediate concern."
