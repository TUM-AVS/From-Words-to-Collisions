### Safety analysis for timestep 5.5-6.4: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

**Methodology:**

Given the data, precise TTC calculation is challenging due to varying accelerations.  A simplified approach assumes constant velocity for a short-term risk assessment.  TTC is approximated as `distance / relative_velocity`. This provides a reasonable estimate for near-term risks.  If relative velocity is zero or near zero, and the distance is small, we assume a very high risk. If the relative velocity is moving away from the ego vehicle, and the distance is substantial, we assume negligible or low risks.  MDC is simply the minimum distance observed during the provided timeframe.  A more robust analysis would incorporate acceleration and predict future trajectories, but we lack the tools for that within this format.


### Obstacle Analysis:

**- Obstacle ID: 30277**
- Distance Risk reason:  Consistently over 9.89m away laterally and longitudinally over the analyzed time steps, placing it relatively far from the ego vehicle.  It is approaching laterally and longitudinally but very slowly.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Although approaching, the slow relative velocity suggests ample time to react.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

**- Obstacle ID: 30280**
- Distance Risk reason:  Located far from the ego vehicle, always greater than 13 meters away both longitudinally and laterally. It is moving further away laterally.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: While it is moving slightly closer longitudinally, the large distance and the fact its lateral motion increases the overall distance means there's substantial time to react.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

**- Obstacle ID: 30281**
- Distance Risk reason: This obstacle presents the most significant threat. It is moving close longitudinally and laterally to the ego car. By t=5.9s, both its longitudinal and lateral distances reach zero, indicating a collision or near miss.
- Distance safety score: 0 (at t=5.9s and t=6.0-6.4)
- Time Risk reason:  The negative relative velocity and decreasing distance lead to a very short TTC, indicating imminent collision.
- Time safety score: 0 (at t=5.9s and t=6.0-6.4)
- Overall Risk score: 0

**- Obstacle ID: 30285**
- Distance Risk reason: This obstacle is very close longitudinally and laterally to the ego car, and the distance continues to decrease across time steps.  It remains very near zero, indicating a very high risk of collision.
- Distance safety score: 1
- Time Risk reason:  The closing velocity and minimal distance suggest a high probability of collision.
- Time safety score: 1
- Overall Risk score: 1

**- Obstacle ID: 30288**
- Distance Risk reason: While located behind the ego vehicle, the decreasing distance needs observation for potential rear-end collisions. However, the relative velocity suggests the ego vehicle is pulling away.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason:  The positive longitudinal relative velocity implies that this obstacle is moving away from the ego vehicle longitudinally.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4
