    - Overall Risk Score: 5

    - Obstacle ID: 30280
    - Relative Direction: Front-left
    - Distance Risk Reason: DTClong and DTClat are both >5m, indicating a safe distance. The trend shows these distances remaining stable over the past timesteps. Lateral distance is increasing, improving safety.
    - Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 5
    - Lateral Distance Safety Score: 5
    - Overall Distance Safety Score: 5
    - Time Risk Reason: TTClong and TTClat are > 5s. The trends over previous timesteps show these values remaining very high.
    - Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 5
    - Lateral Time Safety Score: 5
    - Overall Time Safety Score: 5
    - Overall Risk Score: 5

    - Obstacle ID: 30281
    - Relative Direction: Left
    - Distance Risk Reason: DTClong is 0m and DTClat is <5m, indicating high lateral risk. The trend over the past timesteps shows longitudinal distance decreasing to 0 while lateral distance remains relatively stable around 2m but still less than 5 meters.
    - Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 0
    - Lateral Distance Safety Score: 2
    - Overall Distance Safety Score: 2  (0 * 0 + 2 * (1-0) = 2)
    - Time Risk Reason: TTClong is 0s and TTClat is >5s, representing high longitudinal risk and no lateral risk. Over the past timesteps, TTClong decreased to 0, while TTClat steadily increased.
    - Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 0
    - Lateral Time Safety Score: 5
    - Overall Time Safety Score: 5 (0*0 + 5*(1-0) = 5)
    - Overall Risk Score: 4 (0.5 * 2 + 0.5 * 5 = 3.5, rounded to 4)

    - Obstacle ID: 30285
    - Relative Direction: Front
    - Distance Risk Reason: DTClong is <0.5m indicating extreme risk.  The trend shows decreasing longitudinal distance over the past timesteps, posing an increasing collision risk.
    - Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 1
    - Lateral Distance Safety Score: 0
    - Overall Distance Safety Score: 1 (1*1 + 0*(1-1) = 1)
    - Time Risk Reason: TTClong is between 1 and 3, showing a medium risk longitudinally and TTClat is 0, indicating collision risk. The longitudinal time to collision has been relatively stable near 1.
    - Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 3
    - Lateral Time Safety Score: 0
    - Overall Time Safety Score: 3 (3*1 + 0*(1-1) = 3)
    - Overall Risk Score: 2 (0.5*1 + 0.5*3 = 2)

    - Obstacle ID: 30288
    - Relative Direction: Behind
    - Distance Risk Reason: DTClong is >5m (but negative, indicating behind the ego vehicle), suggesting no longitudinal risk.  Lateral distance is 0m. The longitudinal distance has been increasing in magnitude (more negative) showing that the obstacle behind is getting slightly further away.
    - Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 5
    - Lateral Distance Safety Score: 0
    - Overall Distance Safety Score: 5 (5*1 + 0*(1-1) = 5)
    - Time Risk Reason: TTClong is >3s indicating low risk, and TTClat is 0.  TTClong has been fairly stable around 4 seconds for the previous timesteps.
    - Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 4
    - Lateral Time Safety Score: 0
    - Overall Time Safety Score: 4 (4*1 + 0*(1-1) = 4)
    - Overall Risk Score: 5 (0.5 * 5 + 0.5 * 4 = 4.5, rounded to 5)
