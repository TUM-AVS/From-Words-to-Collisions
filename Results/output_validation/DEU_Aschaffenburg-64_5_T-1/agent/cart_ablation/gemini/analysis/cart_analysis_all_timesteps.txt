Obstacle 30187 is in a different lanelet than the ego vehicle, and the provided data shows no indication of a potential collision.  The distance between the ego vehicle and obstacle 30187 remains relatively large throughout the provided timesteps. Therefore, the risk associated with this obstacle is negligible.

Obstacle 30195 is in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle.  Analyzing the positions over time reveals that the distance between the ego vehicle and obstacle 30195 is decreasing. While a collision hasn't occurred within the provided timeframe, the continuously decreasing distance and the relative velocities suggest a high risk of collision in the near future if the current trajectories are maintained. The ego vehicle's deceleration and the obstacle's slightly fluctuating but overall decreasing speed mitigate the risk somewhat, making it a high risk for now but with the potential to escalate to extreme if these trends persist.
