Obstacle 30187.0 (Lanelet 177): This obstacle is in a different lanelet than the ego vehicle. While the provided data doesn't give lanelet geometry, the positions and orientations suggest the obstacle is moving roughly parallel to the ego vehicle and not directly intersecting its path.  The distance between them remains relatively constant throughout the provided timesteps. Therefore, the risk associated with this obstacle is considered low.

Obstacle 30195.0 (Lanelet 176): This obstacle is in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle and ahead of it.  Critically, the obstacle's y-coordinate is consistently decreasing while the ego vehicle's y-coordinate is also decreasing, indicating they are moving in the same general direction within the lane. While the obstacle's velocity is higher than the ego vehicle's, both are decelerating. The distance between them is shrinking throughout the timeframe, posing a potential risk. Over the ten time steps, the distance between the two vehicles decreases considerably. At t=1.2s, the distance is approximately 8.4 meters, and at t=2.1s, it reduces to about 4.4 meters. Given the continuous approach and deceleration, the risk is deemed high, requiring attention and potential action to avoid a collision in the near future.
