Obstacle 30195 is showing higher risk than obstacle 30187 due to its proximity and same-lane trajectory with the ego vehicle.  Obstacle 30187, while moving, maintains a safe lateral distance in a different lane, posing negligible risk currently.

Focusing on the most recent timestep (2.1 seconds):
* **Ego:** Position (441.6237, 542.8261), Velocity 6.8965,  Acceleration 0.025
* **Obstacle 30187:** Position (451.2305, 536.6888), Velocity 9.0253, Acceleration 0.2984. The lateral separation between the ego and this obstacle suggests no immediate collision risk.
* **Obstacle 30195:** Position (438.2878, 546.9003), Velocity 11.5064, Acceleration -1.7259. While this obstacle is behind the ego vehicle, its higher velocity and closing the distance warrant a higher risk level. Although the obstacle's acceleration is negative, the velocity difference suggests that if this trend continues, a risk of collision might increase in the coming seconds.

Given that no collision is imminent or unavoidable, and no obstacle presents extreme risk, but obstacle 30195 warrants attention due to decreasing distance, we assign risk scores accordingly.
