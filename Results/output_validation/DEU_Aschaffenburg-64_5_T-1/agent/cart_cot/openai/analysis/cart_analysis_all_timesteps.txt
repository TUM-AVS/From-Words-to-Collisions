### Analysis:

At 2.1 seconds:

**Obstacle 30187.0:**

- **Position/Distance to Ego:** Starting from (451.2305, 536.6888) compared to Ego’s (441.6237, 542.8261), indicating it's ahead and slightly to the right of the Ego vehicle.
- **Velocity/Acceleration:** Its velocity is 9.0253 with minor acceleration changes, which indicates a relatively stable forward motion. 
- **Risk Assessment:** Considering the trajectory and distance over the 10 timesteps, there’s no immediate path crossing or significant approach to the Ego vehicle. The trajectory shows maintenance within its lanelet without drastic speed changes relative to Ego. The risk remains low, likely at a 4-5 range.

**Obstacle 30195.0:**

- **Position/Distance to Ego:** Located at (438.2878, 546.9003), close and slightly behind the Ego's path. This proximity presents potential concern especially given shared lanelet (176.0) over the series of timesteps.
- **Velocity/Acceleration:** Maintaining a slightly higher speed close to the Ego’s path but decelerating trends.
- **Risk Assessment:** The close follow and slight alignment within the lanelet without action could lead to a risk of collision if trajectories merge or if the Ego vehicle reduces speed drastically. The risk seems higher, potentially marking this as a high to extreme risk situation due to proximity and shared space. Potential for a score around 2.

The primary concern is with Obstacle 30195.0 given its continual proximity and approximate lane position relative to the Ego, which may pose an imminent risk if trajectories converge, especially with less reactive maneuvers from the Ego.
