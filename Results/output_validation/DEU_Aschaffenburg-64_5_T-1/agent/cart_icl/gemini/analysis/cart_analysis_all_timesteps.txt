At t=2.1s, the ego vehicle is at (441.6237, 542.8261) with a velocity of 6.8965 m/s.

Obstacle 30187 is at (451.2305, 536.6888) with a velocity of 9.0253 m/s. This obstacle is in a different lanelet and poses no immediate risk.  The lateral distance is significant, and although the longitudinal distance is decreasing, the trajectories do not suggest an imminent collision.

Obstacle 30195 is at (438.2878, 546.9003) with velocity 11.5064 m/s. This obstacle is in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle and is slightly behind. The longitudinal distance is -3.3359m (ego ahead). Since the obstacle has a higher velocity, it is closing in.  The relative velocity is 11.5064 - 6.8965 = 4.6099 m/s. This implies a TTC of -3.3359 / 4.6099 = -0.72s. The negative TTC implies that a collision might occur if the ego vehicle maintains its current velocity and the obstacle continues to approach at its current speed. Given they are in the same lanelet, this is cause for concern. It's not an immediate collision given the rate at which they are closing in, but high risk.
