In this analysis, I will evaluate the risks associated with the two obstacles based on their trajectories in relation to the ego vehicle across the provided time steps. I will focus on assessing the overall risk at the most recent time step (2.1 seconds) using key parameters such as relative positions, velocities, and lanelets.

### Analysis

1. **Obstacle 30187.0**:
   - **Position**: At 2.1 seconds, the obstacle is at (451.2305, 536.6888).
   - **Relative Position to Ego**: Approximately 9.61 meters directly along the path, ahead of the ego vehicle.
   - **Lanelet**: 177.0, indicating a parallel lane with no crossing intent.
   - **Velocity**: 9.0253 m/s, moving more or less parallel to ego in a separate lane.
   - **Acceleration**: Minimal influence with 0.2984 m/s².
   - **Risk Evaluation**: The lateral distance is significant (10 units or more), which implies that this obstacle poses a Low Risk (4).

2. **Obstacle 30195.0**:
   - **Position**: At 2.1 seconds, the obstacle is at (438.2878, 546.9003).
   - **Relative Position to Ego**: Approximately 2.23 meters behind the ego vehicle, same lanelet.
   - **Lanelet**: 176.0, in the same lanelet as Ego.
   - **Velocity**: 11.5064 m/s and closing in at a faster rate than the ego vehicle.
   - **Acceleration**: -1.7259 m/s² indicates some deceleration, possibly to maintain safer distance.
   - **Risk Evaluation**: Given the small gap and closing speed, there is a High Risk (2) situation emerging, needing quick adjustments to prevent collision.

Based on this evaluation:

- **Obstacle 30187.0** poses a Low Risk (4) due to its stable distance and separate lane.
- **Obstacle 30195.0** exhibits High Risk (2) due to reduced relative distances and closing velocity despite being decelerating.

### Conclusion

The primary concern is Obstacle 30195.0 in terms of potential risk, with a high but manageable level requiring monitoring.
