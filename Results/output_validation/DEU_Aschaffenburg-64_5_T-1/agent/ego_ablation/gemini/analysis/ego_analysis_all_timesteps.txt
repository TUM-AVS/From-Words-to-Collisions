At t=2.1s, Obstacle 30187 is located 6.39m in front and 1.74m to the left of the ego vehicle, moving towards the ego longitudinally at -15.92 m/s and laterally at 0.19 m/s.  Given the distance and relative velocity, a collision is possible, however not imminent within the next few seconds.  Thus, it represents a medium risk (3).

At t=2.1s, Obstacle 30195 is located -0.76m behind and at the same lateral position as the ego vehicle, and moving towards the ego longitudinally at 4.61 m/s and laterally at 0.13 m/s.  Given the negative longitudinal distance, obstacle 30195 is very close to the ego vehicle and represents a high risk of collision (2).
