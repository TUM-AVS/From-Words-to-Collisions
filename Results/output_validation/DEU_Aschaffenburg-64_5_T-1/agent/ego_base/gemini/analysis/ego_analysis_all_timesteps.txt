* **Obstacle 30187 (Front-left):** This obstacle is approaching the ego vehicle longitudinally at -15.92 m/s and laterally at 0.19 m/s.  The longitudinal distance is only 6.39 meters. Given the high closing velocity and short distance, this obstacle represents a high risk of collision if the ego vehicle doesn't take action. Risk score is 2.

* **Obstacle 30195 (Behind):** This obstacle is approaching from behind with a longitudinal relative velocity of 4.61 m/s and a longitudinal distance of -0.76 m. This is extremely close and indicates a very high probability of collision in the next few moments. Risk score is 1.

0: Collision - Physical contact occurred or unavoidable
1: Extreme Risk - Immediate collision likely
2: High Risk - Close to collision, needs quick action
3: Medium Risk - Manageable with proper reaction
4: Low Risk - Minimal risk, sufficient time to react
5: Negligible Risk - No significant risk
