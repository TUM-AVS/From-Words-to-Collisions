### Safety analysis for timestep 2.1s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

**- Obstacle ID: 30187**
- Distance Risk reason: At 2.1s, Obstacle 30187 is 6.39m longitudinally and 6.39m laterally away from the ego vehicle, located to the front-left.  While the distance is currently greater than the collision thresholds, the continuous approach of the obstacle towards the ego vehicle longitudinally (-15.92 m/s) despite moving slightly away laterally (0.19 m/s) warrants concern.
- Distance safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
- Time Risk reason:  Without precise ego vehicle motion, TTC cannot be precisely calculated. However, given the closing longitudinal velocity and rapidly decreasing distance, a collision risk cannot be ruled out in the near future. The lateral movement slightly away provides a small margin of safety. 
- Time safety score: 3 (Medium Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 3 (Medium Risk)


**- Obstacle ID: 30195**
- Distance Risk reason: At 2.1s, Obstacle 30195 is -0.76m longitudinally and -0.76m laterally from the ego vehicle, very close and located to the behind. This indicates extreme proximity and an extremely high probability of collision. The negative distance is a strong indicator of risk.
- Distance safety score: 1 (Extreme Risk)
- Time Risk reason: The obstacle is approaching from behind with a positive longitudinal velocity (4.61 m/s) while very close, further increasing the imminence of a collision.
- Time safety score: 1 (Extreme Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 1 (Extreme Risk)
