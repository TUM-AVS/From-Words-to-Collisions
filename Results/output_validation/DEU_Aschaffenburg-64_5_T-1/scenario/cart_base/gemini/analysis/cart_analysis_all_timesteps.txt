Obstacle 30195 is in the same lane as the ego vehicle and is rapidly approaching from behind.  At the last timestep (2.3s), obstacle 30195 is only 7.26 meters behind the ego vehicle, but traveling significantly faster (11.18 m/s vs 6.92 m/s). Given the closing velocity and small distance, a collision is highly likely in the next few moments if obstacle 30195 does not brake significantly. While the decelerations vary over the preceding timesteps, the overall trend points to a high risk of collision.  Obstacle 30187, while in an adjacent lane, is not presenting an immediate collision risk.
