### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 30187.0
- Distance Risk reason: This obstacle is in a different lanelet (177.0) than the ego vehicle (176.0).  Over the past 10 timesteps, its Y-coordinate has consistently been significantly lower than the ego vehicle's, indicating no lateral collision risk. Its X-coordinate is decreasing, suggesting it is moving away from the ego vehicle longitudinally.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: The obstacle's velocity and acceleration patterns over the past 10 timesteps show no indication of a potential collision course with the ego vehicle.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 30195.0
- Distance Risk reason: This obstacle is in the same lanelet (176.0) as the ego vehicle. While its Y-coordinate has been slightly above the ego vehicle's, the difference has decreased over the last 10 timesteps.  Critically, its X-coordinate is consistently lower, and the distance between the vehicles is increasing.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: While this obstacle is moving faster than the ego vehicle, its velocity is decreasing, further mitigating the risk. The consistent negative acceleration over the time history supports this.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. **Most critical obstacle:** Obstacle 30195.0 poses the most significant risk due to being in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle.
2. **Trajectory analysis:** Over the 10 timesteps, Obstacle 30195.0 remained in the same lanelet and moved faster than the ego vehicle, but it is also decelerating, so is moving away from the ego vehicle. Obstacle 30187.0 remained in a different lanelet and poses no risk.
3. **Relative positions, velocities, and accelerations:** Obstacle 30195.0's relative position to the ego vehicle is behind and slightly to the left. While its velocity is higher than the ego vehicle's, the deceleration suggests it is not on a collision course. Obstacle 30187.0's trajectory and different lanelet clearly indicate no risk.
4. **Collision determination:**  No collision has occurred or is imminent.
5. **Reasoning:** The combination of lanelet positions, relative distances increasing, and the decelerating velocity of Obstacle 30195.0 indicates a low probability of collision. Obstacle 30187.0 is in a different lanelet and its movement poses no threat.
