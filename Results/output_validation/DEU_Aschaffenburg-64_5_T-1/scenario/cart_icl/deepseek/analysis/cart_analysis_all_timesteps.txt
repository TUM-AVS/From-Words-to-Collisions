### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. No obstacles are in immediate collision course with ego (no score 0)
2. Obstacles 30192.0 and 30193.0 in same lanelet require monitoring but have manageable risk
3. All other obstacles are either static, in different lanes, or moving away
4. Ego's stable velocity (6.9216) and controlled acceleration (0.0897) help maintain safety margins
