### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 30187.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is in a different lanelet and poses no immediate threat. The distance and orientations suggest no risk given the separate lanelets.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: The obstacle's trajectory and velocity show no indication of potential intersection with the ego vehicle's path.  The consistent movement in a separate lane reduces risk over time.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 30195.0
- Distance Risk reason: Although in the same lanelet, the obstacle is behind the ego vehicle. The distance between them seems to be increasing slightly based on the provided data.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason:  The obstacle is moving faster than the ego vehicle, but decelerating. There's a possibility of the gap closing significantly in the future, requiring monitoring.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. At the most recent timestep (2.3s), no obstacles are on a direct collision course with the ego vehicle.
2. Obstacle 30187.0 is in a different lane and poses no immediate risk.
3. Obstacle 30195.0 is in the same lane but behind the ego vehicle.  While the distance and time scores indicate low to medium risk, it isn't a collision at the current timestep.
