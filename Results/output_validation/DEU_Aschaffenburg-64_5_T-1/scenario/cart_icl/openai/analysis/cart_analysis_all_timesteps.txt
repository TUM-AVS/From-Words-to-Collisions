### Obstacle Analysis:

#### Obstacle ID: 30187
- **Distance Risk Reason**: Positioned in a different lanelet than the ego vehicle. It shows consistently minimal lateral positional changes relative to the other objects in its dynamic area.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 4 (Minimal risk as its movement is away from direct impact paths.)

- **Time Risk reason**: It maintains a steady velocity with minor acceleration fluctuations away from the ego vehicle, indicating reduced potential for collision over time.
- **Time Safety Score**: 4 (Low risk given the separation and consistent velocity.)

- **Overall Risk Score**: 4

#### Obstacle ID: 30195
- **Distance Risk Reason**: It's in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle. Shows consistent proximity to the ego vehicle across timesteps, and it is gradually approaching it.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 2 (High risk due to proximity and lane sharing.)

- **Time Risk reason**: Although decelerating, the relative velocity still points toward a closing gap, increasing collision likelihood if trends continue.
- **Time Safety Score**: 2 (High risk, as it's decelerating but the approach continues.)

- **Overall Risk Score**: 2

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
There is no clear indication of an imminent collision scenario, but high-risk conditions are present due to high proximity and similar lane occupancy of Obstacle 30195 with the ego vehicle. Unchanged trajectories and slight deceleration indicate a high risk, warranting precaution but not a collision at this specific timestep.
