Obstacle 30187 is in the Front-left of the ego car with a longitudinal distance of 3.17m and a lateral distance of 1.89m. The relative longitudinal velocity is -15.96 m/s, indicating it is moving towards the ego vehicle. While the lateral relative velocity is 0.18 m/s, suggesting it is slightly moving away laterally, the high closing longitudinal velocity and proximity pose a significant risk.

Obstacle 30195 is in direct collision with the ego car at this timestep (longitudinal and lateral distance 0.00m).  The relative longitudinal velocity is 4.26 m/s, indicating the obstacle is moving towards the ego vehicle from behind. This confirms a collision has occurred.

**Risk Levels and Definitions:**
<Collision (Score: 0)>: Actual collision has occurred or is unavoidable within the next timestep.
<Extreme Risk (Score: 1)>: Immediate collision or very high likelihood of impact. Urgent action is required.
<High Risk (Score: 2)>: Close to collision or highly probable collision path. Needs prompt attention and quick manoeuvring.
<Medium Risk (Score: 3)>: Moderate collision risk but manageable with timely reactions and proper strategies.
<Low Risk (Score: 4)>: Minimal collision risk. The situation is controllable with sufficient time to react.
<Negligible Risk (Score: 5)>: No significant collision risk. Obstacles are either moving away or far enough not to interfere.
