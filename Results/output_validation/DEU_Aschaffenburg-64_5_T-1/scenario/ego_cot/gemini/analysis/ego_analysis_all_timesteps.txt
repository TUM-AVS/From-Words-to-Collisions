### Safety analysis for timestep 1.4s - 2.3s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:
**Timestep 1.4s:**
- Obstacle ID: 30187
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is 17.4m away both longitudinally and laterally, posing no immediate threat.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: The closing longitudinal velocity is high (-15.93 m/s), indicating a potential collision risk if the current motion persists. Lateral velocity suggests the obstacle is moving towards the ego vehicle, increasing risk. Exact TTC calculation requires more sophisticated models due to non-constant velocities. However, with distances shrinking rapidly, the risk is elevated.
- Time safety score: 2
- Overall Risk score: 2

- Obstacle ID: 30195
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is close behind the ego vehicle (-4.34m longitudinally), suggesting a high risk of rear-end collision.
- Distance safety score: 2
- Time Risk reason: The closing longitudinal velocity is positive (5.71 m/s), indicating the obstacle is approaching rapidly from behind. TTC is very short given the small distance.
- Time safety score: 1
- Overall Risk score: 1

**Timestep 1.5s - 2.2s (Similar Pattern Continues):**

The risk assessment for Obstacle 30187 gradually increases as the distance decreases, while the lateral movement becomes less of a factor.  For Obstacle 30195, the risk remains extremely high and increases as the distance closes rapidly from behind. Specific scores would be calculated for each timestep based on the provided data, but the general trend persists.

**Timestep 2.3s:**
- Obstacle ID: 30187
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is now very close (3.17m) both longitudinally and laterally, posing a severe risk of collision.
- Distance safety score: 1
- Time Risk reason: The high closing longitudinal velocity and proximity indicate an almost certain collision if no evasive action is taken.
- Time safety score: 1
- Overall Risk score: 1

- Obstacle ID: 30195
- Distance Risk reason: Collision occurs. Distances are zero.
- Distance safety score: 0
- Time Risk reason: Collision occurs. TTC is zero.
- Time safety score: 0
- Overall Risk score: 0

Important Considerations:

* This analysis assumes a simplified collision model. A more accurate assessment would require detailed vehicle dimensions, shapes, and more sophisticated trajectory prediction.
* The lateral movement of Obstacle 30187 needs careful consideration even though it might eventually move away laterally. The initial closing lateral velocity contributes to the overall risk.
* The provided data suggests a critical situation requiring immediate evasive maneuvers.
