### Obstacle-by-Obstacle Analysis

#### Obstacle 30187 (Front-left of ego car)
- **Latest Timestep (2.3s)**:
  - Adjusted longitudinal distance: 3.17 m (closing at -15.96 m/s)
  - Adjusted lateral distance: 1.89 m (moving away at 0.18 m/s)
  - Motion: Driving toward ego longitudinally, moving away laterally to the left.
  
- **Trajectory Analysis**:
  - Longitudinal distance decreases rapidly (from 17.40m to 3.17m in 0.9s).
  - Lateral distance fluctuates but is now increasing (from 2.52m to 1.89m).
  
- **TTC Calculation**:
  - Longitudinal TTC = 3.17 / 15.96 ≈ 0.20 seconds (Extreme Risk, TTC ≤ 0.5s).
  - Lateral TTC: Not applicable (moving away).
  
- **MDC Calculation**:
  - Lateral distance is increasing, so MDC is the current lateral distance (1.89m).
  - Longitudinal MDC is effectively 0m if trajectories continue (collision imminent).
  
- **Risk Assessment**:
  - Longitudinal: Extreme Risk (TTC ≤ 0.5s).
  - Lateral: No Risk (increasing distance).
  - **Overall Risk Score: 1 (Extreme Risk)**.

#### Obstacle 30195 (Behind of ego car)
- **Latest Timestep (2.3s)**:
  - Adjusted longitudinal distance: 0.00 m (collision occurring).
  - Adjusted lateral distance: 0.00 m (collision occurring).
  - Motion: Exact longitudinal and lateral alignment.
  
- **Trajectory Analysis**:
  - Longitudinal distance closes from -4.34m to 0.00m (collision).
  - Lateral distance remains 0.00m (same lane).
  
- **TTC Calculation**:
  - TTC = 0 seconds (collision occurring).
  
- **MDC Calculation**:
  - MDC = 0 meters (collision occurring).
  
- **Risk Assessment**:
  - **Overall Risk Score: 0 (Collision)**.

### Final Determination
- **Obstacle 30195** is in a collision state (distance = 0.00m in both dimensions).
- **Obstacle 30187** is at extreme risk (TTC ≈ 0.20s) but has not yet collided.
- This is a **collision scenario** because at least one obstacle (30195) has a risk score of 0.
