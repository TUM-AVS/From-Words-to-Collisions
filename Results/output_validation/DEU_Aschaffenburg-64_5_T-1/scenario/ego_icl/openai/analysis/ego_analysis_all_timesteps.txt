To assess the collision risks, we will focus on the most recent timestep (2.3 seconds) and analyze both obstacles using the adjusted distances. We'll calculate the Time-to-Collision (TTC) and the Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC) for each obstacle.

### Analysis of Obstacle 30187 at 2.3 seconds:
- **Position**: Front-left of the ego vehicle.
- **Adjusted Longitudinal Distance**: 3.17 meters
- **Adjusted Lateral Distance**: 1.89 meters
- **Relative Velocities**: Longitudinal = -15.96 m/s, Lateral = 0.18 m/s 

#### Trajectory Analysis:
- **Longitudinal Distance**: Decreasing rapidly, indicating a closing path.
- **Lateral Distance**: The obstacle is moving slightly away but still very close.

#### Calculations:
- **Longitudinal TTC**: 3.17 / 15.96 â‰ˆ 0.20 seconds
- **Lateral TTC is not critical here** since motion is directed away.

#### Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC):
- The MDC is primarily determined by the rapidly closing longitudinal distance, while laterally it remains > 1.5 meters.

#### Risk Assessment:
- **Longitudinal MDC**: Critical due to decreasing distance.
- **Overall Risk**: Extreme Risk
  - With a TTC of 0.20 seconds longitudinally, this obstacle presents an Extreme Risk, given it could intersect if the trend continues.

### Analysis of Obstacle 30195 at 2.3 seconds:
- **Position**: Directly behind the ego vehicle, longitudinal alignment is exact.
- **Adjusted Longitudinal Distance**: 0.00 meters (indicating a collision as per given data)
- **Adjusted Lateral Distance**: 0.00 meters (lateral alignment)

#### Trajectory Analysis:
- The obstacle is directly at the same position as the ego vehicle, suggesting they have made contact, since stated longitudinal distance is 0.00 meters.

#### Calculations:
- **TTC**: Not applicable, as collision is detected.
- **MDC**: 0 meters as per given context.

#### Risk Assessment:
- **Collision Occurring**: This obstacle is already in a collision state.

### Conclusion:
Given that Obstacle 30195 is in direct contact with the ego vehicle (distances are 0.00 meters in both dimensions), this scenario qualifies as a collision scenario. Furthermore, Obstacle 30187 presents an Extreme Risk with a TTC well below 0.5 seconds in the longitudinal direction, emphasizing how critical intervention is required for both obstacles.
