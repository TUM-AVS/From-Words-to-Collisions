### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
    - Obstacle ID: 30187
    - Relative Direction: Front-left
    - Distance Risk Reason: DTClong is 3.17m, indicating a medium risk. DTClat is 1.89m, indicating a medium risk.  Over the past timesteps, DTClong has been decreasing, while DTClat initially increased and then began to decrease. The obstacle is approaching longitudinally, and while it moves away laterally initially, it begins to move back towards the ego vehicle.
    - Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 3
    - Lateral Distance Safety Score: 3
    - Overall Distance Safety Score: 3.0  (3 * 0.5 + 3 * 0.5 = 3.0)
    - Time Risk Reason: TTClong is 0.20s, indicating an extreme risk. TTClat is inf, indicating negligible risk. Across previous timesteps, TTClong has been consistently decreasing, indicating an increasing longitudinal collision risk.  TTClat initially decreases but then rapidly increases, indicating the car is changing the lane.
    - Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 1
    - Lateral Time Safety Score: 5
    - Overall Time Safety Score: 3.0 (1 * 0.5 + 5 * 0.5 = 3.0)
    - Overall Risk Score: 3 (0.5 * 3.0 + 0.5 * 3.0 = 3.0)

    - Obstacle ID: 30195
    - Relative Direction: Behind
    - Distance Risk Reason: DTClong is 0.00m, indicating a collision risk. DTClat is 0.00m, indicating a collision risk. Over the previous timesteps, DTClong has been consistently decreasing, indicating an increasing longitudinal collision risk from the rear.  The cars are moving into each other.
    - Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 0
    - Lateral Distance Safety Score: 0
    - Overall Distance Safety Score: 0.0 (0 * 1.0 + 0 * 0.0 = 0.0)
    - Time Risk Reason: TTClong is 0.00s, indicating a collision risk. TTClat is 0.00s, indicating a collision risk.  Over the previous timesteps, TTClong has been decreasing, heading to 0. This represents an imminent collision.
    - Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 0
    - Lateral Time Safety Score: 0
    - Overall Time Safety Score: 0.0 (0 * 1.0 + 0 * 0.0 = 0.0)
    - Overall Risk Score: 0 (0.5 * 0.0 + 0.5 * 0.0 = 0.0)
