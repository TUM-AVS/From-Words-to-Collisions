Here's the collision risk analysis for the provided scenario:

**Obstacle 33:** This obstacle is in the same lane as the ego vehicle and its longitudinal position is decreasing, indicating it is approaching the ego vehicle from behind.  While the closing velocity is significant, Obstacle 33 maintains a safe following distance over the observed time steps. Therefore the risk level with Obstacle 33 is assessed as **Medium (3)**.

**Obstacle 345:** This obstacle is in a different lane and poses **Negligible Risk (5)** to the ego vehicle.

**Obstacle 378:**  This obstacle is located in a different lanelet than the ego vehicle, and while the y-positions indicate some proximity, there's no indication of an immediate collision risk. The risk level with Obstacle 378 is assessed as **Low (4)**.

**Obstacle 380:** This obstacle is in a different lanelet and moving away from the ego vehicle. It poses **Negligible Risk (5)**.

**Obstacle 383:** This obstacle is also located in a different lanelet and poses **Low Risk (4)** to the ego vehicle.
