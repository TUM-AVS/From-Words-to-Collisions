Obstacle 33: This obstacle is in the same lane as the ego vehicle and its longitudinal position is getting closer to the ego vehicle, while its velocity is significantly higher and increasing. This represents a high risk of rear-end collision. Initially, the obstacle was somewhat behind the ego vehicle, but its higher velocity and acceleration suggest a collision is likely if no action is taken.  Risk score: 2.

Obstacle 345: This obstacle is in a different lane and is not moving towards the ego vehicle's lanelet based on its position updates. It was also initially further behind the ego vehicle.  It has shifted slightly closer over the timesteps but remains in its lanelet and is not an immediate threat. Risk score: 4.

Obstacle 378: This obstacle is in a different lanelet and is moving away from the ego vehicle's lanelet and therefore not presenting a risk. Risk score: 5.

Obstacle 380:  This obstacle is in a different lanelet and moving away from the ego vehicle. It does not pose a collision risk. Risk score: 5.

Obstacle 383: This obstacle is also in a different lanelet and not getting closer laterally or longitudinally. Risk score: 5.
