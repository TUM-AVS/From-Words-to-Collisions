To evaluate the scenario, I'll focus primarily on the most recent timestep, which is at 1.8 seconds, and compare the trajectories of obstacles relative to the ego vehicle.

**Analysis of Each Obstacle at 1.8 seconds:**

**Obstacle 33.0:**
- Position: (515.69676, 921.77481)
- Relative position to ego: ~4 meters ahead, ~5 meters to the side.
- Relative velocity: Approaching at a higher speed than ego, with increasing velocity.
- The close proximity and shared lanelet with the ego vehicle indicate a potential risk.
- An action is needed to avoid collision due to high relative speed and proximity.

**Obstacle 345.0:**
- Position: (509.99311, 908.30324)
- Relative position to ego: ~7 meters behind, ~18 meters to the side.
- Relative velocity: Moderate speed, further behind and on a different trajectory.
- This obstacle poses a negligible risk due to distance and different lanelet.

**Obstacle 378.0:**
- Position: (524.67621, 937.02673)
- Relative position to ego: ~7 meters ahead, ~11 meters to the side.
- Relative velocity: Different lanelet, moving away.
- No immediate threat given the distance, speed, and different lanes.

**Obstacle 380.0:**
- Position: (532.33679, 940.19031)
- Relative position to ego: ~15 meters ahead, ~14 meters to the side.
- Relative velocity: High speed but diverging path.
- This is low risk given the divergence in lanes and larger distance.

**Obstacle 383.0:**
- Position: (512.9387, 951.92956)
- Relative position to ego: ~4 meters behind, ~26 meters offset.
- Relative velocity: Low speed and decelerating.
- No immediate concern given lateral offset and differing paths.

**Risk Analysis:**

- Obstacle 33.0 presents a risk due to its speed increase and close proximity in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle. The risk level for this obstacle is High Risk (2) because a collision needs to be urgently prevented.
  
- No obstacle reached an Extreme Risk (1) or Collision (0) level.
