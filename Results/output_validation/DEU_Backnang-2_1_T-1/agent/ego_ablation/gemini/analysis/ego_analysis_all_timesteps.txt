At time 1.8s, Obstacle 33 poses an extreme risk of collision. It is located directly behind the ego vehicle at a longitudinal distance of -0.53 meters, indicating a very close proximity. Although the lateral distance is zero, the obstacle's motion suggests it is moving towards the ego vehicle, which is a dangerous situation. The small longitudinal distance combined with the closing velocity results in a very high risk of collision. Obstacles 345, 378, 380, and 383 do not pose an immediate collision risk.
