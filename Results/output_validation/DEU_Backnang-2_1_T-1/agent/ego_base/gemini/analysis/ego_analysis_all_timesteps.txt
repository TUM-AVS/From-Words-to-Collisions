Obstacle 33 is behind the ego vehicle at a longitudinal distance of -0.53m, indicating it is very close.  Its relative longitudinal velocity is 4.95 m/s, meaning it is approaching the ego vehicle rapidly. This represents an extremely dangerous situation and a likely imminent collision. Risk score: 1.

Obstacle 345 is behind the ego vehicle at -15.16m and approaching with a moderate relative longitudinal velocity of 2.27 m/s.  It does not pose an immediate threat. Risk score: 4.

Obstacle 378 is in the front-right of the ego vehicle at 7.98m longitudinal and -0.76m lateral distance.  It's moving away longitudinally at 1.76 m/s, posing no immediate longitudinal risk. The slight lateral movement also doesn't pose a significant risk at the current distance. Risk score: 5.

Obstacle 380 is in the front-right, 13.86m longitudinal and -6.61m lateral distance. It is moving towards the ego vehicle longitudinally but away laterally. Given the distances and relative velocities, this obstacle doesn't pose a significant risk. Risk score: 5.

Obstacle 383 is in the front-left, 17.21m longitudinal and 12.60m lateral distance. It is moving towards the ego vehicle both longitudinally and laterally, but the distances and speeds are moderate. This obstacle doesn't represent an immediate threat. Risk score: 4.

Risk Levels:
0: Collision - Physical contact occurred or unavoidable
1: Extreme Risk - Immediate collision likely
2: High Risk - Close to collision, needs quick action
3: Medium Risk - Manageable with proper reaction
4: Low Risk - Minimal risk, sufficient time to react
5: Negligible Risk - No significant risk
