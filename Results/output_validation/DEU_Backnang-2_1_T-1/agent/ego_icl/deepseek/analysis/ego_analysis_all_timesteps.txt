Let me analyze each obstacle at the most recent timestep (1.8 seconds) with trajectory context:

1. Obstacle 33 (Behind):
- Longitudinal: -0.53m (closing rapidly from behind)
- Lateral: 0.00m (perfect alignment)
- Relative velocity: 4.95 m/s (closing)
- TTC: 0.53/4.95 = 0.107s (Extreme Risk)
- MDC: 0.53m (High Risk)
- Trajectory: Consistently closing distance with increasing speed
- Risk: 0 (Collision imminent - will hit ego from behind within next timestep)

2. Obstacle 345 (Behind):
- Longitudinal: -15.16m
- Lateral: 0.00m
- Relative velocity: 2.27 m/s
- TTC: 15.16/2.27 = 6.68s (No Risk)
- MDC: 15.16m (No Risk)
- Risk: 5

3. Obstacle 378 (Front-right):
- Longitudinal: 7.98m (increasing)
- Lateral: -0.76m (increasing)
- Relative velocities: Both dimensions moving away
- Risk: 5 (No risk - diverging paths)

4. Obstacle 380 (Front-right):
- Longitudinal: 13.86m (closing slowly)
- Lateral: -6.61m (moving rapidly away)
- Primary risk dimension: lateral (moving away)
- Risk: 5 (No risk)

5. Obstacle 383 (Front-left):
- Longitudinal: 17.21m (closing slowly)
- Lateral: 12.60m (closing slowly)
- Both distances large and closing very slowly
- Risk: 4 (Low risk - MDC >5m in both dimensions)

Critical Findings:
- Obstacle 33 is about to collide with ego from behind (distance <1m, high closing speed)
- No other obstacles pose immediate risk
- Obstacle 33 shows consistent closing trajectory across all timesteps
