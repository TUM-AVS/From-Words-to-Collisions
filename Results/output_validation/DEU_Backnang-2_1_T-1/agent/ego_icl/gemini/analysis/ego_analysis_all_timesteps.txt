Obstacle 33: This obstacle is behind the ego vehicle and approaching rapidly.  The longitudinal distance has decreased from -4.05m to -0.53m over the observed time steps, indicating a high closing velocity. The lateral distance remains at 0.00m, meaning it's directly behind the ego vehicle. With a relative longitudinal velocity of 4.95 m/s and a distance of -0.53m, the TTC is approximately 0.11 seconds. The MDC is also very small at 0.53m. Both TTC and MDC indicate an *Extreme Risk*.

Obstacle 345: This obstacle is also behind the ego vehicle but much farther away. The longitudinal distance has decreased slightly from -16.61m to -15.16m.  With a relative longitudinal velocity of 2.27 m/s, TTC is approximately 6.68 seconds.  MDC is much larger than 5m. Despite the approaching motion, the large distance and relatively slow closing speed classify this as *Negligible Risk*.

Obstacle 378: This obstacle is in front of the ego vehicle and moving away. The longitudinal distance increases from 5.70m to 7.98m, and the small lateral shift does not pose a risk. With a positive relative longitudinal velocity (moving away), TTC is not relevant for collision assessment. The MDC is greater than 5m. Therefore, there is *Negligible Risk*.

Obstacle 380:  This obstacle is to the front-right and moving away laterally while slightly approaching longitudinally. The longitudinal distance has decreased from 15.56m to 13.86m, but the lateral distance has increased (negatively) from 0.00m to -6.61m indicating it is becoming less of a risk as time goes on. Due to lateral movement, there is *Negligible Risk*.

Obstacle 383: This obstacle is to the front-left of the ego vehicle. The longitudinal distance has decreased from 18.14m to 17.21m and the lateral distance from 14.17m to 12.60m. Both are decreasing slowly. Calculating based on the smaller lateral distance of 12.60m and a relative lateral velocity of -2.62m/s the TTC is approximately 4.81s which puts it within *Low Risk*. However, given both lateral and longitudinal distances decrease, I calculate MDC via hypotenuse at the final step which equals to 21.30m which is still within the safe zone. Thus it is safe to put this at *Low Risk*.
