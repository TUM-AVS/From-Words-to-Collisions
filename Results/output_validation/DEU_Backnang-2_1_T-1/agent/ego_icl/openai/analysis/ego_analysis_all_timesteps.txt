### Obstacle Analysis

#### Obstacle 33 (Behind)
- **Adjusted Distance**: longitudinal = -0.53 m, lateral = 0.00 m
- **Relative Velocity**: longitudinal = 4.95 m/s, lateral = -0.04 m/s
- **Trajectory**: Accelerating towards the ego vehicle (consistent closing over timesteps)
- **TTC Calculation**: 
  1. Longitudinal TTC = 0.53 / 4.95 = 0.107 seconds
  2. Same-lane alignment suggests a high likelihood of collision
- **MDC Assessment**: Longitudinal distance very small and decreasing rapidly
- **Risk Determination**: Extreme Risk based on very low TTC and closing trajectory

#### Obstacle 345 (Behind)
- **Adjusted Distance**: longitudinal = -15.16 m, lateral = 0.00 m
- **Relative Velocity**: longitudinal = 2.27 m/s, lateral = 0.01 m/s
- **Trajectory**: Approaching but at a far distance and slower relative speeds
- **TTC Calculation**: 
  1. Longitudinal TTC = 15.16 / 2.27 = 6.68 seconds
- **MDC Assessment**: Safe distance and closing time
- **Risk Determination**: No significant risk due to large TTC and safe distance

#### Obstacle 378 (Front-right)
- **Adjusted Distance**: longitudinal = 7.98 m, lateral = -0.76 m
- **Relative Velocity**: longitudinal = 1.76 m/s, lateral = -1.77 m/s
- **Trajectory**: Moving away both longitudinally and laterally
- **TTC Calculation**: N/A due to moving away
- **MDC Assessment**: No approach along both axes
- **Risk Determination**: No risk as both distances are increasing

#### Obstacle 380 (Front-right)
- **Adjusted Distance**: longitudinal = 13.86 m, lateral = -6.61 m
- **Relative Velocity**: longitudinal = -1.79 m/s, lateral = -6.70 m/s
- **Trajectory**: Moving away from the ego car
- **TTC Calculation**: N/A as no collision course
- **MDC Assessment**: No collision path currently
- **Risk Determination**: No risk as both distances are increasing

#### Obstacle 383 (Front-left)
- **Adjusted Distance**: longitudinal = 17.21 m, lateral = 12.60 m
- **Relative Velocity**: longitudinal = -1.23 m/s, lateral = -2.62 m/s
- **Trajectory**: Approaching the ego car laterally
- **TTC Calculation**: N/A due to diverging paths longitudinally
- **MDC Assessment**: Both longitudinal and lateral movements do not suggest immediate collision
- **Risk Determination**: No risk based on trajectory

### Summary
- **Obstacle 33** poses the most significant risk with an **Extreme Risk** level.
- The remaining obstacles present no immediate collision threat within the provided context.
