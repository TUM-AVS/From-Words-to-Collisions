At t=2.0s, Obstacle 33 is in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle and its position and rapidly increasing velocity suggest a very high risk of collision.  Obstacle 345 is also in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle and its position and velocity, though less severe than Obstacle 33, still pose a risk that needs attention. The remaining obstacles are in different lanelets and pose less immediate risk given their current trajectories.

Obstacle 345, also in the same lanelet and approaching quickly, poses a high risk but less immediate than Obstacle 33. No collision is imminent (within next timestep or two)."
