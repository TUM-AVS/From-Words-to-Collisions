### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 33.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 33 is in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle and its longitudinal position is getting closer to the ego vehicle over time.  
- Distance safety score: 2
- Time Risk reason: Obstacle 33's velocity is significantly higher than the ego vehicle and increasing, while the ego vehicle maintains constant velocity, suggesting increasing risk.
- Time safety score: 2
- Overall Risk score: 2

- Obstacle ID: 345.0
- Distance Risk reason: Though in a different lanelet initially, Obstacle 345’s trajectory suggests it might merge into the ego vehicle's lane, and its y-position is approaching the ego vehicle's over time.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: Its velocity is higher than the ego vehicle but remains relatively constant and it shows a slight decrease in acceleration. 
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3

- Obstacle ID: 378.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 378 is in a different lanelet and its x and y positions show its moving away from the ego vehicle.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Velocity is higher than the ego vehicle, but decelerating, further reducing risk.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- Obstacle ID: 380.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 380 is in a different lanelet and its x and y positions indicate its moving away from the ego vehicle.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason:  High velocity, but moving away from the ego vehicle and decelerating.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 383.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 383 is in a different lanelet and its x and y position shows it is far from the ego vehicle.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Relatively low velocity and not heading towards the ego vehicle.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5


### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
Obstacle 33 presents the highest risk. It’s in the same lanelet, approaching rapidly from behind. While not an immediate collision, its high and increasing velocity relative to the ego vehicle warrants attention. Obstacle 345 presents a moderate risk due to its potential lane merge and decreasing distance to the ego vehicle. Other obstacles pose no significant risk. This is not a collision scenario as no obstacle has a risk score of 0.
