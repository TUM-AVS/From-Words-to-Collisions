### Safety analysis for timestep 1.1s - 2.0s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

**Methodology:**

Given the data, precise TTC calculation is difficult due to the lack of clear lateral movement information ("Exact lateral alignment or unknown case").  We'll approximate TTC based on longitudinal movement, focusing heavily on distance and closing velocities for a qualitative assessment. We will assume lateral movement does *not* contribute to a collision initially and adjust based on specific obstacle behaviors.

**Scoring Rationale:** The scoring will primarily rely on observed distances and closing rates.  Since acceleration data is provided, rapid changes in velocity will influence the score, favoring safer scores if deceleration is evident and penalizing if acceleration towards the ego vehicle is observed.

### Obstacle Analysis:

**Timesteps 1.1s to 1.9s:**

- **Obstacle ID: 33**
    - Distance Risk reason:  Obstacle 33 is consistently approaching the ego vehicle from behind, with longitudinal distance decreasing rapidly. It is very close to the ego vehicle.
    - Distance safety score: Scores decrease from 3 to 1 over the timesteps as the distance shrinks.
    - Time Risk reason: High closing velocity indicates very short time to collision.
    - Time safety score: Scores decrease from 2 to 1 over the timesteps.
    - Overall Risk score: Decreases from 2 to 1 across the provided timestamps, culminating in a collision.

- **Obstacle ID: 345**
    - Distance Risk reason:  Approaching from behind, but at a greater distance than Obstacle 33.
    - Distance safety score: 4 across all timesteps.
    - Time Risk reason: Closing velocity is relatively low.
    - Time safety score: 4 across all timesteps.
    - Overall Risk score: 4, low risk.

- **Obstacle ID: 378**
    - Distance Risk reason: Moving away from the ego vehicle longitudinally.  Lateral movement is unclear but assumed not to be a collision risk.
    - Distance safety score: 5
    - Time Risk reason: Increasing distance.
    - Time safety score: 5
    - Overall Risk score: 5, no risk.

- **Obstacle ID: 380**
    - Distance Risk reason: Although the longitudinal distance decreases slightly, lateral movement is significantly away from the ego vehicle.
    - Distance safety score: 4 to 5.
    - Time Risk reason: Lateral movement mitigates longitudinal approach.
    - Time safety score: 5
    - Overall Risk score: 5 - no risk.

- **Obstacle ID: 383**
    - Distance Risk reason: Relatively far, but longitudinal and lateral distances decrease slightly initially, then lateral velocity towards ego increases.  The significant distance provides a buffer.
    - Distance safety score: 4
    - Time Risk reason: The closing velocities and distances suggest ample time to react.
    - Time safety score: 4
    - Overall Risk score: 4, low risk.

**Timestep 2.0s:**

- **Obstacle ID: 33**
    - Distance Risk reason: Collision occurs at this timestep (0 distance).
    - Distance safety score: 0
    - Time Risk reason:  TTC is effectively zero.
    - Time safety score: 0
    - Overall Risk score: 0

- **Obstacle IDs: 345, 378, 380, 383**: Maintain their previous risk assessments, as their movement relative to the ego vehicle does not change significantly enough to warrant a different score.
