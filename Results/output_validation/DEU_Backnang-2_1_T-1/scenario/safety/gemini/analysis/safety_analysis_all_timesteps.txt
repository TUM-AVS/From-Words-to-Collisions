### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
    - Obstacle ID: 33
    - Relative Direction: Behind
    - Distance Risk Reason:  DTClong is 0.0m indicating a collision. The obstacle has been approaching from behind over the past several timesteps, with DTClong steadily decreasing.
    - Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 0
    - Lateral Distance Safety Score: 5
    - Overall Distance Safety Score: 0.0 
    - Time Risk Reason: TTClong is 0.0s, confirming the collision. The TTClong has also been decreasing consistently over previous timesteps.
    - Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 0
    - Lateral Time Safety Score: 5
    - Overall Time Safety Score: 0.0
    - Overall Risk Score: 0

    - Obstacle ID: 345
    - Relative Direction: Behind
    - Distance Risk Reason: DTClong is -14.67m, indicating the obstacle is behind and relatively far. This distance has been decreasing over the past timesteps but the vehicle is still far behind us.
    - Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 5
    - Lateral Distance Safety Score: 5
    - Overall Distance Safety Score: 5.0
    - Time Risk Reason: TTClong is 5.66s, suggesting ample time to react. The TTC has been decreasing, but it remains above a safe threshold at this time.
    - Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 5
    - Lateral Time Safety Score: 5
    - Overall Time Safety Score: 5.0
    - Overall Risk Score: 5

    - Obstacle ID: 378
    - Relative Direction: Front-right
    - Distance Risk Reason: DTClong is 8.30m, indicating the obstacle is far ahead. Lateral distance is minimal so DTClat is very high. Obstacle has been moving further longitudinally away over past timesteps.
    - Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 5
    - Lateral Distance Safety Score: 5
    - Overall Distance Safety Score: 5.0
    - Time Risk Reason: TTClong is inf, meaning there is no longitudinal collision risk. This and TTClat have been infinite for many timesteps.
    - Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 5
    - Lateral Time Safety Score: 5
    - Overall Time Safety Score: 5.0
    - Overall Risk Score: 5

    - Obstacle ID: 380
    - Relative Direction: Front-right
    - Distance Risk Reason: DTClong is 13.51m, indicating no longitudinal collision risk, supported by DTClat that is also very high. DTClong has remained far from collision for past timesteps.
    - Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 5
    - Lateral Distance Safety Score: 5
    - Overall Distance Safety Score: 5.0
    - Time Risk Reason: TTClong is 7.75s, indicating no longitudinal collision risk. The lateral motion ensures there is no lateral risk indicated by an infinite TTClat value.
    - Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 5
    - Lateral Time Safety Score: 5
    - Overall Time Safety Score: 5.0
    - Overall Risk Score: 5

    - Obstacle ID: 383
    - Relative Direction: Front-left
    - Distance Risk Reason: DTClong is 16.94m and DTClat is 12.08m indicating no immediate risk in either direction. DTClong has been high through most timesteps, however DTClat has decreased suggesting approach.
    - Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 5
    - Lateral Distance Safety Score: 5
    - Overall Distance Safety Score: 5.0
    - Time Risk Reason: TTClong is 13.27s and TTClat is 4.15s, indicating no immediate risk, although TTClat value is decreasing.
    - Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 5
    - Lateral Time Safety Score: 4
    - Overall Time Safety Score: 4.5
    - Overall Risk Score: 5
