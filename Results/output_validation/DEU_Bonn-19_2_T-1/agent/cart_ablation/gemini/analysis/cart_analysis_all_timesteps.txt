Here's the collision risk analysis:

**Obstacle 30202:** This obstacle starts relatively far from the ego vehicle, but its velocity and acceleration are both high and increasing over the time steps.  Its trajectory shows it moving closer to the ego vehicle, and at the last provided timestep, it's approaching the same lanelet (491) as the ego vehicle.  This, combined with the obstacle's increasing speed, makes a near-term collision highly likely. Thus, it represents an **Extreme Risk (1)**.

**Obstacle 30203:** This obstacle is moving away from the ego vehicle and poses **no immediate risk (5)**.

**Obstacle 30204:** This obstacle appears only in the last two time steps and is relatively far from the ego vehicle. While its trajectory isn't fully clear, the current data suggest **low risk (4)**. Further observation is needed to determine whether it might eventually pose more risk.

**Obstacle 30206:** This obstacle remains far from the ego vehicle throughout the scenario and presents **negligible risk (5)**.

**Obstacle 30209:** This obstacle appears only in the last two time steps and is far from the ego vehicle, posing **negligible risk (5)**.
