Obstacle 30202 is showing concerning behavior.  It's accelerating towards the ego vehicle and its lanelet changes suggest a possible lane change maneuver into the ego vehicle's lane. While not an immediate collision, the rapid acceleration and lane change possibility require close monitoring.  Obstacle 30203 is moving away from the ego vehicle, and although accelerating, does not pose an immediate threat. Obstacles 30204, 30206, and 30209 are also far from the ego vehicle and are not a concern currently.
