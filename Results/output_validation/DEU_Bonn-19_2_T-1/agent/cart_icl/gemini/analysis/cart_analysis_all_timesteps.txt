Obstacle 30202 is in the same lane as the ego vehicle and rapidly approaching from behind. Its accelerating motion suggests a potential imminent collision.  Obstacle 30203 is moving towards the ego vehicle's lanelet and accelerating, with a possible lane change maneuver indicated by changes in lateral position across time steps. This poses a high risk. Obstacle 30204, while laterally distant, has a decreasing longitudinal distance to the ego vehicle and warrants a medium risk assessment due to its uncertain trajectory.
