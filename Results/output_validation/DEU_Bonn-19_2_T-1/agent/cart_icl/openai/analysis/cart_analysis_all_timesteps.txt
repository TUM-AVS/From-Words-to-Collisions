**Scenario Analysis:**

I will evaluate each obstacle relative to the ego vehicle at the most recent timestep, 11.9 seconds, considering their trajectories from the prior timesteps and calculating the risk levels based on potential collision threats.

1. **Obstacle 30202.0**:
   - Position: (23.1799, 105.0724)
   - Lanelet: 491.0 (same lanelet as ego)
   - Velocity: 7.7044 m/s, heading towards the ego vehicle
   - Relative position: Approximately 5.1148m behind the ego in the same lanelet
   - Relative velocity: Closing in fast at 4.9486 m/s (7.7044 - 2.7558)
   - **TTC** is roughly 5.1148 / 4.9486 = 1.033 seconds
   - **Risk**: Due to imminent collision in the same lane within about 1 second, this is an **Extreme Risk (1)**

2. **Obstacle 30203.0**:
   - Position: (11.2143, 108.8308)
   - Lanelet: 1366.0 (different from ego)
   - No immediate threat to the ego, lateral separation maintained
   - **Risk**: **Low Risk (4)**

3. **Obstacle 30204.0**:
   - Position: (-0.3503, 109.5726)
   - Lanelet: 133.0 (different from ego)
   - Safe lateral and longitudinal distance, not closing in
   - **Risk**: **Negligible Risk (5)**

4. **Obstacle 30206.0**:
   - Position: (11.9499, 88.3323)
   - Lanelet: 451.0 (different from ego)
   - Safe lateral and longitudinal distance
   - **Risk**: **Negligible Risk (5)**

5. **Obstacle 30209.0**:
   - Position: (10.8876, 79.2609)
   - Lanelet: 451.0 (different from ego)
   - Located far from ego's location
   - **Risk**: **Negligible Risk (5)**

**Risk Summary**:  
Obstacle 30202.0 presents an **Extreme Risk** due to quickly closing position in the same lanelet with a short TTC.
