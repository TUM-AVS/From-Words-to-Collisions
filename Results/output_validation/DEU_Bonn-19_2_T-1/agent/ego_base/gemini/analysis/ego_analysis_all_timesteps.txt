At timestamp 11.9s:

* **Obstacle 30202 (Behind):**  Longitudinal distance is -0.81m and closing at 4.93 m/s.  This is extremely close and a collision is imminent. Risk score: 1.

* **Obstacle 30203 (Behind):** Longitudinal distance is -13.32m and closing at 2.81 m/s. Lateral velocity is high at 3.43 m/s,  indicating a possible lane change towards the ego vehicle. It represents a potential risk but not imminent collision.  Risk score: 2.

* **Obstacle 30204 (Rear-right):** Longitudinal distance is -24.36m and closing at 2.04 m/s.  Lateral distance is -3.21m and closing at 1.24 m/s. While approaching, it's not an immediate threat. Risk score: 3.

* **Obstacle 30206 (Rear-right):** Longitudinal distance is -5.18m and *moving away* at 3.54 m/s. Lateral distance is -18.51m but closing at 3.00 m/s.  The lateral movement is somewhat concerning, but the longitudinal distance increasing reduces the immediate risk. Risk score: 3.

* **Obstacle 30209 (Rear-right):** Longitudinal distance is -2.86m and *moving away* at 3.25 m/s. The lateral distance is -27.35m and closing at 1.89 m/s. The lateral movement needs monitoring, but the longitudinal separation increasing lowers the current risk. Risk score: 3.

Risk Levels:
0: Collision - Physical contact occurred or unavoidable
1: Extreme Risk - Immediate collision likely
2: High Risk - Close to collision, needs quick action
3: Medium Risk - Manageable with proper reaction
4: Low Risk - Minimal risk, sufficient time to react
5: Negligible Risk - No significant risk
