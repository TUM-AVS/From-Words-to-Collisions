### Safety analysis for timestep 11.9s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

**Assumptions and Calculations:**

* To determine TTC and MDC, we need the adjusted longitudinal and lateral distances. Since they are not provided, we will approximate them using the real distances.  However, in a real-world scenario, using the actual adjusted distances is crucial for accurate assessment.
* We'll calculate TTC by dividing the distance by the relative velocity. If the relative velocity is away from the ego vehicle, we consider the TTC as infinite, representing no risk.
* MDC is the minimum distance observed over the provided time steps.  We can only approximate using this data.



### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 30202**
- Distance Risk reason:  Obstacle is very close behind the ego vehicle (-0.81m longitudinal, -0.81m lateral). It appears to be on a collision course.
- Distance safety score: 0 (Collision)
- Time Risk reason: The relative velocity indicates a fast approach (4.93 m/s longitudinal).  This confirms the impending collision.
- Time safety score: 0 (Collision)
- Overall Risk score: 0 (Collision)


- **Obstacle ID: 30203**
- Distance Risk reason:  Although somewhat further behind (-13.32m longitudinal), the lateral distance is concerning (-13.32m), and the relative velocity suggests lateral movement toward the ego vehicle.
- Distance safety score: 4 (Low risk)
- Time Risk reason: The longitudinal TTC might be relatively high, but the lateral movement needs further observation. 
- Time safety score: 4 (Low risk)
- Overall Risk score: 4 (Low Risk)


- **Obstacle ID: 30204**
- Distance Risk reason: Relatively far from the ego vehicle.
- Distance safety score: 5 (Negligible risk)
- Time Risk reason: The longitudinal TTC is high due to the large distance.
- Time safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 5 (Negligible Risk)


- **Obstacle ID: 30206**
- Distance Risk reason: Moving away longitudinally (-5.18m), but lateral movement (-5.18m) is a potential concern.
- Distance safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
- Time Risk reason:  Moving away longitudinally means no longitudinal collision risk.  Lateral movement needs further observation.
- Time safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 4 (Low Risk)


- **Obstacle ID: 30209**
- Distance Risk reason: Moving away longitudinally but lateral movement (-2.86 m) and velocity are concerning.
- Distance safety score: 3 (Medium Risk)
- Time Risk reason: Longitudinally safe as it's moving away, however lateral movement needs more attention.
- Time safety score: 3 (Medium Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 3 (Medium Risk)
