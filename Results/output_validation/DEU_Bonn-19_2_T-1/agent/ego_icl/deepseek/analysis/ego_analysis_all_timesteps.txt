Let me analyze the most recent timestep (11.9 seconds) and assess collision risks for each obstacle:

1. Obstacle 30202 (Behind ego):
- Longitudinal distance: -0.81m (approaching rapidly)
- Lateral distance: 0.00m (perfect alignment)
- Relative velocity: 4.93 m/s (longitudinal), 0.46 m/s (lateral)
- TTC (longitudinal): 0.81/4.93 ≈ 0.16 seconds (Extreme Risk)
- MDC: 0.81m longitudinally (High Risk)
- Risk assessment: This obstacle is rapidly closing from behind with perfect lateral alignment. The extremely low TTC indicates imminent collision risk.

2. Obstacle 30203 (Behind ego):
- Longitudinal distance: -13.32m
- Lateral distance: 0.00m
- Relative velocity: 2.81 m/s (longitudinal), 3.43 m/s (lateral)
- TTC (longitudinal): 13.32/2.81 ≈ 4.74 seconds (Low Risk)
- MDC: 13.32m (No Risk)
- Risk assessment: While aligned laterally, the longitudinal distance is large and closing slowly.

3. Obstacle 30204 (Rear-right):
- Longitudinal distance: -24.36m
- Lateral distance: -3.21m
- Relative velocity: 2.04 m/s (longitudinal), 1.24 m/s (lateral)
- TTC (both dimensions >5s)
- MDC: >5m in both dimensions
- Risk assessment: No significant risk due to large distances.

4. Obstacle 30206 (Rear-right):
- Longitudinal distance: -5.18m (moving away)
- Lateral distance: -18.51m
- Relative velocity: -3.54 m/s (longitudinal), 3.00 m/s (lateral)
- TTC: Not applicable (moving away longitudinally)
- MDC: >5m
- Risk assessment: No risk as it's moving away.

5. Obstacle 30209 (Rear-right):
- Longitudinal distance: -2.86m (moving away)
- Lateral distance: -27.35m
- Relative velocity: -3.25 m/s (longitudinal), 1.89 m/s (lateral)
- TTC: Not applicable
- MDC: >5m
- Risk assessment: No risk.

Trajectory Analysis:
- Obstacle 30202 shows consistent rapid approach from behind with perfect lateral alignment. At current rate, it will collide with ego in ≈0.16s.
- Other obstacles either have large distances or are moving away.
