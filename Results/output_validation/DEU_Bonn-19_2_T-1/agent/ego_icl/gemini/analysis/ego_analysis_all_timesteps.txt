* Obstacle 30202: This obstacle is directly behind the ego vehicle (lateral distance 0.00m) and rapidly approaching. The longitudinal distance has decreased from -4.63m to -0.81m in just 0.9 seconds. The relative longitudinal velocity is 4.93 m/s, indicating a very high closing speed.  TTC = 0.81m / 4.93m/s ≈ 0.16 seconds. MDC is essentially the longitudinal distance of 0.81m. Both TTC and MDC indicate an *Extreme Risk (1)* of collision.

* Obstacle 30203: While initially behind and to the right, this obstacle's lateral movement is significant. At the last timestep, the lateral distance is 0.00m indicating it is now directly behind the ego vehicle, similar to obstacle 30202. However, with a longitudinal distance of -13.32m and relative velocity of 2.81 m/s, it poses a lower risk than 30202. TTC ≈ 4.74 seconds, MDC = 13.32m. This suggests a *Low Risk (4)* currently.  However, its lateral velocity (3.43 m/s) is concerning and needs further monitoring in the immediate future as it might become a higher risk soon.

* Obstacle 30204: This obstacle is behind and to the right of the ego vehicle, with a longitudinal distance of -24.36m and a lateral distance of -3.21m. The relative longitudinal and lateral velocities are 2.04 m/s and 1.24 m/s, respectively. TTC based on longitudinal is 24.36 / 2.04 ≈ 11.94 seconds.  TTC based on lateral is 3.21 / 1.24 ≈ 2.59 seconds. MDC ≈  24.41 based on trajectory and distance.  Given the larger distances and TTC values, this obstacle represents a *Low Risk (4)*.

* Obstacle 30206: This obstacle is moving away longitudinally (-3.54 m/s) but approaching laterally (3.00 m/s).  The longitudinal distance is increasing, from -2.64m initially to -5.18m, meaning there is not any risk for collision if we only consider the longitudinal trajectory. The lateral distance is also large (-18.51m). Considering the diagonal motion, and that the lateral distance is greater than 5 meters, this poses a *Negligible Risk (5)*. 

* Obstacle 30209: Similar to 30206, this obstacle is moving away longitudinally (-3.25 m/s) and approaching laterally (1.89 m/s). The longitudinal distance is increasing. The lateral distance is quite large (-27.35 m) and also increasing. The lateral motion does not pose a risk based on the available information. This obstacle presents a *Negligible Risk (5)*.
