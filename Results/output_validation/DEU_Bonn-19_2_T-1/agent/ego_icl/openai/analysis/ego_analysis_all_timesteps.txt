To assess the risk level and identify any potential collisions, I will analyze each obstacle at the most recent timestamp (11.9 seconds), taking into account their trajectories determined from previous timesteps. 

### Obstacle Analysis:

#### **Obstacle 30202**

- **Position & Trajectory:**
  - Relative Direction: Behind
  - Adjusted Longitudinal Distance: -0.81m
  - Adjusted Lateral Distance: 0.00m
  - Relative Velocity: Longitudinal 4.93 m/s (approaching)
  - Motion: Driving toward the ego car from behind, exact lateral alignment.

- **TTC Calculation:**
  - TTC (Longitudinal) = 0.81m / 4.93 m/s = 0.164 seconds
  - Lateral alignment implies a potential for same-lane collision.

- **MDC Calculation:**
  - MDC is essentially the longitudinal distance since lateral is 0.00m. MDC = -0.81m.

- **Risk Assessment:**
  - Since the longitudinal distance is negative and decreasing with a high approaching speed, and due to exact lateral alignment, it suggests that a collision is unavoidable even as TTC is slightly above 0.
  - **Risk Score:** 0 Collision

#### **Obstacle 30203**

- **Position & Trajectory:**
  - Relative Direction: Behind
  - Adjusted Longitudinal Distance: -13.32m
  - Adjusted Lateral Distance: 0.00m
  - Relative Velocity: Longitudinal 2.81 m/s (approaching)

- **TTC Calculation:**
  - TTC (Longitudinal) = 13.32m / 2.81 m/s = 4.74 seconds

- **MDC Calculation:**
  - Same logic as above, lateral alignment places emphasis on longitudinal calculation.
  - MDC = 13.32m which is not immediately alarming.

- **Risk Assessment:**
  - It shows close alignment but significant longitudinal distance and moderate closing velocity suggests low risk currently, but this could escalate if conditions persist.
  - **Risk Score:** 3 Medium Risk

#### **Obstacle 30204**

- **Position & Trajectory:**
  - Relative Direction: Rear-right
  - Adjusted Longitudinal Distance: -24.36m
  - Adjusted Lateral Distance: -3.21m
  - Relative Velocity: Longitudinal 2.04 m/s (approaching)

- **TTC Calculation:**
  - Predominantly lateral TTC calculation finds no immediate concern as lateral velocity is not high.
  - TTC is not calculated as it doesn't pose immediate threat.

- **MDC Calculation:**
  - Adequate separation in both dimensions.
  - MDC > 5.0m ensures no immediate risk.

- **Risk Assessment:**
  - With a large distance and constraints, there is no significant risk.
  - **Risk Score:** 5 Negligible Risk

#### **Obstacle 30206**

- **Position & Trajectory:**
  - Relative Direction: Rear-right
  - Adjusted Longitudinal Distance: -5.18m
  - Adjusted Lateral Distance: -18.51m
  - Relative Velocity: Longitudinal -3.54 m/s (moving away)

- **TTC Calculation:**
  - As the obstacle is moving away on both axes, no TTC calculation indicates any risk.

- **MDC Calculation:**
  - Obstacles moving away ensure no collision path. MDC is irrelevant.

- **Risk Assessment:**
  - Moving away significantly in both directions.
  - **Risk Score:** 5 Negligible Risk

#### **Obstacle 30209**

- **Position & Trajectory:**
  - Relative Direction: Rear-right
  - Adjusted Longitudinal Distance: -2.86m
  - Adjusted Lateral Distance: -27.35m
  - Relative Velocity: Longitudinal -3.25 m/s (moving away)

- **TTC Calculation:**
  - Irrelevant as the obstacle is moving away.

- **MDC Calculation:**
  - With significant distances maintained, MDC remains above 5.0m.

- **Risk Assessment:**
  - No risk as the pathway diverges.
  - **Risk Score:** 5 Negligible Risk

### Risk Analysis Summary (JSON Format):

```json
{
    "CollisionObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "30202",
        "OverallRiskScore": "0"
    },
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": null,
        "OverallRiskScore": null
    },
    "HighRiskObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": null,
        "OverallRiskScore": null
    }  
}
```

This assessment indicates the ego car faces a collision risk from Obstacle 30202 due to negative proximity and high closing velocity, with no other imminent high-risk cases currently.
