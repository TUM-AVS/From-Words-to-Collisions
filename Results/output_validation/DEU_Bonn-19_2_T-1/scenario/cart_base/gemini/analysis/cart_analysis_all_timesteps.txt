Obstacle 30202 is in the same lanelet (491) as the ego vehicle at the most recent timestep (12.1 seconds). Its position (24.6814, 104.5785) is rapidly approaching the ego vehicle's position (28.8068, 103.3435).  Given the velocity of 30202 (8.0112) and the ego vehicle (2.7558), a collision is highly likely in the next few timesteps if the trajectories remain unchanged. Obstacle 30202 therefore represents an extreme risk.
