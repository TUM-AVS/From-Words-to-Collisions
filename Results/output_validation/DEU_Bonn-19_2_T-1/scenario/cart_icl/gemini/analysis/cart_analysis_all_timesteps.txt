### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 30202.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 30202.0 is in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle and rapidly approaching from behind.  The distance is decreasing over time.
- Distance safety score: 2
- Time Risk reason: Given the relative velocities and closing distance, a collision is likely soon.
- Time safety score: 2
- Overall Risk score: 2

- Obstacle ID: 30203.0
- Distance Risk reason:  This obstacle is in a different lanelet and poses no immediate threat based on current trajectories.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason:  Lateral separation and differing trajectories mitigate risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 30204.0
- Distance Risk reason: In a different lanelet and sufficiently far away.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: No immediate time-related risk due to distance and lane separation.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 30206.0
- Distance Risk reason: Located in a different lanelet and far from the ego vehicle.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason:  Poses no immediate threat due to distance and lane separation.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 30209.0
- Distance Risk reason:  Different lanelet and far from ego vehicle.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: No time-based risk observed.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5


### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. At t=12.1s, obstacle 30202.0 is in the same lanelet (491.0) as the ego vehicle.
2.  Obstacle 30202.0 has been consistently approaching the ego vehicle over the observed time steps.
3. The relative velocity suggests a high probability of a near-term collision if the trajectories remain unchanged.
4. No other obstacles are in the same lane or present an immediate collision risk at t=12.1s.
5. This is not a *collision* scenario yet, but it is highly likely to become one very soon. It represents an *extreme risk* scenario.
