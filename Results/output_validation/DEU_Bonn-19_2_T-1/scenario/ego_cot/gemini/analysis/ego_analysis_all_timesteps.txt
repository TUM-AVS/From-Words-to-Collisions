### Safety analysis for timestep 11.2s - 12.1s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

**Methodology:**

Given the data, precise TTC calculations are challenging due to the non-constant relative velocities (accelerations are present).  A simplified approach assumes constant velocity over the next few seconds for a rough TTC estimate. For MDC, we analyze the trend of the distance values.

**Obstacle Analysis:**

* **Obstacle ID: 30202**
    * Distance Risk reason: This obstacle poses a rapidly increasing risk. It is directly behind the ego vehicle and closing at high speed.  Starting at roughly 4m behind, the distance shrinks to a collision by 12.1s.
    * Distance safety score: Scores degrade from 2 (11.2s) to 0 (12.1s)
    * Time Risk reason: Constant velocity approximation suggests an extremely short time to collision, aligning with the distance analysis.
    * Time safety score: 1 (throughout the scenario)
    * Overall Risk score: Degrades from 1 to 0. Collision occurs at 12.1s.

* **Obstacle ID: 30203**
    * Distance Risk reason: Located diagonally rear-right, and gradually approaching. Initially far (15m), but consistently moving closer, both longitudinally and laterally, over the timesteps.
    * Distance safety score: 3-4 (moderate risk initially, lowering as the scenario progresses).
    * Time Risk reason:  While approaching, it doesn't present an immediate collision threat within the timeframe.
    * Time safety score: 3
    * Overall Risk score: 3 (Lateral motion needs monitoring)

* **Obstacle ID: 30206**
    * Distance Risk reason:  While moving away longitudinally, it moves closer laterally, increasing risk.
    * Distance safety score: 3-2
    * Time Risk reason: No immediate longitudinal collision risk. Lateral motion needs attention.
    * Time safety score: 3-2
    * Overall Risk score: 3-2

* **Obstacle ID: 30204**
    * Distance Risk reason: Appears at 11.6s diagonally rear-right, relatively far (25m).  The distance closes consistently.
    * Distance safety score: 4 initially, slowly degrading to 3.
    * Time Risk reason: No immediate risk.
    * Time safety score: 4 initially, slowly degrading to 3.
    * Overall Risk score: 4 initially, degrading to 3.

* **Obstacle ID: 30209**
    * Distance Risk reason: Appears at 11.8s rear-right and close (2.6 m). Moves further longitudinally away but laterally closer.
    * Distance safety score: 2-3
    * Time Risk reason: Similar to 30206 - no immediate longitudinal collision risk, but lateral movement requires monitoring.
    * Time safety score: 2-3
    * Overall Risk score: 2-3

```json
{
    "CollisionObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "30202",
        "OverallRiskScore": "0"
    },
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null,
    "IsCollisionScenario": true,
    "Justification": "Obstacle 30202 collides with the ego vehicle at 12.1 seconds. It starts close behind and approaches rapidly, resulting in a rear-end collision.  While other obstacles approach, none present an immediate extreme risk (score of 1) within the scenario timeframe."
