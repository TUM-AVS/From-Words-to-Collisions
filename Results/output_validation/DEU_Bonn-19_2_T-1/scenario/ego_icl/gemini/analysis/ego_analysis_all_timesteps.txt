* **Obstacle 30202 (Behind):** This obstacle is the most concerning.  Over the past several timesteps, it has been rapidly approaching the ego vehicle from directly behind, maintaining perfect lateral alignment (0.00m lateral distance).  At the latest timestep (12.1s), the longitudinal distance is reported as 0.00m, indicating a collision. The relative longitudinal velocity is positive (5.24 m/s) meaning it closing on the ego and the relative lateral velocity is 0.48 m/s showing it is shifting toward the left.  This confirms a collision.

* **Obstacle 30203 (Behind):** This obstacle is also approaching from behind but is further away (-12.84m longitudinally at 12.1s) and not perfectly aligned laterally now. Its lateral shift across timesteps suggests a potential lane change to overtake the ego vehicle from the left. The relative longitudinal velocity is positive and small (2.58 m/s) and the relative lateral velocity is positive showing that obstacle is overtaking the ego. Considering the distance and velocities, the risk from this obstacle is lower than 30202.

* **Obstacle 30204 (Rear-right):**  This obstacle is relatively far behind and to the right of the ego vehicle (-23.89m longitudinal, -3.13m lateral at 12.1s).  It appears to be approaching diagonally but very slowly, posing no immediate threat.

* **Obstacle 30206 (Rear-right):**  This obstacle is moving *away* from the ego longitudinally (-5.77m and increasing) and laterally (-17.94m). Although the lateral movement is closer to the ego, the lateral direction is still far away and the risk is low.

* **Obstacle 30209 (Rear-right):** This obstacle also maintain a safe distance to the ego. The longitudinal distance is -3.34m meaning it has been diverging longitudinally and the relative lateral movement is also diverging, posing no immediate risk.

**Collision Scenario Determination:** Yes, this is a collision scenario. Obstacle 30202 has collided with the ego vehicle.
