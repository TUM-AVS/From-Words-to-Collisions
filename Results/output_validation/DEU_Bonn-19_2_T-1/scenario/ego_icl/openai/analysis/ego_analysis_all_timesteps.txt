Based on the data provided in the scenario context, let's analyze each obstacle at the most recent timestamp (12.1 seconds) and the trajectory data from earlier timestamps to determine risk levels.

### Obstacle-by-Obstacle Analysis:

#### Obstacle 30202:
- **Current Position:** Directly behind, real distance longitudinal 0.00m, lateral 0.00m.
- **Motion Description:** Exact longitudinal and lateral alignment with the ego car.
- **Relative Velocity:** Longitudinal 5.24 m/s. Lateral 0.48 m/s.
- **Trajectory Analysis:** Over the last few seconds, longitudinal distance has decreased from -3.11m to 0.00m with constant closing velocity, indicating a collision as it aligns perfectly with the ego vehicle.
- **TTC and MDC Calculations:** With a longitudinal distance of 0.00m and closing velocity, technically TTC is 0 seconds, confirming a collision in the present timeframe.
- **Risk Score:** Collision (Score 0)

#### Obstacle 30203:
- **Current Position:** Behind, real distance longitudinal -12.84m, lateral 0.00m.
- **Motion Description:** Driving toward the ego car.
- **Relative Velocity:** Longitudinal 2.58 m/s, Lateral 4.38 m/s.
- **Trajectory Analysis:** Only moderate closing velocity but not immediately critical longitudinally. Lateral movement suggests no immediate threat.
- **TTC Calculation:** \( TTC \approx \frac{12.84}{2.58} \approx 4.97 \) seconds longitudinally, indicating a low risk.
- **MDC Calculation:** Due to greater distances and lower approach speeds, MDC is approximately in the range of several meters over 3 seconds.
- **Risk Score:** Low Risk (Score 4)

#### Obstacle 30204:
- **Current Position:** Rear-right, long. -23.89m, lat. -3.13m.
- **Motion Description:** Approaching diagonally from the rear-right.
- **Relative Velocity:** Longitudinal 2.32 m/s, Lateral 1.35 m/s.
- **Trajectory Analysis:** Far enough with a trajectory that remains non-threatening in the immediate future.
- **TTC and MDC Calculations:** Both distances are large, and approach is not rapid, leading to a No Risk categorization.
- **Risk Score:** No Risk (Score 5)

#### Obstacle 30206:
- **Current Position:** Rear-right, long. -5.77m, lat. -17.94m.
- **Motion Description:** Moving away longitudinally, but closing laterally.
- **Relative Velocity:** Longitudinal -3.64 m/s, Lateral 3.29 m/s.
- **Trajectory Analysis:** Veering away longitudinally indicates separation in driving paths.
- **Risk Score:** No Risk (Score 5)

#### Obstacle 30209:
- **Current Position:** Rear-right, long. -3.34m, lat. -26.98m.
- **Motion Description:** Moving away longitudinally but closing laterally.
- **Relative Velocity:** Longitudinal -3.34 m/s, Lateral 2.17 m/s.
- **Trajectory Analysis:** Like obstacle 30206, it is noticeably diverging in the longitudinal direction.
- **Risk Score:** No Risk (Score 5)

### Conclusion
Obstacle 30202 presents a current collision scenario with a risk score of 0, indicating an immediate physical contact scenario. Other obstacles maintain adequate distances or diverging paths, leading to lower risks.
