### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 30202
- Relative Direction: Behind
- Distance Risk Reason: The obstacle is very close behind the ego vehicle (0.0m longitudinally), indicating a collision. Lateral distance is not relevant in this "Behind" scenario. History shows the obstacle has been approaching throughout the past timesteps.
- Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 0
- Lateral Distance Safety Score: 5
- Overall Distance Safety Score: 0.0 
- Time Risk Reason: TTClong is 0.0, confirming the collision. History shows a consistently decreasing TTC.
- Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 0
- Lateral Time Safety Score: 5
- Overall Time Safety Score: 0.0
- Overall Risk Score: 0

- Obstacle ID: 30203
- Relative Direction: Behind
- Distance Risk Reason: Located -12.84m behind, representing a safe longitudinal distance.  Lateral distance is irrelevant as wdominant = 1 in this case. History shows it's approaching but still at a safe distance.
- Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 5
- Lateral Distance Safety Score: 5
- Overall Distance Safety Score: 5.0
- Time Risk Reason: TTClong is 4.98s, a safe value. History shows a decreasing trend but currently safe.
- Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 4
- Lateral Time Safety Score: 5
- Overall Time Safety Score: 4.0
- Overall Risk Score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 30204
- Relative Direction: Rear-right
- Distance Risk Reason:  Longitudinal distance is -23.89m (safe) and Lateral distance is -3.13m. Considering the rear-right direction (wdominant = 0.5), both distances contribute to the score.
- Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 5
- Lateral Distance Safety Score: 4
- Overall Distance Safety Score: 4.5
- Time Risk Reason: TTClong is 10.30s and TTClat is 2.31s. Both are currently safe, but history suggests lateral TTC is decreasing, requiring monitoring.
- Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 5
- Lateral Time Safety Score: 3
- Overall Time Safety Score: 4.0
- Overall Risk Score: 4

- Obstacle ID: 30206
- Relative Direction: Rear-right
- Distance Risk Reason: Longitudinal distance is -5.77m and lateral is -17.94m. Both contribute as wdominant = 0.5.  Lateral distance is safe, longitudinal distance shows it's moving further away which is getting safer in recent timesteps.
- Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 4
- Lateral Distance Safety Score: 5
- Overall Distance Safety Score: 4.5
- Time Risk Reason: TTClong is inf (moving away) and TTClat is 5.45s. Both are safe. History shows a fairly constant lateral TTC.
- Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 5
- Lateral Time Safety Score: 4
- Overall Time Safety Score: 4.5
- Overall Risk Score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 30209
- Relative Direction: Rear-right
- Distance Risk Reason: Longitudinal distance is -3.34m and lateral distance is -26.98m.  Lateral distance is safe, Longitudinal distance is safe based on the recent trend.
- Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 4
- Lateral Distance Safety Score: 5
- Overall Distance Safety Score: 4.5
- Time Risk Reason: TTClong is inf and TTClat is 12.41s, suggesting safe conditions with the obstacle moving away longitudinally.
- Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 5
- Lateral Time Safety Score: 5
- Overall Time Safety Score: 5.0
- Overall Risk Score: 5
