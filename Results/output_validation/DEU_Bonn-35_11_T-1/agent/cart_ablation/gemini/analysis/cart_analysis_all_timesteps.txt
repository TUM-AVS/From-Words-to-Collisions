Here's the collision risk analysis:

**Obstacle 30196:** This obstacle shares the same lanelet (687) as the ego vehicle. Initially, it's somewhat close and moving faster than the ego vehicle, posing a potential risk. However, over the provided timesteps, the distance between the vehicles increases. This suggests the obstacle is moving away from the ego vehicle and the risk is diminishing. At t=3.5s the obstacle data is missing.

**Obstacle 30200:** This obstacle starts in a different lanelet (1641) and is not initially a concern. However, at t=3.0s, it transitions into the ego vehicle's lanelet (687), and the distance is decreasing with a risk that it could get very close to the ego vehicle in the following timesteps.  This represents a potential developing hazard, and warrants closer monitoring.

**Obstacle 30201:** This obstacle is in a different lanelet (551/1641) throughout the scenario and maintains a safe distance from the ego vehicle, showing no immediate risk of collision.

Because no obstacle is on a collision course with the ego vehicle, the risk scores are higher than 0 (collision) or 1 (extreme). There is a potential for a collision with obstacle 30200 and also because at t=3.5s the obstacle 30196 is missing from the context, I will mark it as high risk.
