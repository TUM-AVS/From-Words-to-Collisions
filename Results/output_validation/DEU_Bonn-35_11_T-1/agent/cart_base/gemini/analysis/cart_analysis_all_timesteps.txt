Obstacle 30196: Initially, this obstacle posed a potential risk as it shared the same lanelet (687) with the ego vehicle and had a higher velocity. However, over the time steps, the distance between the ego vehicle and this obstacle increases, suggesting a decreasing risk.  By the last timestep, this obstacle is no longer present in the data, implying it has moved sufficiently far away to not be considered a risk.

Obstacle 30200: This obstacle initially started in a different lanelet (1641) but transitioned to the ego vehicle's lanelet (687) at t=3.0s. While the lateral distance is not negligible, the longitudinal distance decreases notably between t=2.9s and t=3.5s. Combined with fluctuating acceleration behavior, this merits close monitoring and warrants a high-risk assessment.

Obstacle 30201: This obstacle remains in different lanelets (551 and then 1641) throughout the scenario and maintains a safe distance from the ego vehicle.  It does not pose any collision risk.
