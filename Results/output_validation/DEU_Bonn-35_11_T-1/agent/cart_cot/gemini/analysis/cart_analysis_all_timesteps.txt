Obstacle 30196 is not present in the last few timesteps, so it is assumed to be no longer a risk.

Obstacle 30200 is in the same lane as the ego vehicle and its lateral position is converging.  While it is ahead of the ego vehicle, the closing velocity suggests a medium risk if the lead vehicle were to brake heavily.

Obstacle 30201's lateral position suggests it is in a different lane and moving away from the ego vehicle.  It does not pose a significant risk.
