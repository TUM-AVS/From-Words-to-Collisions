At the most recent timestep (3.5 seconds), the ego vehicle's position and velocity, as well as those of the obstacles, indicate the potential risk levels.

1. **Obstacle 30196.0:** This obstacle is only included in the earlier timesteps, making it irrelevant for the most recent analysis.
   
2. **Obstacle 30200.0:** This obstacle is present in the same lanelet (687.0) as the ego vehicle by 3.5 seconds, and its position indicates that it is moving closer to the ego vehicle. The relative velocity with respect to the ego suggests a converging path, but its orientation and the position seem to suggest a lateral offset preventing immediate collision.

3. **Obstacle 30201.0:** This obstacle, while initially in different lanelets, has shown fast acceleration and changes in velocity indicating an approach towards the ego. By 3.5 seconds, it is now in lanelet 1641.0, separate from the ego vehicleâ€™s lanelet 687.0, reducing the immediate direct collision risk.

### Risk Analysis:
- **Obstacle 30200.0** presents a high risk (2) due to being in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle and having relative movements that could potentially lead to a collision if no corrective measures are taken. While not immediately threatening a collision in this instance, it requires attention due to its trajectory and acceleration characteristics.
- **Obstacle 30201.0** maintains its risk by existing in a separate lanelet by the end of the observation at 3.5 seconds but still warrants monitoring due to its dynamic movements.
