### Analysis:

1. **Obstacle 30200**:
   - **Position**: At 3.5s, the obstacle is at (-449.9986, -359.7496), which is very close to the ego vehicle's position (-445.8396, -363.4614).
   - **Velocity**: 13.0869 m/s, which is significantly higher than the ego's 7.6595 m/s.
   - **Acceleration**: Slightly negative (-0.0211 m/sÂ²), but still maintaining high speed.
   - **Lanelet**: Same as ego (lanelet 687.0), indicating shared lane.
   - **TTC**: The relative distance is ~4.16m (longitudinal) and ~3.71m (lateral). Given the high relative velocity (~5.43 m/s), TTC is ~0.77s, which is critically low.
   - **Risk**: **Extreme Risk (1)** due to high closing speed and shared lane.

2. **Obstacle 30201**:
   - **Position**: At 3.5s, the obstacle is at (-463.5793, -347.0713), which is further away from the ego vehicle.
   - **Velocity**: 12.3916 m/s, higher than ego but not directly converging.
   - **Lanelet**: Different lanelet (1641.0), indicating separate lane.
   - **TTC**: Lateral distance is significant, and the trajectory does not directly intersect with ego.
   - **Risk**: **Low Risk (4)** as the obstacle is not on a collision course.

3. **Obstacle 30196** (disappears after 2.7s):
   - No longer present in the latest timesteps, so no current risk.
