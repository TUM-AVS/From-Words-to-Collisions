At timestep 3.5s, obstacle 30200 is in the same lane as the ego vehicle and is closing in.  Obstacle 30201 is in a different lanelet and poses less of a risk.

Calculations for obstacle 30200 at 3.5s:

* **Ego Position:** (-445.8396, -363.4614)
* **Obstacle 30200 Position:** (-449.9986, -359.7496)
* **Longitudinal Distance:** -449.9986 - (-445.8396) = -4.159m (Obstacle is behind Ego)
* **Lateral Distance:**  -359.7496 - (-363.4614) = 3.7118m
* **Ego Velocity:** 7.6595 m/s
* **Obstacle 30200 Velocity:** 13.0869 m/s
* **Relative Longitudinal Velocity:** 13.0869 - 7.6595 = 5.4274 m/s (Obstacle is closing in)
* **TTC:** -4.159 / 5.4274 = -0.766 seconds (Likely to overtake soon)

Given the negative TTC and the relatively small lateral distance, obstacle 30200 presents a high risk. Although it's likely an overtaking maneuver, the lateral distance is not large enough for comfort, suggesting a risky overtake. We will categorize this as a high risk (2) due to the potential for a dangerous cut-in by the obstacle.  Obstacle 30201 is moving away from the ego vehicle laterally and longitudinally and hence poses a low risk.
