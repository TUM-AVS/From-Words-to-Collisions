To analyze this scenario, we will concentrate on the positions and velocities of the ego vehicle and the obstacles at 3.5 seconds, taking into account the trends observed in previous timesteps.

### Analysis:

1. **Ego Vehicle (30199.0) at 3.5 seconds**:
   - Position: (-445.8396, -363.4614)
   - Velocity: 7.6595 m/s

2. **Obstacle 1 (30200.0) at 3.5 seconds**:
   - Position: (-449.9986, -359.7496)
   - Velocity: 13.0869 m/s
   - Shares same lanelet (687.0) as the Ego vehicle.

3. **Obstacle 2 (30201.0) at 3.5 seconds**:
   - Position: (-463.5793, -347.0713)
   - Velocity: 12.3916 m/s
   - Located in a different lanelet (1641.0) than the Ego.

**Key Observations**:

- **Obstacle 1 (30200.0)** is of concern as it resides in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle and is closing in rapidly:
  - **Longitudinal Position**: The obstacle is slightly ahead of the ego vehicle in the same lanelet.
  - **Relative Velocity**: Obstacle 1 is moving faster than the ego vehicle, which signifies a potential conflict.
  - The position history shows convergence towards the ego vehicle's path.

- **Obstacle 2 (30201.0)** does not pose an immediate risk due to its lanelet difference and spatial separation from the ego vehicle.

### Risk Assessment:
- **Obstacle 1 (30200.0)** is determined to have an **Extreme Risk Level (1)** as it is closing longitudinally within the same lanelet at a higher velocity compared to the ego, indicating an imminent likelihood of conflict if no action is taken.
