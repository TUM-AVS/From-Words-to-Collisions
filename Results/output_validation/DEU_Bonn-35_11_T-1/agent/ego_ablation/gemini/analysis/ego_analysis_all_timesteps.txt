At t=3.5s, Obstacle 30200 is behind the ego vehicle at a longitudinal distance of -1.07 meters, moving towards the ego vehicle with a longitudinal relative velocity of 5.43 m/s.  The lateral distance and relative velocity are approximately zero, indicating a potential rear-end collision. Given the negative longitudinal distance and the short time to collision (TTC = distance/velocity â‰ˆ 0.2 seconds), this represents an *Extreme Risk (1)*.

Obstacle 30201 is also behind the ego vehicle but at longitudinal distance of -19.64 meters and lateral distance/velocity of zero. Although moving towards the ego vehicle, the larger distance and a TTC > 5.0 seconds translates to *Negligible Risk (5)*.
