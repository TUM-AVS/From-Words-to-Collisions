At t=3.5s, Obstacle 30200 is behind the ego vehicle at a longitudinal distance of -1.07m, meaning it is very close.  It has a relative longitudinal velocity of 5.43 m/s, indicating it is rapidly approaching the ego vehicle. Though relative acceleration is low now (0.02 m/sÂ²), the proximity and closing speed represent an extreme risk of collision.

Obstacle 30201 is also behind the ego vehicle at a longitudinal distance of -19.64 m. While it is moving towards the ego vehicle with a relative longitudinal velocity of 4.71 m/s, the larger distance provides more time to react. Given its distance and relative velocity/acceleration, it presents a high risk.


Risk Levels:
0: Collision - Physical contact occurred or unavoidable
1: Extreme Risk - Immediate collision likely
2: High Risk - Close to collision, needs quick action
3: Medium Risk - Manageable with proper reaction
4: Low Risk - Minimal risk, sufficient time to react
5: Negligible Risk - No significant risk
