### Safety analysis for timestep 3.5 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

It's crucial to note that the provided scenario information lacks adjusted distances (adjusted_d_long and adjusted_d_lat).  Therefore, the analysis will be performed using the available real distances (DTClong, DTClat), but with the understanding that the results might not be fully accurate without accounting for vehicle sizes.  Furthermore, the "exact lateral alignment or unknown case" motion description raises concerns about the accuracy of lateral movement predictions.  Ideally, more precise lateral movement information would be necessary for a robust safety assessment.

**Assumptions**: Since adjusted distances are not provided, we will assume vehicle sizes are negligible for the purpose of this analysis. This means DTClong and DTClat will be used directly as proxies for adjusted_d_long and adjusted_d_lat. This assumption is made solely due to the lack of data.  Since the lateral alignment is unknown in all cases, calculating accurate TTClat and MDClat is problematic. We will focus on longitudinal TTC (TTClong) and assume a lateral risk score of 5 for all cases based on the distance, unless the trajectory suggests otherwise.

### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 30196** (No longer present in the most recent timestep â€“ assumed to be no longer a risk)
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is not present in the latest timestep.  Assuming it has moved sufficiently far away.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Obstacle is not present in the latest timestep. Assuming no time to collision risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 30200**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is behind the ego vehicle at -1.07m longitudinally.  This is extremely close.  Even though it is behind, a slight maneuver or unexpected braking from the ego vehicle could lead to a collision.
- Distance safety score: 1
- Time Risk reason: The obstacle is rapidly approaching the ego vehicle from behind with a relative longitudinal velocity of 5.43 m/s. Given the close proximity, a collision is imminent if the obstacle doesn't brake significantly.  A very rough estimate of TTClong (using distance/relative velocity) would place it under 0.2 seconds.
- Time safety score: 1
- Overall Risk score: 1

- **Obstacle ID: 30201**
- Distance Risk reason: Located behind the ego vehicle at -19.64m longitudinally.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason:  Although approaching, it is at a safer distance than 30200. A rough estimate of TTClong puts it around 3.6 seconds.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3
