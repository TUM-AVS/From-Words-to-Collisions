At t=3.7s, Ego is in lanelet 687. Obstacle 30200 is also in lanelet 687 and approaching Ego. Obstacle 30201 is in lanelet 1641.

Obstacle 30200: This obstacle poses the most significant risk.  While not an immediate collision, the trajectories suggest a very high probability of collision in the near future. The vehicles are converging, and the distance between them is decreasing rapidly.  Even though there is still some separation, the rate of closure and their respective speeds suggest a very high risk of collision within the next few time steps if no evasive action is taken.  Therefore, I classify this as an Extreme Risk (1).

Obstacle 30201: This obstacle, though moderately close, does not present an immediate risk.  There is a notable lateral separation, meaning that a lane change by Obstacle 30201 into Ego's lane would need to occur before a collision is likely.  However, there isn't information confirming such a lane change. The trajectories do not intersect in the immediate future. Therefore, I classify this as Medium risk (3) in the short term, but the situation requires monitoring for potential lane change behavior by Obstacle 30201.
