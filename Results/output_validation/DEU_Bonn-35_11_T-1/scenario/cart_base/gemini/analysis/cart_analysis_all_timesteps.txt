Obstacle 30200 is in the same lane as the ego vehicle and rapidly approaching. The distance between them is decreasing, and while obstacle 30200's acceleration fluctuates, its overall trajectory suggests a potential collision if the ego vehicle does not react. Obstacle 30201, while in a different lanelet initially, transitions to lanelet 1641, the same as the ego vehicle and obstacle 30200.  Although not as immediately close as obstacle 30200, its trajectory warrants attention for potential future conflicts. The most pressing concern is obstacle 30200 due to its proximity and closing velocity.

  },
  "ScenarioAnalysis": {
    "IsCollisionScenario": false,
    "Reasoning": "Obstacle 30200 poses an extreme risk due to its close proximity, high closing velocity, and shared lanelet with the ego vehicle. While obstacle 30201 also shares a lanelet and could pose a risk in the future, it is not as immediately concerning as 30200."
