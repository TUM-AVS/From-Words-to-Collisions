    - **Overall Risk score**: 4

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. **Obstacle 30196** is the most critical due to its high closing speed in the same lanelet, but TTC (~4.36s) is still manageable.
2. No obstacles are on an immediate collision course (TTC < 1s).
3. All other obstacles are either static, moving away, or in non-conflicting paths.
4. Historical data shows no sudden maneuvers or erratic behavior from any obstacle.
