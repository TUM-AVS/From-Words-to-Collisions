### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:
- **Obstacle ID:** 30200.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 30200.0 is in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle and rapidly approaching.  The distance is decreasing over time.
- Distance safety score: 2
- Time Risk reason: The relative velocity suggests a high probability of a near-term collision if the current trajectories continue.
- Time safety score: 2
- Overall Risk score: 2

- **Obstacle ID:** 30201.0
- Distance Risk reason: While Obstacle 30201.0 is in a different lanelet initially, it transitions into a lanelet next to the ego vehicle. The lateral distance is significant but requires monitoring.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: The relative velocity and trajectories suggest no immediate collision risk, but future interaction is possible depending on lane changes.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4


### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. **Obstacle 30200.0:** This obstacle poses the most significant risk. It's in the same lane, the distance is closing rapidly, and the relative velocities indicate a likely collision if no evasive action is taken.
2. **Obstacle 30201.0:**  This obstacle is less concerning in the short term as it's in a different lanelet, but its movement towards a neighboring lanelet requires continued observation for potential future conflicts.  

This is not a collision scenario at the current timestep but there is high risk with obstacle 30200.0

### Summary in JSON Format:

  "CollisionObstacles": [],
  "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {
    "ObstacleID": "30200.0",
    "OverallRiskScore": 2
  },
  "ScenarioAnalysis": {
    "IsCollisionScenario": false,
    "Reasoning": "No collision at the current timestep. Obstacle 30200.0 presents a high risk due to its closing distance and velocity in the same lane. Obstacle 30201.0 is less of a concern currently due to being in a different lane but requires monitoring."
