### Obstacle Analysis:

#### Obstacle ID: 30200
- **Distance Risk reason**: At the most recent timestep (3.7 seconds), Obstacle 30200 is in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle. The position indicates close proximity with the ego vehicle, moving on a potentially converging path within the lanelet. Historically, this obstacle has been converging towards the ego vehicle, reducing lateral gap, indicating increased risk of lateral collision.
- **Distance safety score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)

- **Time Risk reason**: The relative velocity difference implies that Obstacle 30200 may come into collision with the ego vehicle soon, given its higher speed and same lanelet positioning. The obstacle's decreasing lateral distance and continued acceleration trend exacerbates the risk level.
- **Time safety score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)

- **Overall Risk score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)

#### Obstacle ID: 30201
- **Distance Risk reason**: Obstacle 30201 remains in a separate trajectory on lanelet 1641, diverging from the ego vehicle's lanelet. The distance has not significantly decreased over the observations, indicating a lack of immediate collision trajectory.
- **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)

- **Time Risk reason**: Despite moderate velocity, Obstacle 30201's trajectory maintains a consistent trajectory away from Ego's path, suggesting minimal risk of collision over the analyzed period.
- **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)

- **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low Risk)

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
The primary risk is posed by Obstacle 30200 due to its convergence into the ego's lanelet with lessening lateral distance and same forward progression; hence, it holds an extreme risk level. There is no immediate risk due to Obstacle 30201's distinct and separating motion pathway.
