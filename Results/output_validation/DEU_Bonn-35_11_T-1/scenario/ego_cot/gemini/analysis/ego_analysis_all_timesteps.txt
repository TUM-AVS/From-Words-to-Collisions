### Safety analysis for timestep 2.8s - 3.7s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

Obstacle 30200 exhibits a consistent and dangerous trend of decreasing distance to the ego vehicle over the analyzed time steps.  The relative longitudinal velocity remains positive (meaning the obstacle is closing in) and the distance shrinks from -4.79m to an eventual collision at 3.7 seconds. Although some fluctuations in relative acceleration occur, they don't significantly alter the collision course.  Obstacle 30201, while also approaching the ego vehicle, maintains a much safer distance throughout the scenario, with no immediate risk of collision.


### Obstacle Analysis:
**Timestep 2.8s - 3.6s:**
- Obstacle ID: 30200
- Distance Risk reason:  Obstacle approaching rapidly from behind, DTClong decreasing consistently.  Lateral movement not a major factor given "Exact lateral alignment or unknown case".
- Distance safety score: 2 (High Risk)
- Time Risk reason: TTC rapidly approaching zero, indicating imminent collision.
- Time safety score: 1 (Extreme Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 1 (Extreme Risk)

- Obstacle ID: 30201
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle approaching from behind but at a safe distance.  Lateral movement not a major factor.
- Distance safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
- Time Risk reason: No imminent collision risk based on current distance and relative velocity.
- Time safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 4 (Low Risk)

**Timestep 3.7s:**
- Obstacle ID: 30200
- Distance Risk reason: Collision occurs at this timestep (DTClong = 0).
- Distance safety score: 0 (Collision)
- Time Risk reason: Collision has occurred.
- Time safety score: 0 (Collision)
- Overall Risk score: 0 (Collision)

- Obstacle ID: 30201
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle approaching from behind but at a safe distance. Lateral movement not a major factor.
- Distance safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
- Time Risk reason: No imminent collision risk based on current distance and relative velocity.
- Time safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 4 (Low Risk)
