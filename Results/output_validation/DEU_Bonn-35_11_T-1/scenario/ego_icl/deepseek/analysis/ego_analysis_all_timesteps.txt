### Obstacle-by-Obstacle Analysis (Most Recent Timestep: 3.7s)

#### **Obstacle 30200**
- **Position**: Collision (longitudinal 0.00m, lateral 0.00m)
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal 5.45 m/s (approaching), Lateral 0.00 m/s (no lateral movement)
- **Motion Description**: Exact longitudinal alignment (collision occurring)
- **Trajectory Analysis**: 
  - From 2.8s to 3.7s, the longitudinal distance decreases from -4.79m to 0.00m with consistently high closing velocity (~5.2 m/s). 
  - Lateral distance remains 0.00m throughout (same-lane alignment).
  - At 3.7s, the obstacle reaches 0.00m in both dimensions, confirming a collision.
- **TTC**: 0.00s (collision already occurring)
- **MDC**: 0.00m (collision confirmed)
- **Risk Score**: **0 (Collision)**

#### **Obstacle 30201**
- **Position**: Behind (longitudinal -18.69m, lateral 0.00m)
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal 4.76 m/s (approaching), Lateral -0.66 m/s (minor lateral drift)
- **Motion Description**: Driving toward ego from behind, same-lane alignment.
- **Trajectory Analysis**: 
  - Longitudinal distance decreases from -22.76m to -18.69m over 0.9s, with closing velocity ~4.7 m/s.
  - Lateral distance remains 0.00m (no significant lateral risk).
- **TTC**: Longitudinal = 18.69 / 4.76 ≈ 3.93s (Low Risk)
- **MDC**: Lateral = 0.00m, but no closing lateral velocity → No immediate collision risk.
- **Risk Score**: **4 (Low Risk)** (Primary risk is longitudinal, but TTC > 3.0s)

### **Collision Scenario Determination**
- **Obstacle 30200** has a risk score of **0 (Collision)** at 3.7s, with confirmed 0.00m distance in both dimensions.
- **Obstacle 30201** poses no immediate threat (Low Risk).
- This is a **collision scenario** because at least one obstacle (30200) is colliding with the ego vehicle.
