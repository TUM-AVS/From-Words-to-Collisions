### Obstacle Analysis

#### Obstacle 30200
- **Position at 3.7 seconds**: 
  - Longitudinal distance: 0.00 m (collision point)
  - Lateral distance: 0.00 m
  - Relative velocity: 5.45 m/s (closing from behind)

- **Trajectory Analysis**:
  - Over previous timesteps, the distance has progressively decreased from -4.79 m to 0.00 m, indicating consistent approach.
  - Velocity has remained positive, indicating the vehicle continued to approach the ego vehicle.
  - Adjusted distances now at zero indicate physical proximity that suggests collision.

- **TTC Calculation**:
  - Since the longitudinal distance was leading to zero with a closing velocity, the Time-to-Collision (TTC) is essentially at 0 seconds, indicating an immediate collision scenario.

- **MDC Calculation**:
  - Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC) is already at 0 meters in both lateral and longitudinal dimensions.

- **Risk Score**: 0 (Collision occurring)

#### Obstacle 30201
- **Position at 3.7 seconds**: 
  - Longitudinal distance: -18.69 m (further behind)
  - Lateral distance: 0.00 m
  - Relative velocity: 4.76 m/s (approaching)

- **Trajectory Analysis**:
  - The distance has gradually decreased from -22.76 m to -18.69 m over timesteps, but trajectory doesn't bring it close enough imminently.
  - Relative velocity indicates approach but not rapid enough for immediate collision concerns.

- **TTC Calculation**:
  - TTC for longitudinal movement: distance / |relative velocity| = 18.69 / 4.76 â‰ˆ 3.93 seconds.
  - Still maintaining a safe distance, with no immediate risk of collision.

- **MDC Calculation**:
  - MDC is greater than 5 meters given current position and trajectory, suggesting no immediate risk.

- **Risk Score**: 3 (Medium Risk, monitoring required)

### Scenario Conclusion
This analysis clearly indicates that this is a collision scenario due to Obstacle 30200 having reached the collision point, which results in a risk score of 0.
