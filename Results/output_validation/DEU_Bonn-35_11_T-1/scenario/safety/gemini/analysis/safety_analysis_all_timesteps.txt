### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 30200
- Relative Direction: Behind
- Distance Risk Reason: The obstacle is very close behind the ego vehicle, with a longitudinal distance of 0.0m.  The history shows the obstacle has been rapidly approaching the ego vehicle, indicating a high risk of collision. Lateral distance is not a factor as the obstacle is directly behind.
- Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 0
- Lateral Distance Safety Score: 5
- Overall Distance Safety Score: 0.0 * 1.0 + 5.0 * (1.0 - 1.0) = 0.0
- Time Risk Reason: The TTC is 0.0 seconds longitudinally, indicating an imminent collision.  The history shows a consistently decreasing TTC.  Lateral TTC is not relevant in this scenario.
- Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 0
- Lateral Time Safety Score: 5
- Overall Time Safety Score: 0.0 * 1.0 + 5.0 * (1.0 - 1.0) = 0.0
- Overall Risk Score: 0.5 * 0.0 + 0.5 * 0.0 = 0.0 (rounded to 0)

- Obstacle ID: 30201
- Relative Direction: Behind
- Distance Risk Reason:  The obstacle is behind the ego vehicle at a longitudinal distance of -18.69m. This distance, while safe now, has been decreasing over the previous timesteps. Lateral distance is not a factor.
- Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 5
- Lateral Distance Safety Score: 5
- Overall Distance Safety Score: 5.0 * 1.0 + 5.0 * (1.0 - 1.0) = 5.0
- Time Risk Reason: The longitudinal TTC is 3.92 seconds, suggesting a low risk. However, the history shows this value has been steadily decreasing. Lateral TTC is not relevant.
- Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 4
- Lateral Time Safety Score: 5
- Overall Time Safety Score: 4.0 * 1.0 + 5.0 * (1.0 - 1.0) = 4.0
- Overall Risk Score: 0.5 * 5.0 + 0.5 * 4.0 = 4.5 (rounded to 5)
