Here's the collision risk analysis:

**Obstacle 30227:** This obstacle remains stationary throughout the scenario and is located in a different lanelet than the ego vehicle.  The y-coordinate difference suggests a comfortable lateral separation. Therefore, the risk is negligible.

**Obstacle 30229:**  Similar to Obstacle 30227, this obstacle is stationary and in a different lanelet with sufficient lateral separation, presenting no risk.

**Obstacle 30230:** This obstacle maintains a nearly constant velocity and stays within its lanelet (1514), far from the ego vehicle's path, posing negligible risk.

**Obstacle 30232:** This static obstacle is in lanelet 354, adjacent to the ego vehicle's lanelet (353 and 1515). Though close, the minimum separation distance is maintained over the duration of provided data, therefore currently poses a low risk. Monitoring this is needed as Ego changes lanelets, especially in longer term predictions.

**Obstacle 30234:** This obstacle is in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle (353) and moving with a high velocity, significantly higher than the speed of the ego.  Crucially, obstacle 30234 is closing the distance to the ego vehicle quite rapidly. The provided data shows it moving to less than 0.3 meters behind Ego within the prediction horizon, hence posing a high risk.  If this trend continues into future time steps, it may result in a collision.

**Obstacle 30236:** Located in lanelet 354 next to the ego vehicle. This obstacle is moving slowly and isn't getting significantly closer to the ego vehicle, therefore a low risk at the moment. Similar to Obstacle 30232, it warrants attention depending on Egoâ€™s longer-term trajectory and lane changes.
