Obstacle 30227: This obstacle is located in lanelet 382, while the ego vehicle is in lanelet 353/1515.  The y-coordinate difference between the ego vehicle and this obstacle remains relatively constant, suggesting they are not on a collision course. The minimal velocity and acceleration of the obstacle further reduce the risk. Risk Score: 5 (Negligible Risk)

Obstacle 30229: Similar to obstacle 30227, this obstacle is also located in a different lanelet (382) and exhibits no movement.  Risk Score: 5 (Negligible Risk)

Obstacle 30230:  Located in lanelet 1514, this obstacle maintains a safe distance and has a very low velocity. It poses no immediate threat. Risk Score: 5 (Negligible Risk)

Obstacle 30232:  This obstacle is stationary in lanelet 354. While in a neighboring lanelet, it poses no immediate threat due to its lack of motion.  Risk Score: 5 (Negligible Risk)

Obstacle 30234: This obstacle is in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle (353) and is approaching the ego vehicle rapidly from behind. The velocity of this obstacle is significantly higher than the ego vehicle's, and it is accelerating. This presents a high risk of collision in the near future. Risk Score: 2 (High Risk)

Obstacle 30236: Located in lanelet 354, this obstacle is moving slowly and decelerating.  It is not on a direct collision course and maintains a safe lateral distance. Risk Score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
