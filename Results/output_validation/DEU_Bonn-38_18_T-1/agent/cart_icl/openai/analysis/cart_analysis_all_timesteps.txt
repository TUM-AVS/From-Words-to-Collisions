To analyze the scenario, we evaluate each obstacle's position and movement relative to the ego vehicle, considering the most recent time step at 9.6 seconds. It's crucial to consider time to collision (TTC) and minimum distance to collision (MDC) to assess the risk level.

### Risk Assessment and Analysis:

1. **Obstacle 30227.0**:
   - Stationary with minimal movement over time.
   - Located far from the ego vehicle in a different lanelet.
   - Risk Level: 5 (Negligible Risk)

2. **Obstacle 30229.0**:
   - Stationary throughout all timesteps.
   - Positioned consistently far from the ego vehicle in a separate lanelet.
   - Risk Level: 5 (Negligible Risk)

3. **Obstacle 30230.0**:
   - Minimal movement, especially in a different lanelet consistently.
   - Significant lateral distance from ego vehicle.
   - Risk Level: 5 (Negligible Risk)

4. **Obstacle 30232.0**:
   - Remains stationary, and in a separate lanelet.
   - Sufficient lateral distance ensures no collision threat.
   - Risk Level: 5 (Negligible Risk)

5. **Obstacle 30234.0**:
   - Shares lanelet 353.0 with the ego vehicle initially, moving with increasing velocity.
   - High relative velocity to the ego vehicle, possibly closing in.
   - Given the significant speed differences and proximity, this poses a high risk.
   - Risk Level: 1 (Extreme Risk)

6. **Obstacle 30236.0**:
   - Minimal speed with slight negative acceleration, consistently distanced.
   - Isolated by a different lanelet.
   - Risk Level: 5 (Negligible Risk)

### Explanation for High Risk (Obstacle 30234.0):
Obstacle 30234.0 has a substantial increase in velocity, moving towards the ego vehicle's position likely sharing the same lanelet. Its speed and trajectory suggest an imminent chance of collision unless active intervention occurs.

### JSON Output:

```json
{
    "CollisionObstacles": [],
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "30234.0",
        "OverallRiskScore": 1
    },
    "HighRiskObstacle": null
}
```

This output indicates no unavoidable collisions but highlights Obstacle 30234.0 as an extreme risk due to its trajectory and relative position, demanding urgent attention from the autonomous system.
