At timestamp 9.6 seconds, the following analysis is observed for each obstacle:

* **Obstacle 30227:** Located front-right with longitudinal distance 0.59m and lateral distance -17.17m. The longitudinal distance is less than 1.0 meter and the relative longitudinal velocity is negative, indicating a high risk of collision.  Based on MDC, the risk score is 2 (High Risk). While the lateral distance suggests some separation, the primary concern arises from the converging longitudinal trajectories.

* **Obstacle 30229:**  Front-right with longitudinal distance 2.19m and lateral distance -9.84m. The MDC exceeds 1.0m and the relative velocity, while negative, allows more reaction time compared to Obstacle 30227. This obstacle represents a medium risk, scoring 3.

* **Obstacle 30230:** Located to the right with zero longitudinal distance and lateral distance -24.52m. Although longitudinal alignment exists, the significant lateral separation minimizes immediate collision risk. Risk score is 3 (Medium Risk).

* **Obstacle 30232:** Located to the right with zero longitudinal distance and -1.76 lateral distance. Similar to Obstacle 30230, lateral separation mitigates immediate collision risk, giving a risk score of 2 (High Risk).

* **Obstacle 30234:** Located behind with a longitudinal distance of -0.59m, indicating it's close to the rear of the ego vehicle. The positive relative longitudinal velocity suggests it's moving faster than the ego vehicle, resulting in closing the distance. This warrants a risk score of 2 (High Risk).

* **Obstacle 30236:** Located rear-right with longitudinal distance -12.81m and lateral distance -1.65m.  The negative longitudinal and lateral distances, combined with the negative relative velocity, shows increasing separation, indicating a negligible risk. Risk score: 5.
