* **Obstacle 30227**: Located front-right, longitudinal distance 0.59m, approaching longitudinally at -1.14 m/s. Poses a high risk due to the close proximity and approaching speed. Risk score: 2.
* **Obstacle 30229**: Located front-right, longitudinal distance 2.19m, approaching at -1.14 m/s.  Medium risk due to the approaching speed but the distance provides some buffer. Risk score: 3.
* **Obstacle 30230**: Located to the right, longitudinal distance 0m, and lateral distance -24.52m. Although longitudinally aligned with the ego vehicle (potentially beside it), the lateral distance suggests it's not an immediate collision risk. Risk score: 3.
* **Obstacle 30232**: Located to the right, longitudinal distance 0m, and lateral distance -1.76m, approaching at -1.14m/s.  This obstacle is very close laterally, and approaching longitudinally. High Risk. Risk score: 2
* **Obstacle 30234**: Located behind, longitudinal distance -0.59m, approaching rapidly from behind at 3.20 m/s.  The close proximity and high approaching speed indicate an extreme risk of collision. Risk score: 1.
* **Obstacle 30236**: Located rear-right, longitudinal distance -12.81m, moving away. No immediate risk. Risk score: 5.

Risk Levels:
0: Collision - Physical contact occurred or unavoidable
1: Extreme Risk - Immediate collision likely
2: High Risk - Close to collision, needs quick action
3: Medium Risk - Manageable with proper reaction
4: Low Risk - Minimal risk, sufficient time to react
5: Negligible Risk - No significant risk
