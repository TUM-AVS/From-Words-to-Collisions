### Safety analysis for timestep 9.6s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

**Assumptions and Clarifications:**

* **Missing Adjusted Distances:** The prompt emphasizes using *adjusted* distances (adjusted_d_long, adjusted_d_lat). However, these values are *not provided* in the scenario context.  Therefore, the analysis will be based on the provided real distances (DTClong, DTClat), but with a strong caveat that the results might be inaccurate without accounting for vehicle sizes.  The JSON output will include a field "AnalysisCaveat" to highlight this limitation.
* **TTC Calculation:**  TTC will be approximated using distance/relative velocity.  Since acceleration is provided, a more precise calculation is possible, but this approximation suffices for a qualitative assessment, especially given the missing adjusted distances.  Negative TTC values indicate the objects are moving away from each other.
* **Lateral Collision Assessment:**  Purely lateral collisions are less common than longitudinal ones. This analysis will prioritize longitudinal risk.

### Obstacle Analysis:

**- Obstacle ID: 30227**
- Distance Risk reason: Located front-right with DTClong 0.59m and DTClat 0.59m, indicating a very close proximity.
- Distance safety score: 1 (Extreme Risk)
