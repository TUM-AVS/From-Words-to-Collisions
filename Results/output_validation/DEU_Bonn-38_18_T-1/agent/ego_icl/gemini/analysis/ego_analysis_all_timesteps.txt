Obstacle 30227: Located front-right, longitudinal distance decreasing, lateral distance stable.  Lateral distance is large, so risk is primarily longitudinal. TTC = 0.59m / 1.14 m/s ≈ 0.52 seconds. MDC is approximately 0.59m.  This is **Extreme Risk (1)** due to the low TTC.

Obstacle 30229: Located front-right, longitudinal distance decreasing, lateral distance stable. Lateral distance is significant, so longitudinal motion dominates risk. TTC = 2.19m / 1.14 m/s ≈ 1.92 seconds. MDC is approximately 2.19m. This represents a **High Risk (2)**.

Obstacle 30230: Located to the right, longitudinal distance is zero, and the lateral distance is large and stable. TTC is not applicable longitudinally (distance = 0). Laterally, TTC is very large due to the large lateral distance.  MDC is approximately 24.52m. Thus, the risk is **Low (4)** given the large lateral distance and stable trajectory.

Obstacle 30232: Located to the right, longitudinal distance is zero, lateral distance is small and stable.  TTC is not applicable longitudinally.  Lateral velocity is also near zero. MDC is 1.76m. This is a **Medium Risk (3)** due to proximity, despite the currently non-converging trajectory.  Small changes in lateral movement could lead to a rapid increase in risk.

Obstacle 30234: Located behind, longitudinal distance is small and rapidly decreasing.  Lateral distance is zero, meaning same lane. TTC = 0.59m / 3.20 m/s ≈ 0.18 seconds. MDC is approximately 0.59m.  This is an **Extreme Risk (1)** due to low TTC and closing longitudinal distance.

Obstacle 30236: Located rear-right and moving away from the ego vehicle in both dimensions. This poses a **Negligible Risk (5)**.

Based on the analysis of the most recent timestep (9.6 seconds): Both Obstacles 30227 and 30234 present Extreme Risk. Since obstacle 30234 has lower TTC, it is predicted to collide first.
