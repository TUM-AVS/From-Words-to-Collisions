To analyze the risk of collision between the ego vehicle and the obstacles, the focus will be on the most recent timestamp (9.6 seconds). The analysis will involve projecting the trajectory and assessing the minimum distance to collision (MDC) and time-to-collision (TTC) using adjusted distances across obstacles. We'll proceed with a detailed analysis for each obstacle.

### Obstacle-by-Obstacle Analysis:

1. **Obstacle 30227 (Front-right)**
   - **Adjusted Longitudinal Distance (d_long):** 0.59 m
   - **Adjusted Lateral Distance (d_lat):** -17.17 m (moving laterally toward ego)
   - **Relative Longitudinal Velocity:** -1.14 m/s
   - **MDC Calculation:** Primarily longitudinal, since lateral impact is less likely given the distance. The obstacle is approaching longitudinally with a near-moderate reduction in distance.
   - **TTC:** `0.59 m / 1.14 m/s = 0.52 seconds`
   - **Risk Assessment:** Close to high risk due to converging trajectory. Extreme risk level since TTC is just above 0.5s with continuous closing.
   - **Risk Level:** 1 (Extreme Risk)

2. **Obstacle 30229 (Front-right)**
   - **Adjusted Longitudinal Distance (d_long):** 2.19 m
   - **Adjusted Lateral Distance (d_lat):** -9.84 m
   - **Relative Longitudinal Velocity:** -1.14 m/s
   - **MDC Calculation:** Longitudinally challenging. A safe lateral gap reduces immediate risk.
   - **TTC:** `2.19 m / 1.14 m/s = 1.92 seconds`
   - **Risk Assessment:** Low to medium risk due to sufficient distance and time to react.
   - **Risk Level:** 3 (Medium Risk)

3. **Obstacle 30230 (Right)**
   - **Adjusted Longitudinal Distance (d_long):** 0.00 m
   - **Adjusted Lateral Distance (d_lat):** -24.52 m (approaching laterally)
   - **Relative Longitudinal Velocity:** -1.14 m/s
   - **MDC Calculation:** Mostly lateral, but far from posing an immediate threat to collision.
   - **Risk Assessment:** Lateral motion makes immediate collision unlikely.
   - **Risk Level:** 5 (Negligible Risk)

4. **Obstacle 30232 (Right)**
   - **Adjusted Longitudinal Distance (d_long):** 0.00 m
   - **Adjusted Lateral Distance (d_lat):** -1.76 m
   - **Relative Longitudinal Velocity:** -1.14 m/s
   - **MDC Calculation:** While aligned laterally, there is no strong closing speed.
   - **Risk Assessment:** No imminent threat due to stable lateral positioning.
   - **Risk Level:** 5 (Negligible Risk)

5. **Obstacle 30234 (Behind)**
   - **Adjusted Longitudinal Distance (d_long):** -0.59 m (closing rapidly)
   - **Adjusted Lateral Distance (d_lat):** 0.00 m
   - **Relative Longitudinal Velocity:** 3.20 m/s (rapidly converging)
   - **MDC Calculation:** Very high concern for imminent impact from the rear.
   - **TTC:** Collision judging by almost zero distance.
   - **Risk Level:** 0 (Collision)

6. **Obstacle 30236 (Rear-right)**
   - **Adjusted Longitudinal Distance (d_long):** -12.81 m
   - **Adjusted Lateral Distance (d_lat):** -1.65 m
   - **Relative Longitudinal Velocity:** -1.06 m/s
   - **MDC Calculation:** Mostly negative distancing, moving away.
   - **Risk Assessment:** No immediate risk as the obstacle moves away.
   - **Risk Level:** 5 (Negligible Risk)

Combining the above analyses, obstacles 30227 and 30234 require the most urgent attention, with 30234 posing an active risk of collision. Updated risk scores:

```json
{
  "CollisionObstacle": {
    "ObstacleID": "30234",
    "OverallRiskScore": "0"
  },
  "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {
    "ObstacleID": "30227",
    "OverallRiskScore": "1"
  },
  "HighRiskObstacle": {
    "ObstacleID": null,
    "OverallRiskScore": "2"
  }  
}
```

This JSON output identifies the collision risk from Obstacle 30234 and extreme risk from Obstacle 30227, ensuring continuous monitoring or intervention is necessary to prevent potential impacts.
