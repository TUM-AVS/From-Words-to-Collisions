Obstacle 30234 is in the same lane as the ego vehicle (lanelet 353) and rapidly approaching from behind at 9.8 seconds.  Its velocity (4.77 m/s) is much higher than the ego vehicle's (1.21 m/s), and the acceleration (2.14 m/s^2) suggests this speed difference will increase. Given the closing speeds and relatively small longitudinal distance between the two, a collision is likely imminent.
