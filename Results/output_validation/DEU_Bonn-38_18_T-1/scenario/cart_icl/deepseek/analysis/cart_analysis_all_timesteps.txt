   - **Distance safety score**: 2 (High Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: High velocity (4.77 m/s) and acceleration. Potential intersection risk.
   - **Time safety score**: 2 (High Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 2 (High Risk)

8. **Obstacle ID: 30236.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: ~17.7m away in X-axis, ~1.9m in Y-axis. Moving slowly away from ego.
   - **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: Low velocity and deceleration. No immediate threat.
   - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low Risk)

9. **Obstacle ID: 30237.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: ~40.1m away in Y-axis. Moving away from ego.
   - **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: Moderate velocity but decelerating. No intersection with ego's path.
   - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low Risk)

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. **Ego Vehicle**: Moving at ~1.21 m/s in lanelet 1515.0 with slight acceleration.
2. **Critical Obstacles**: 
   - **30234.0**: High risk due to proximity and high velocity in adjacent lanelet. Needs monitoring.
   - **30232.0**: Medium risk due to static position in nearby lanelet.
3. **No Collision**: No obstacles are on a direct collision path with the ego vehicle at the current timestep.
4. **Trends**: 
   - **30234.0** is accelerating but not directly intersecting ego's path yet.
   - All other obstacles are either static or moving away.
