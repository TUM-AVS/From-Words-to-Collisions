- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 4

- Obstacle ID: 30234.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is in the same lane and approaching rapidly.  
- Distance safety score: 2
- Time Risk reason: High closing velocity, increasing risk over time.
- Time safety score: 2
- Overall Risk score: 2

- Obstacle ID: 30236.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is moderately far and in adjacent lane.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Slowing down, reducing risk.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4


### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
Obstacle 30234.0 poses the highest risk. It's in the same lane as the ego vehicle, approaching at high speed, and the distance is decreasing rapidly over the observed time steps.  While no collision is imminent at the current timestep, the rapid approach makes this a high-risk situation demanding attention. Other obstacles are either stationary or far enough away to pose no immediate threat.  This is not a collision scenario yet but could become one shortly if obstacle 30234 continues its current trajectory and velocity.

### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
  "CollisionObstacles": [],
  "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null,
  "ScenarioAnalysis": {
    "IsCollisionScenario": false,
    "Reasoning": "No obstacle has an overall risk score of 0 indicating a collision. However, obstacle 30234 presents a high risk (score 2) due to its high closing velocity in the same lane."
