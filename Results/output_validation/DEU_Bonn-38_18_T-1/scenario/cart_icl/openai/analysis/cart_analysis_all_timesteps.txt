### Obstacle Analysis:

1. **Obstacle ID: 30227**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle remains mostly stationary in its lanelet distant from Ego, showing minimal positional change over time.
   - **Distance safety score**: 5
   - **Time Risk reason**: Consistently extremely low velocity and acceleration, indicating no threat to the Ego's path.
   - **Time safety score**: 5
   - **Overall Risk score**: 5

2. **Obstacle ID: 30229**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: This obstacle is stationary and sits at a different lanelet from Ego, resulting in no interception trajectory.
   - **Distance safety score**: 5
   - **Time Risk reason**: As obstacle remains motionless, no immediate collision risk is evident.
   - **Time safety score**: 5
   - **Overall Risk score**: 5

3. **Obstacle ID: 30230**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Positioned in a non-conflicting lanelet, its slow motion away from the Ego reduces any collision risk.
   - **Distance safety score**: 5
   - **Time Risk reason**: Minimal velocity and lack of acceleration trend towards safety with negligible collision probability.
   - **Time safety score**: 5
   - **Overall Risk score**: 5

4. **Obstacle ID: 30232**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Static positioning in a different lanelet, does not present an immediate path conflict with the Ego.
   - **Distance safety score**: 5
   - **Time Risk reason**: Lack of movement maintains a negligible risk of collision.
   - **Time safety score**: 5
   - **Overall Risk score**: 5

5. **Obstacle ID: 30234**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Positioned in the same lanelet as Ego and has progressed forward rapidly, reducing risk of rear-end collision.
   - **Distance safety score**: 4
   - **Time Risk reason**: High velocity and acceleration directed away from Ego implies decreasing collision risk.
   - **Time safety score**: 4
   - **Overall Risk score**: 4

6. **Obstacle ID: 30236**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Movement direction and low speed do not pose an immediate collision threat.
   - **Distance safety score**: 5
   - **Time Risk reason**: Continuous slow movement in a different lanelet reduces the collision probability.
   - **Time safety score**: 5
   - **Overall Risk score**: 5

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
- None of the obstacles are in collision or extreme risk scenarios based on their velocities and positions concerning the Ego vehicle.
- All obstacles are either moving away, stationary, or positioned in such a way to minimize collision risk over the entire dataset.
- No collision or extreme risk is identified according to the current positioning and historical data.
