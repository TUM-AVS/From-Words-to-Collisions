### Safety analysis for timestep 8.9s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 30227
- Distance Risk reason:  Relatively close in front-right (1.36m longitudinal and lateral) and moving closer.
- Distance safety score: 2
- Time Risk reason: Approaching ego vehicle longitudinally (-0.89 m/s) with slight positive acceleration.  Lateral movement negligible.  TTC calculation unreliable due to low velocity and acceleration.
- Time safety score: 2
- Overall Risk score: 2

- Obstacle ID: 30229
- Distance Risk reason: Further away than 30227 in front-right (2.93m longitudinal and lateral) but still approaching.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: Similar longitudinal approach as 30227 but greater distance mitigates risk. TTC calculation still unreliable
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3

- Obstacle ID: 30230
- Distance Risk reason:  Zero distance reported, indicating potential overlap with ego vehicle, suggesting possible overlap between bounding boxes. Lateral movement from the right poses immediate concern. Requires further analysis to determine bounding box overlap.
- Distance safety score: 1
- Time Risk reason: Lateral and longitudinal velocity suggest collision is imminent if no action is taken. 
- Time safety score: 1
- Overall Risk score: 1

- Obstacle ID: 30232
- Distance Risk reason: Zero distance reported similarly to 30230. Longitudinal and lateral risk is high
- Distance safety score: 1
- Time Risk reason:  Longitudinal velocity indicates closing in, and lateral movement is small. Risk is imminent without intervention.
- Time safety score: 1
- Overall Risk score: 1

- Obstacle ID: 30234
- Distance Risk reason: Behind ego vehicle (-2.5m longitudinal and lateral) but approaching rapidly.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: High closing velocity (2.13m/s) poses risk.TTC is approximately 1.2 seconds.
- Time safety score: 2
- Overall Risk score: 2

- Obstacle ID: 30236
- Distance Risk reason: Far behind ego vehicle and moving further away.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Moving away from ego vehicle.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5


### Safety analysis for timestep 9.0s through 9.8s:
(Analysis follows the same structure as above, focusing on the most critical obstacles. Note that at timestep 9.8s a collision occurs.)
### Obstacle Analysis for 9.8s:
... (omitting earlier timestamps for brevity)
- Obstacle ID: 30234
- Distance Risk reason: Collision reported (0m longitudinal and lateral).
- Distance safety score: 0
- Time Risk reason: Collision occurred.
- Time safety score: 0
- Overall Risk score: 0



### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
  "CollisionObstacle": {
    "ObstacleID": "30234",
    "OverallRiskScore": "0"
  },
  "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {
    "ObstacleID": "30230",
    "OverallRiskScore": "1"
  },
    "IsCollisionScenario": true,
    "Justification": "Obstacle 30234 shows a distance of zero and a motion indicating 'Collision' at timestamp 9.8s, confirming a collision event. Additonally, obstacles 30230 and 30232 show a distance of zero at the start of the scene, indicating a potential overlap of bounding boxes (as confirmed by the 'in the Right of' direction), suggesting they should have also been identified as collision risks."

**Important Considerations:**

* **Zero Distance Values:** The zero values for distance in some obstacles likely indicate an overlap of bounding boxes rather than perfect alignment.  This requires careful attention as it can signal a high risk of collision even if not explicitly labeled as "collision."
* **TTC Calculation:** Traditional TTC calculations can be unreliable when relative velocity is very low or acceleration is significant. More sophisticated methods are required for accurate risk assessment in such situations.
* **Lateral Movement:** Lateral movement near zero distance needs special attention. Even small lateral velocities can lead to collisions if the objects are already very close or overlapping.
* **Bounding Box Overlap**: In any real-world collision analysis, the overlap or intersection of vehicle bounding boxes needs to be analyzed to determine if a true collision has occurred. Simply having a small or zero relative distance isn't enough if there isn't actual overlap between vehicle bounding boxes.
