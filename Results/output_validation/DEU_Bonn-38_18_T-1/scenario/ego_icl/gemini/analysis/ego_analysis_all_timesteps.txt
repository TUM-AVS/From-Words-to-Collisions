* **Obstacle 30227 (Front-Right):** This obstacle is approaching the ego vehicle longitudinally, but its lateral distance is large (-17.17m) and stable.  The longitudinal distance is 0.36m, indicating proximity. Given the negative lateral distance, the MDC is primarily determined by the longitudinal distance of 0.36m. The longitudinal relative velocity is -1.21 m/s. TTC = 0.36m / 1.21 m/s ≈ 0.3s. This indicates an *Extreme Risk (1)* due to the very short TTC.

* **Obstacle 30229 (Front-Right):**  Similar to Obstacle 30227, this obstacle is also approaching longitudinally with a safe lateral distance (-9.85m). The longitudinal distance is 1.96m and the relative velocity is -1.21 m/s. TTC = 1.96m / 1.21 m/s ≈ 1.6s. MDC is 1.96m. This represents a *Medium Risk (3)*.

* **Obstacle 30230 (Right):** This obstacle maintains a large and stable lateral distance of -24.52m. The longitudinal alignment (0.00m) does not pose a risk given the lateral separation. The scenario description also confirms no lateral relative motion. This is classified as *No Risk (5)*.

* **Obstacle 30232 (Right):** This obstacle is longitudinally aligned (0.00m) and has a lateral distance of -1.76m. While close, the stable lateral distance and the description "No lateral relative motion" suggest no immediate collision risk.  Given the lateral distance, we determine MDC = 1.76m.  Classifying this as a *Medium Risk (3)* due to proximity.

* **Obstacle 30234 (Collision):** This obstacle has collided with the ego vehicle. Both longitudinal and lateral distances are 0.00m at the last timestep, and the obstacle was approaching rapidly in previous timesteps. This is a clear *Collision Risk (0)*.

* **Obstacle 30236 (Rear-Right):**  This obstacle is moving away from the ego vehicle both longitudinally and laterally. There is no risk of collision.  This is *No Risk (5)*.


**Collision Scenario Determination:** Obstacle 30234 has collided with the ego vehicle. Therefore, this is definitively a collision scenario.
