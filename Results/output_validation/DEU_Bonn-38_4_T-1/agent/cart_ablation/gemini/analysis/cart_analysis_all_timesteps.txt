Here's the collision risk analysis:

**Obstacle 30227:**  This obstacle is stationary and located in a different lanelet (382) than the ego vehicle (353).  The y-coordinate difference suggests a comfortable lateral separation.  Therefore, this obstacle poses no immediate risk. *Risk Score: 5*

**Obstacle 30228:**  This obstacle is almost stationary and located in lanelet 354, adjacent to the ego vehicle's lanelet (353).  The y-coordinate difference indicates sufficient lateral separation.  Therefore, this obstacle poses no immediate risk.  *Risk Score: 5*

**Obstacle 30229:** This obstacle is moving very slowly and also located in lanelet 382,  similar to Obstacle 30227. The lateral distance is large enough to be safe. *Risk Score: 5*

**Obstacle 30230:** Appears at 3.2 seconds and beyond, located in lanelet 1514. Given its trajectory and distance from the ego vehicle, it poses no risk. *Risk Score: 5*


**Obstacle 30232:** This obstacle is in lanelet 354 (adjacent lane) and moving considerably slower than the ego vehicle, with decreasing velocity and a negative acceleration. While it is the closest obstacle in terms of y-coordinate, it's y-coordinate is higher than the ego vehicle. Assuming standard lane widths, this doesn't represent an immediate collision risk. *Risk Score: 4*

**Obstacle 30233:** This obstacle is in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle (353) and initially moving slower than ego. However, its negative acceleration may lead to it becoming stationary. In the later timesteps shown, this object becomes stationary and is located close behind the ego vehicle. This would be a High Risk obstacle. However, due to ego vehicle also having a negative acceleration, the risk of collision is reduced from Extreme to High. *Risk Score: 2*

**Obstacle 30235:** This obstacle is in lanelet 354 (adjacent lane) and moving with a similar velocity to the ego vehicle. Its trajectory shows it moving slightly away from the ego vehicle in x direction, and its higher y-coordinate indicates a safe lateral separation. This suggests a low risk. *Risk Score: 4*
