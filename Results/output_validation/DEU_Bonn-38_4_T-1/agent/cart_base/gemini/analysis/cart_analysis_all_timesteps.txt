Here's an analysis of the scenario and the resulting JSON:

**Analysis:**

* **Obstacle 30227:**  This obstacle is stationary and far from the ego vehicle's trajectory. It poses no risk. Risk score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
* **Obstacle 30228:** This obstacle is slow-moving and nearly stationary in later timesteps. Its location in lanelet 354 places it near the ego vehicle in lanelet 353, but given the distance and slow speeds, the risk is low. Risk score: 4 (Low Risk)
* **Obstacle 30229:**  Similar to 30227, this obstacle is also located in a different lanelet (382) and far from the ego vehicle's trajectory.  Risk score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
* **Obstacle 30230:** Appears at 3.2s and is located in a different lanelet (1514).  Far from the ego vehicle, posing no immediate threat.  Risk score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
* **Obstacle 30232:** This obstacle is in lanelet 354, close to the ego vehicle in lanelet 353.  Its velocity is decreasing, and the distance between the two is not closing rapidly enough to warrant a high risk. Risk score: 3 (Medium Risk)
* **Obstacle 30233:** Initially moving, this obstacle becomes stationary in the same lanelet (353) as the ego vehicle. However, the distance between the two is substantial, and the ego vehicle is decelerating. Risk score: 3 (Medium Risk).  Careful monitoring is needed, but there is still time to react.
* **Obstacle 30235:** Located in lanelet 354. This vehicle is moving at a moderate speed, relatively close to the ego vehicle, requiring attention. While not an immediate threat, its proximity and the ego vehicle's deceleration necessitate careful observation.  Risk score: 3 (Medium Risk)
