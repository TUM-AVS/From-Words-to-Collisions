### Analysis of Risky Obstacles:

1. **Obstacle 30232**:
   - **Position**: (-204.3543, 136.1255) at 3.4s, lanelet 354.0 (same lanelet as ego at earlier timesteps).
   - **Velocity**: 2.2614 m/s (decelerating).
   - **Relative Motion**: Ego is decelerating but still moving towards this obstacle. The lateral distance is small, and the obstacle is ahead in the same lane.
   - **TTC**: Estimated to be low due to closing distance and similar trajectories.
   - **Risk**: **High Risk (2)** - Urgent action needed to avoid collision.

2. **Obstacle 30233**:
   - **Position**: (-215.0806, 135.9026) at 3.4s, lanelet 353.0 (same as ego).
   - **Velocity**: 0.0 m/s (stationary).
   - **Relative Motion**: Ego is approaching this stationary obstacle. The distance is significant, but if trajectories align, risk increases.
   - **TTC**: High if paths diverge, but risk remains due to stationary nature.
   - **Risk**: **Medium Risk (3)** - Manageable with system response.

3. **Obstacle 30235**:
   - **Position**: (-187.5794, 130.8409) at 3.4s, lanelet 354.0.
   - **Velocity**: 6.5585 m/s (decelerating).
   - **Relative Motion**: Moving in the same direction as ego but ahead. Lateral distance is significant.
   - **TTC**: High due to similar direction and speed.
   - **Risk**: **Low Risk (4)** - No immediate danger.

4. **Obstacle 30229**:
   - **Position**: (-216.4072, 156.0177) at 3.4s, lanelet 382.0.
   - **Velocity**: 0.0487 m/s (nearly stationary).
   - **Relative Motion**: Far from ego's path.
   - **Risk**: **Negligible Risk (5)** - No meaningful risk.
