### Analysis

1. **Obstacle 30233 (at 3.4s):**
   - **Position:** (-215.0806, 135.9026)
   - **Velocity & Acceleration:** 0.0 m/s, 0.0 m/sÂ² (stationary)
   - **Proximity to Ego:** The ego vehicle is very close and in the same lanelet (353.0), continuously approaching a stationary obstacle.
   - **TTC and MDC Calculation:** As the ego is approaching the obstacle directly within the same lane without any velocity change from the obstacle, collision is imminent with both TTC and MDC approaching zero.
   - **Risk Assessment:** **Collision Risk (0)** due to inevitable contact without intervention.

2. **Obstacle 30232 (at 3.4s):**
   - **Position:** (-204.3543, 136.1255)
   - **Relative Velocity to Ego:** Slower than ego and on a slightly different trajectory, moving away from the ego's path.
   - **Risk Assessment:** **Low Risk** as the relative motion indicates no immediate threat.

3. **Obstacle 30235 (at 3.4s):**
   - **Position:** (-187.5794, 130.8409)
   - **Relative Velocity to Ego:** Moving faster in the opposite direction within the different lanelet.
   - **Risk Assessment:** **Low Risk** due to increasing separation.

4. **Other Obstacles:**
   - **Obstacles 30227, 30228, 30229, and 30230**: None are in close proximity to directly impact the ego vehicle within the considered timeframe.
   - **Risk Assessment:** **Negligible Risk** because of their distance and relative speeds.
