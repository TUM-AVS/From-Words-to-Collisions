At timestamp 3.4 seconds, the following analysis applies:

**Obstacle 30227:** This obstacle is located front-right of the ego vehicle, with a longitudinal distance of 10.18 meters and a lateral distance of -9.97 meters. The relative longitudinal velocity is -5.39 m/s, indicating it is moving towards the ego vehicle.  Based on the distances, MDC is assessed as 4 (Low Risk) and with the provided velocities, the TTC is approximately >5 seconds.  The overall risk is considered to be low (4).

**Obstacle 30228:**  This obstacle is very close to the ego vehicle at longitudinal 1.16 m and lateral -1.92 m front-right. The longitudinal relative velocity is -5.39 m/s.  The MDC is 2 (High risk) and TTC is less than 1 second. The overall risk is high (2).

**Obstacle 30229:** Located at longitudinal 8.66 m and lateral -17.36 m front-right, MDC is assessed as 4 (Low Risk) and TTC is greater than 5 seconds, deeming the overall risk level as low (4).

**Obstacle 30230:** Located front-right at longitudinal 7.20 m and lateral -25.05 m. Given the distances and relative velocities, the MDC and TTC indicate a low overall risk (4).

**Obstacle 30232:** Located to the right of the ego vehicle with 0 longitudinal distance and lateral -2.12 m.  Relative longitudinal and lateral velocities are small, suggesting near-parallel movement. The MDC is 2 (High risk), and the relative velocity suggest a larger TTC. Due to the lateral proximity, the overall risk is medium (3).

**Obstacle 30233:**  This obstacle is extremely close longitudinally (1.23 meters) in front and has relative longitudinal velocity -5.39 m/s. The MDC is 2 (High Risk), TTC is less than 1, therefore the overall risk is high (2).

**Obstacle 30235:**  This obstacle is located behind and to the right of the ego vehicle and moving away longitudinally. The overall risk is negligible (5).
