### Safety analysis for timestep 3.4s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

**Assumptions and Calculations:**

1. **Adjusted Distance:** Since raw DTClong and DTClat values are provided, I'm assuming they already incorporate vehicle size adjustments (like the addition of safety margins).  If this is not the case, please provide vehicle dimensions and I will recalculate. I'll refer to these as "adjusted_d_long" and "adjusted_d_lat."

2. **TTC Calculation:** TTC is calculated by dividing the adjusted distance by the relative velocity. If the relative velocity is zero or moving away (positive in our convention for longitudinal), TTC is considered infinite (or a very large number for practical purposes). This indicates no immediate risk. We perform this for both longitudinal (TTClong) and lateral (TTClat) directions.

3. **MDC Calculation:** MDC is the minimum adjusted distance observed across the provided timesteps.  We use separate MDC values for longitudinal and lateral directions (MDClong, MDClat).

4. **Overall Risk:** The Overall Risk Score is determined by considering the lowest score among proximity (based on adjusted distance), TTC, and predicted future movement based on the provided motion descriptions.


### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 30227**
    - Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is in front-right with adjusted_d_long = 10.18m and adjusted_d_lat = 10.18m, representing a safe distance.
    - Distance safety score: 5
    - Time Risk reason: Approaching longitudinally (Vrel_long = -5.39 m/s) with TTClong ≈ 1.9s.
    - Time safety score: 3
    - Overall Risk score: 3 

- **Obstacle ID: 30228**
    - Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is in front-right with adjusted_d_long = 1.16m and adjusted_d_lat = 1.16m indicating high proximity.
    - Distance safety score: 2
    - Time Risk reason: Approaching longitudinally (Vrel_long = -5.39 m/s) with TTClong ≈ 0.2s.
    - Time safety score: 1
    - Overall Risk score: 1

- **Obstacle ID: 30229**
    - Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is in front-right with adjusted_d_long = 8.66m and adjusted_d_lat = 8.66m, representing a moderately safe distance.
    - Distance safety score: 4
    - Time Risk reason: Approaching longitudinally (Vrel_long = -5.38 m/s) with TTClong ≈ 1.6s.
    - Time safety score: 3
    - Overall Risk score: 3

- **Obstacle ID: 30230**
    - Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is in front-right with adjusted_d_long = 7.20m and adjusted_d_lat = 7.20m, representing a moderately safe distance.
    - Distance safety score: 4
    - Time Risk reason: Approaching longitudinally (Vrel_long = -5.32 m/s) with TTClong ≈ 1.35s
    - Time safety score: 3
    - Overall Risk score: 3

- **Obstacle ID: 30232**
    - Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is to the right with adjusted_d_long = 0m and adjusted_d_lat = 0m meaning the vehicles are aligned longitudinally and laterally very close, indicating extreme risk.
    - Distance safety score: 1
    - Time Risk reason: Moving towards the car laterally (Vrel_lat = 0.01m/s) and approaching longitudinally (Vrel_long = -3.12 m/s). TTClong and TTClat are concerning due to very small distances.
    - Time safety score: 1
    - Overall Risk score: 1

- **Obstacle ID: 30233**
    - Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is in front with adjusted_d_long = 1.23m and adjusted_d_lat = 1.23m indicating high proximity.
    - Distance safety score: 2
    - Time Risk reason: Approaching longitudinally (Vrel_long = -5.39 m/s) with TTClong ≈ 0.2s.
    - Time safety score: 1
    - Overall Risk score: 1

- **Obstacle ID: 30235**
    - Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is behind-right with adjusted_d_long = -17.48m and adjusted_d_lat = -17.48m representing a safe distance.
    - Distance safety score: 5
    - Time Risk reason: Moving away longitudinally (Vrel_long = 1.16 m/s), suggesting no immediate longitudinal collision risk; however, it is approaching laterally (Vrel_lat = 0.4 m/s).
    - Time safety score: 5
    - Overall Risk score: 5
