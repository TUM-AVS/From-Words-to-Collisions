* **Obstacle 30227 (Front-Right):**  Longitudinal distance is decreasing across timesteps, indicating an approaching obstacle. Lateral distance is slightly increasing (moving away laterally). At the last timestep, longitudinal distance is 10.18m, relative velocity is -5.39 m/s. TTC (longitudinal) = 10.18 / 5.39 ≈ 1.89s. MDC is primarily determined by the lateral distance, which is -9.97m. Overall risk: Medium (3).

* **Obstacle 30228 (Front-Right):**  Both longitudinal and lateral distances are rapidly decreasing, indicating a high risk. At the last timestep, the longitudinal distance is 1.16m and the lateral distance is -1.92m, relative velocity is -5.39 m/s.  TTC (longitudinal) = 1.16 / 5.39 ≈ 0.22s. MDC is approximately 1.16m. Overall risk: Extreme (1).

* **Obstacle 30229 (Front-Right):**  Longitudinal distance is decreasing, but lateral distance is large and increasing slightly. At the last timestep, longitudinal distance is 8.66m, relative velocity is -5.38 m/s. TTC (longitudinal) = 8.66 / 5.38 ≈ 1.61s. MDC is primarily the lateral distance (-17.36m). Overall risk: Medium (3).

* **Obstacle 30230 (Front-Right):** Introduced in later timesteps. Longitudinal distance decreasing, but large lateral separation. At the last timestep, longitudinal distance is 7.20m, relative velocity -5.32 m/s. TTC (longitudinal) = 7.20 / 5.32 ≈ 1.35s. MDC is primarily lateral distance -25.05 m. Overall Risk: Medium (3).

* **Obstacle 30232 (Right):** Exact longitudinal alignment (0.00m) but lateral distance is moderately safe and slowly increasing. At the last timestep, lateral distance is -2.12m, relative velocity -3.12 m/s. TTC is not a primary concern here given the consistent lateral separation and motion description ("moving away"). MDC is -2.12m. Overall risk: Medium (3).

* **Obstacle 30233 (Front):**  Directly in front and rapidly approaching. At the last timestep, longitudinal distance is 1.23m, relative velocity is -5.39 m/s. TTC (longitudinal) = 1.23 / 5.39 ≈ 0.23s. Lateral distance is 0.0m (same lane). MDC is 1.23m. Overall risk: Extreme (1).

* **Obstacle 30235 (Rear-Right):** Moving away longitudinally (increasing negative distance), so low longitudinal risk. Lateral distance is moderately safe. At the last timestep, longitudinal distance is -17.48m and lateral is -2.24m, relative velocity -2.06 m/s. TTC (longitudinal) is negative and not relevant for front/rear collision. MDC is determined by lateral distance: 2.24m. Overall risk: Medium (3).
