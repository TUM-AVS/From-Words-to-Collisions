Obstacle 30233 is stationary in the same lane as the Ego vehicle, and at 3.6 seconds, their positions are very close: (-210.712, 134.2538) for Ego and (-215.0806, 135.9026) for Obstacle 30233.  Given Ego's current velocity and deceleration, a collision is highly probable in the next timestep if the deceleration is maintained. Although the y-coordinates suggest the vehicles might not directly overlap, the small x-difference, combined with Ego's movement towards Obstacle 30233, suggests a lane change maneuver might be difficult to execute safely.

Other obstacles are not an immediate concern at this timestep. Obstacle 30228 is stationary but further away laterally. Obstacles 30227 and 30229 remain distant and have negligible velocity. Obstacles 30232 and 30235, while in adjacent lanelets, are sufficiently separated longitudinally.  Obstacle 30230 is not relevant to potential collision with Ego because of lane separation.
