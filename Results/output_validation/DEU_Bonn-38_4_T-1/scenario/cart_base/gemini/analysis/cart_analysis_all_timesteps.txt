At t=3.6s, Ego is in lanelet 353.  Obstacle 30233 is also in lanelet 353, stationary, and very close to Ego.  Given Ego's current velocity and deceleration, a collision with Obstacle 30233 is highly likely in the next timestep. Obstacle 30232 is in lanelet 354 and getting closer to the ego vehicle, but it doesn't pose an immediate collision risk at this timestep, given the distances and velocities involved. Other obstacles are in different lanelets and are not considered high risk.
