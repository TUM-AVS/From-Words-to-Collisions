### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep (3.6 seconds): Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 30227.0
- Distance Risk reason: Stationary and far from ego vehicle's trajectory.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: No relative motion.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 30228.0
- Distance Risk reason: Stationary and moderately far from ego vehicle's trajectory.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: No relative motion.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 4

- Obstacle ID: 30229.0
- Distance Risk reason:  Stationary and far from ego vehicle's trajectory.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Minimal relative motion.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 30230.0
- Distance Risk reason: Far from ego vehicle and in a different lanelet.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Moving slowly and not posing a threat.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 30232.0
- Distance Risk reason: In the same lanelet as ego but sufficiently far ahead.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Moving slower than ego, increasing separation.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- Obstacle ID: 30233.0
- Distance Risk reason: Located in the same lanelet and close to the ego vehicle.  Requires monitoring.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: Stationary, therefore no immediate time-based risk.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 3

- Obstacle ID: 30235.0
- Distance Risk reason: In adjacent lanelet, moderately separated from ego vehicle.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Moving at a similar speed to ego, maintaining separation.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
No obstacle poses an immediate collision risk. Obstacle 30233 is closest and requires monitoring but is stationary, reducing immediate risk. Other obstacles are either far away or moving in a way that doesn't present an imminent danger.  This is not a collision scenario.


### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
  "CollisionObstacles": null,
  "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null,
  "ScenarioAnalysis": {
    "IsCollisionScenario": false,
    "Reasoning": "No obstacle poses an immediate collision risk at the most recent timestep. The closest obstacle (30233) is stationary, and other obstacles are sufficiently far or moving away/parallel to the ego vehicle."
  }
}
