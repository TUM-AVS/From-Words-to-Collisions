### Obstacle Analysis:

#### Obstacle ID: 30227
- **Distance Risk Reason**: The obstacle is consistently stationary at a different lanelet, never moving closer to the ego vehicle.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 5
- **Time Risk Reason**: Velocity and acceleration remain zero. No threat to the ego vehicle.
- **Time Safety Score**: 5
- **Overall Risk Score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 30228
- **Distance Risk Reason**: The obstacle remains stationary; its position remains constant over time, and it is not in the ego vehicle's lanelet.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 5
- **Time Risk Reason**: No movement, velocity, or acceleration, indicating no risk.
- **Time Safety Score**: 5
- **Overall Risk Score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 30229
- **Distance Risk Reason**: Slowly moving but at a significant lateral distance from the ego vehicle.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 4
- **Time Risk Reason**: Insignificant velocity, moving away laterally. No immediate threat.
- **Time Safety Score**: 5
- **Overall Risk Score**: 4.5

#### Obstacle ID: 30230
- **Distance Risk Reason**: Positioned significantly ahead of the ego vehicle, slight motion observed without posing a threat.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 4
- **Time Risk Reason**: Slow velocity and deceleration, causing no immediate threat trajectory-wise.
- **Time Safety Score**: 4
- **Overall Risk Score**: 4

#### Obstacle ID: 30232
- **Distance Risk Reason**: This obstacle is in close proximity, but moving in the opposite direction and slightly away.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 4
- **Time Risk Reason**: Despite relative closeness, trajectory and deceleration pattern indicate minimal risk.
- **Time Safety Score**: 4
- **Overall Risk Score**: 4

#### Obstacle ID: 30233
- **Distance Risk Reason**: Stationary and located within the same lanelet as the ego vehicle, but not obstructing its path.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 3
- **Time Risk Reason**: No movement observed, and the position is slightly behind the ego vehicle path.
- **Time Safety Score**: 4
- **Overall Risk Score**: 3.5

#### Obstacle ID: 30235
- **Distance Risk Reason**: Moves parallel at a consistent velocity and is gradually moving away in a different lanelet.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 5
- **Time Risk Reason**: Consistent decrease in speed, moving away from ego vehicle path.
- **Time Safety Score**: 5
- **Overall Risk Score**: 5

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. Over the past timesteps, the ego vehicle's trajectory reveals a consistent trend of deceleration.
2. All identified obstacles are either stationary or moving away, positioned in such a way that collision is improbable.
3. As no obstacles have demonstrated risky movement toward the ego vehicle, there is no imminent collision threat detected.
