At t=3.6s, obstacle 30228 is at a longitudinal distance of 0.09m and closing at -4.24 m/s.  It is also very close laterally (-1.92m). This indicates an extremely high risk of collision. Obstacle 30233 is also extremely close longitudinally (0.16m) and closing at -4.24 m/s with exact lateral alignment. Thus, a collision is imminent with at least one, possibly both, of these obstacles.
