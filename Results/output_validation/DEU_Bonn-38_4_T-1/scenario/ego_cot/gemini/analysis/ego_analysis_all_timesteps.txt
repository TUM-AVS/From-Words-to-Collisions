### Safety analysis for timestep 2.7s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 30227
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is at a safe distance (16.14m longitudinal and lateral) and moving towards the ego vehicle.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Approaching with a significant relative longitudinal velocity (-10.85 m/s), but decelerating (-3.44 m/s²). TTC needs further monitoring.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3

- Obstacle ID: 30228
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is at a concerning distance (7.18m longitudinal and lateral) and moving towards the ego vehicle longitudinally.
- Distance safety score: 2
- Time Risk reason: Approaching with a high relative longitudinal velocity (-10.75 m/s), but decelerating (-3.44 m/s²).  TTC is short and demands attention.
- Time safety score: 2
- Overall Risk score: 2

- Obstacle ID: 30229
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is at a moderately safe distance (14.56m longitudinal and lateral) and moving towards the ego vehicle.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: Approaching with a significant relative longitudinal velocity (-10.83 m/s) and slight lateral velocity (0.10 m/s). TTC is a concern.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3

- Obstacle ID: 30232
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle has zero longitudinal and lateral distance, indicating a potential collision.
- Distance safety score: 0
- Time Risk reason: Relative velocity indicates a collision is imminent.
- Time safety score: 0
- Overall Risk score: 0

- Obstacle ID: 30233
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is at a concerning distance (7.27m longitudinal and lateral) and moving towards the ego vehicle.
- Distance safety score: 2
- Time Risk reason: Approaching with a high relative longitudinal velocity (-10.85 m/s). TTC is very short.
- Time safety score: 2
- Overall Risk score: 2

- Obstacle ID: 30235
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is behind the ego vehicle at a safe distance and moving away longitudinally.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: No longitudinal collision risk as it is moving away.  Lateral movement towards ego is not an immediate concern.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4


### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
  "CollisionObstacle": {
    "ObstacleID": "30232",
    "OverallRiskScore": "0"
  },
  "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null,
  "IsCollisionScenario": true,
  "Justification": "Obstacle 30232 has zero distance in both longitudinal and lateral directions, indicating a collision."
}
```

**(Repeat this analysis structure for timestamps 2.8, 2.9, 3.0, 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5, and 3.6.  Remember to recalculate TTC and MDC for each timestamp and adjust risk scores and justifications accordingly. Note that the JSON summary should only include the most severe risks – a collision overrides an extreme risk, and an extreme risk overrides other risk levels.)**

For example, if at timestep 2.8, Obstacle 30233 has a very short TTC and close distance, it might be classified as "Extreme Risk (1)" if there is no collision. If a new obstacle appears with zero distance at timestep 3.0, that becomes the "CollisionObstacle" and the JSON would reflect this. If no collision is present, the JSON should indicate the lowest ID obstacle with an extreme risk.
