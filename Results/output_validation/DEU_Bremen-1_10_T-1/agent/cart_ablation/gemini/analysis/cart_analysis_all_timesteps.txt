Here's the collision risk analysis:

**Ego (30303.0):** Stationary.

**Obstacle 30294.0:**  Located in a different lanelet (1522.0) than the ego vehicle (821.0).  The y-coordinate shows it moving further away from the ego vehicle.  Presents no risk. Risk score: 5

**Obstacle 30295.0:** Located in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle (821.0). Initially, this obstacle was close to the ego vehicle and moving towards it, creating a high risk of collision. Throughout the provided timesteps, obstacle 30295 continues to approach ego's y-coordinate while moving with a positive velocity along the y-axis.  This closing behavior, combined with their shared lanelet and the relatively small difference in their x-coordinates, indicates a sustained and increasing risk. If this trend continues, a collision is highly probable. Risk score: 1

**Obstacle 30297.0:** Stationary in a different lanelet. Risk score: 5

**Obstacle 30298.0:** Stationary in a different lanelet. Risk score: 5

**Obstacle 30299.0:** Stationary in a different lanelet. Risk score: 5

**Obstacle 30301.0:** Stationary in a different lanelet. Risk score: 5

**Obstacle 30304.0:**  Stationary in a different lanelet. Risk score: 5

**Obstacle 30305.0:** Located in a different lanelet, near ego vehicle, but moving slowly and its y-coordinate is getting slightly further from the ego's. No immediate danger. Risk score: 4

**Obstacle 30306.0:** Located in a different lanelet, and its x and y coordinates are moving away from the ego's.  Risk score: 5

**Obstacle 30308.0:** Stationary in a different lanelet, close to ego in x-coordinate, but ego is stationary as well, so no risk. Risk score: 5

**Obstacle 30309.0:** Located in a different lanelet. Its x and y coordinates are moving away from the ego's. Risk score: 5

**Obstacle 30310.0:** Located in a different lanelet. Its x and y coordinates are moving away from the ego's. Risk score: 5
