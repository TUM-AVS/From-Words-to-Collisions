Obstacle 30294: Located in a different lanelet (1522) than the ego vehicle (821), and its position and velocity suggest it's moving away from the ego vehicle.  Risk score: 5 (Negligible Risk).

Obstacle 30295: Located in the same lanelet (821) as the ego vehicle.  While its initial position is somewhat close to the ego vehicle, it's moving forward and increasing its distance from the ego vehicle. Risk score: 4 (Low Risk - initially higher, decreasing over the timesteps).

Obstacle 30297, 30298, 30299, 30301, 30304: Stationary and located in different lanelets. Risk score: 5 (Negligible Risk).

Obstacle 30305: Located in a different lanelet (820) and its velocity is low and decreasing. Its trajectory isn't a direct threat to the ego vehicle. Risk score: 5 (Negligible Risk).

Obstacle 30306: Located in a different lanelet (1641) and moving. Given its trajectory and distance, it poses no immediate threat to the ego vehicle. Risk score: 5 (Negligible Risk).

Obstacle 30308: Located in a different lanelet (820) and stationary. Risk score: 5 (Negligible Risk).

Obstacle 30309: Located in a different lanelet (1642) and moving slowly and its speed is decreasing. Given its trajectory and distance, it doesn't present an immediate risk to the ego vehicle. Risk score: 5 (Negligible Risk).

Obstacle 30310: Located in a different lanelet (1643) and is moving. Given its position, velocity, and trajectory, it poses no immediate threat to the ego vehicle. Risk score: 5 (Negligible Risk).
