### Analysis

- **Obstacle 30295**: This obstacle is moving within the same lanelet as the Ego vehicle, exhibiting a velocity of 2.3051 m/s. Given their proximity and co-location within lanelet 821, this poses a potential hazard. However, due to the static nature of the Ego's speed, the immediate risk is not maximum but still significant. The overall risk assessment is moderate due to the speed of the obstacle and the same lane presence.

- **Obstacle 30306**: This obstacle is moving with a speed of 1.8293 m/s and is accelerating in a lane nearby. As its trajectory does not cross paths with Ego directly and given its relative position, the chance of collision is low with sufficient operational space.

- **Obstacle 30294**: Although moving in a different lanelet (1522.0), it's exerting a reduction in speed towards the end. Given their divergent trajectories and speed reduction, the risk of collision remains low.

Conclusively, despite some obstacles being in motion, their risk levels are downgraded due to differing lanelets or stationary behavior of the Ego vehicle. No collision is imminent.
