### Analysis of Risky Obstacles:

1. **Obstacle 30295**:
   - **Position**: (-435.2962, 304.3885) at 14.1s, same lanelet (821.0) as ego.
   - **Velocity**: 2.3051 m/s (approaching ego).
   - **Distance to Ego**: ~3.59m (calculated from positions).
   - **TTC**: ~1.56s (distance / relative velocity, assuming ego is stationary).
   - **Trend**: Distance is decreasing over time, and the obstacle is in the same lanelet.
   - **Risk**: **Extreme (1)** - High likelihood of collision if no action is taken.

2. **Obstacle 30306**:
   - **Position**: (-420.9426, 316.2734) at 14.1s, lanelet 1641.0 (adjacent to ego's lanelet).
   - **Velocity**: 1.8293 m/s (moving towards ego's general direction).
   - **Distance to Ego**: ~16.5m (calculated from positions).
   - **TTC**: ~9.02s (distance / relative velocity).
   - **Trend**: Distance is decreasing, but not as rapidly as Obstacle 30295.
   - **Risk**: **High (2)** - Close proximity and moving towards ego, but not imminent.

3. **Obstacle 30310**:
   - **Position**: (-428.2801, 310.5772) at 14.1s, lanelet 1643.0 (adjacent to ego's lanelet).
   - **Velocity**: 1.9705 m/s (moving towards ego's general direction).
   - **Distance to Ego**: ~10.8m (calculated from positions).
   - **TTC**: ~5.48s (distance / relative velocity).
   - **Trend**: Distance is decreasing, but not as rapidly as Obstacle 30295.
   - **Risk**: **High (2)** - Close proximity and moving towards ego, but not imminent.
