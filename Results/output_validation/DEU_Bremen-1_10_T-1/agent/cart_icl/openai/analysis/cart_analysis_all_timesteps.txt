To analyze this scenario, we focused on relative motion and proximity between the ego vehicle and obstacles at the most recent timestep (14.1 seconds) as well as the trajectories over previous timesteps.

### Summary Analysis of Risky Obstacles:

1. **Obstacle 30295**:
   - The obstacle is within the same lanelet as the ego vehicle (821.0).
   - During the entire interval from 13.2s to 14.1s, the relative distance between the ego and obstacle 30295 consistently decreased.
   - At 14.1 seconds, the distance between the ego and obstacle 30295 is approximately 4.86m laterally and about 3.16m longitudinally.
   - Relatively closing in fast, with TTC reducing potentially towards collision within a couple of seconds.
   - **Risk Recommendation**: Extreme Risk (1)

2. **Obstacle 30294**:
   - Obstacle located in a different lanelet (1522.0) and heading towards the ego vehicle over each timestep.
   - It remains at a relatively greater longitudinal distance compared to the critical threshold, but its proximity is decreasing at a slow rate.
   - The relative velocity is not sufficient to induce a collision imminently but needs monitoring if the decrease in relative distance continues.
   - **Risk Recommendation**: High Risk (2)

The evaluated risks consider the spatial relationship and the potential closing velocities of the obstacles relative to the ego vehicle. Obstacle 30295, being in the same lane, presents an immediate concern and hence is marked as Extreme Risk, while obstacle 30294 is marked with High Risk given its trajectory and distance from the ego vehicle. No collision has yet occurred, and appropriate measures are critical to managing the risks identified.
