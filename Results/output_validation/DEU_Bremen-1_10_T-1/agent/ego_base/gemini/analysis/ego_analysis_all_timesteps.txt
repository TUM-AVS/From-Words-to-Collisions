At timestamp 14.1s:
- **Obstacle 30294**: Located to the right of the ego vehicle, poses no immediate risk due to the lateral distance. Risk score: 5 (Negligible Risk).
- **Obstacle 30295**: Located to the left of the ego vehicle, with a small lateral distance (1.98m) and negative relative longitudinal and lateral velocity and relative longitudinal and lateral acceleration, indicating it is moving towards the ego vehicle. This warrants attention but doesn't suggest an immediate collision. Risk score: 3 (Medium Risk).
- **Obstacles 30297, 30298, 30299, 30301, 30304**: These obstacles are at a safe distance from the ego vehicle and exhibit either minimal relative motion. Risk score: 5 (Negligible Risk).
- **Obstacle 30305**: At 4.43m longitudinal and 2.06m lateral distance from the ego vehicle with negative relative velocity, indicating it's approaching, however the magnitude of the relative velocity is small and the distance is relatively safe.  Risk score: 4 (Low Risk).
- **Obstacle 30306**: Located at 13.57m longitudinal and 13.86m lateral distance, with negative relative velocity and relative acceleration, suggests that the obstacle is driving toward the ego vehicle, but the distances are significant. Risk score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- **Obstacle 30308**: Collision with the ego vehicle. Risk score: 0 (Collision).
- **Obstacle 30309**: At 10.42m longitudinal and 7.01m lateral distance and moving closer with a small negative relative velocity. This obstacle does not represent an immediate risk. Risk score: 5 (Negligible Risk).
- **Obstacle 30310**: At 6.23m longitudinal and 8.17m lateral distance, the closest obstacle apart from the colliding one. The negative relative velocity and relative acceleration values indicate movement towards the ego vehicle. Requires attention and quick action to avoid potential collision. Risk score: 2 (High Risk).


Risk Levels:
0: Collision - Physical contact occurred or unavoidable
1: Extreme Risk - Immediate collision likely
2: High Risk - Close to collision, needs quick action
3: Medium Risk - Manageable with proper reaction
4: Low Risk - Minimal risk, sufficient time to react
5: Negligible Risk - No significant risk
