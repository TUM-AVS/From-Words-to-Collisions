### Safety analysis for timestep 14.1s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

**- Obstacle ID: 30294**
- Distance Risk reason:  Obstacle is directly to the right of the ego vehicle (0m longitudinal and lateral distance), indicating a likely collision.
- Distance safety score: 0
- Time Risk reason: Although lateral velocity suggests the obstacle might be moving away, the current position indicates a collision. TTC is essentially zero.
- Time safety score: 0
- Overall Risk score: 0

**- Obstacle ID: 30295**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is directly to the left of the ego vehicle (0m longitudinal and lateral distance), indicating a likely collision.
- Distance safety score: 0
- Time Risk reason: Negative relative velocities in both longitudinal and lateral directions suggest the obstacle is moving towards the ego vehicle, increasing the risk of collision. TTC is essentially zero.
- Time safety score: 0
- Overall Risk score: 0

**- Obstacle ID: 30297**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is at a safe distance behind and to the right of the ego vehicle (-4.72m longitudinal and lateral distance).
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Zero relative velocity and acceleration suggest no immediate risk, although the trajectory should be monitored in the future. TTC is undefined but effectively infinite for now.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

**- Obstacle ID: 30298**
- Distance Risk reason: Similar to 30297, this obstacle is also at a safe distance.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason:  No immediate risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

**- Obstacle ID: 30299**
- Distance Risk reason:  Safe distance behind and to the right of the ego vehicle.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: No immediate risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

**- Obstacle ID: 30301**
- Distance Risk reason: Very close behind and to the right, though not yet colliding.
- Distance safety score: 1
- Time Risk reason: Zero relative velocity and acceleration suggest no immediate risk, although the trajectory should be monitored in the future. TTC is undefined but effectively infinite for now.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 3

**- Obstacle ID: 30304**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is far behind and to the right.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: No immediate risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

**- Obstacle ID: 30305**
- Distance Risk reason:  At a moderate distance in front and to the left.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Slow negative closing velocities. TTC is high for now.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

**- Obstacle ID: 30306**
- Distance Risk reason:  Safe distance ahead and to the left.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason:  Closing velocity but adequate TTC.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

**- Obstacle ID: 30308**
- Distance Risk reason: Collision has occurred.
- Distance safety score: 0
- Time Risk reason: Zero relative velocity and zero distance confirm the collision.
- Time safety score: 0
- Overall Risk score: 0

**- Obstacle ID: 30309**
- Distance Risk reason: Safe distance ahead and to the left.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason:  Closing velocity but adequate TTC.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

**- Obstacle ID: 30310**
- Distance Risk reason: Moderately close ahead and to the left.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason:  Closing velocity. TTC is in medium risk range.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3
