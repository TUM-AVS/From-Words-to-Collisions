Let me analyze the most recent timestep (14.1 seconds) and assess collision risks for each obstacle:

1. Obstacle 30294 (Right):
   - Lateral distance: -23.59m (moving toward ego at 0.96m/s)
   - TTC: 23.59/0.96 = 24.57s (No Risk)
   - MDC: 23.59m (No Risk)
   - Risk: 5 (No Risk)

2. Obstacle 30295 (Left):
   - Lateral distance: 1.98m (moving toward ego at 1.59m/s)
   - TTC: 1.98/1.59 = 1.25s (Medium Risk)
   - MDC: 1.98m (Medium Risk)
   - Risk: 3 (Medium Risk)

3. Obstacle 30305 (Front-left):
   - Longitudinal: 4.43m (approaching at 0.04m/s)
   - Lateral: 2.06m (approaching at 0.03m/s)
   - TTC (long): 110.75s (No Risk)
   - TTC (lat): 68.67s (No Risk)
   - MDC: min(4.43,2.06) = 2.06m (Medium Risk)
   - Risk: 3 (Medium Risk)

4. Obstacle 30306 (Front-left):
   - Longitudinal: 13.57m (approaching at 1.44m/s)
   - Lateral: 13.86m (approaching at 1.13m/s)
   - TTC (long): 9.42s (No Risk)
   - TTC (lat): 12.27s (No Risk)
   - MDC: min(13.57,13.86) = 13.57m (No Risk)
   - Risk: 5 (No Risk)

5. Obstacle 30308 (Collision):
   - Both distances: 0.00m
   - Relative velocity: 0.00m/s
   - Risk: 0 (Collision occurring)

6. Obstacle 30309 (Front-left):
   - Longitudinal: 10.42m (approaching at 0.23m/s)
   - Lateral: 7.01m (approaching at 0.18m/s)
   - TTC (long): 45.3s (No Risk)
   - TTC (lat): 38.94s (No Risk)
   - MDC: min(10.42,7.01) = 7.01m (No Risk)
   - Risk: 5 (No Risk)

7. Obstacle 30310 (Front-left):
   - Longitudinal: 6.23m (approaching at 1.54m/s)
   - Lateral: 8.17m (approaching at 1.23m/s)
   - TTC (long): 4.05s (Low Risk)
   - TTC (lat): 6.64s (No Risk)
   - MDC: min(6.23,8.17) = 6.23m (No Risk)
   - Risk: 4 (Low Risk)

Other obstacles (30297, 30298, 30299, 30301, 30304) are all moving away or stationary with large distances (No Risk).

JSON Summary:
```json
{
    "CollisionObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "30308",
        "OverallRiskScore": "0"
    },
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null,
    "PredictedCollisionObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "30308",
        "OverallRiskScore": "0"
    }
}
```

Key Findings:
- Only Obstacle 30308 is currently in collision state (0m distance in both dimensions)
- No extreme risk obstacles (score 1) detected
- Obstacle 30295 presents medium risk (score 3) from the left side
- All other obstacles present low or no risk
- The collision with 30308 appears to be ongoing based on multiple timesteps showing 0m distance
