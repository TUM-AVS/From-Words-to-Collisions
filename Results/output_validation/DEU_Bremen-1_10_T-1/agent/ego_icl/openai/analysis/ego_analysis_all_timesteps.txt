To analyze the given scenario at the most recent timestep, I will focus on the information detailed at 14.1 seconds. I will utilize the adjusted distances while simulating TTC and MDC for each obstacle regarding their relative motion.

### Obstacle-level Analysis

**Obstacle 30294:**
- **Position:** To the Right of the ego vehicle.
- **Adjusted Distance:** Longitudinal: 0.00m, Lateral: -23.59m
- **Relative Velocity:** Longitudinal: -0.39 m/s, Lateral: 0.96 m/s
- **Motion:** Aligned longitudinally, approaching laterally from the right.
- **Analysis:** With longitudinal distance at 0.00m and lateral velocity closing but at 23.59m, there is no immediate risk of collision. Lateral TTC is 23.59m / 0.96m/s ≈ 24.6s, which implies negligible risk in this dimension.
- **Risk:** 5 (Negligible Risk)

**Obstacle 30295:**
- **Position:** To the Left of the ego vehicle.
- **Adjusted Distance:** Longitudinal: 0.00m, Lateral: 1.98m
- **Relative Velocity:** Longitudinal: -1.67 m/s, Lateral: -1.59 m/s
- **Motion:** Aligned longitudinally, approaching laterally from the left.
- **Analysis:** Though longitudinal alignment is exact, the lateral approach is converging. MDC in lateral: ≈1.98m, and lateral TTC: 1.98m / 1.59m/s ≈ 1.25s. Considering both dimensions, this obstacle needs monitoring.
- **Risk:** 3 (Medium Risk)

**Obstacle 30297 to 30304 and 30306:**
- **Position:** Generally rear-right to front-left orientations with considerable distances or stationary status.
- **Analysis:** Given their considerable distances either longitudinally or laterally, or lack of any significant relative velocity, none of these obstacles pose an immediate threat.
- **Risk:** 5 (Negligible Risk)

**Obstacle 30305:**
- **Position:** Front-left
- **Adjusted Distance:** Longitudinal: 4.43m, Lateral: 2.06m
- **Relative Velocity:** Longitudinal: -0.04 m/s, Lateral: -0.03 m/s
- **Analysis:** Despite slight motions toward the ego car, both distances are above the critical thresholds, and velocities are very low; thus, no significant risk is posed.
- **Risk:** 5 (Negligible Risk)

**Obstacle 30308:**
- **Position:** Reported as collision, both distances zero.
- **Analysis:** As reported, this is identified as a collision point with the ego vehicle.
- **Risk:** 0 (Collision)

**Obstacle 30309:**
- **Position:** Front-left
- **Adjusted Distance:** Longitudinal: 10.42m, Lateral: 7.01m
- **Relative Velocity:** Longitudinal: -0.23 m/s, Lateral: -0.18 m/s
- **Analysis:** Distances are substantial, and relative reduction velocities are minimal, indicating no immediate risk.
- **Risk:** 5 (Negligible Risk)

**Obstacle 30310:**
- **Position:** Front-left
- **Adjusted Distance:** Longitudinal: 6.23m, Lateral: 8.17m
- **Relative Velocity:** Longitudinal: -1.54 m/s, Lateral: -1.23 m/s
- **Analysis:** Though the velocities suggest a closing pattern, both distances are outside immediate risk thresholds.
- **Risk:** 4 (Low Risk)

### Conclusion
In summation, the analysis identifies Obstacle 30308 as directly in collision with the ego car. Obstacle 30295 exhibits a closing position but remains at medium risk due to time for evasive action if necessary.
