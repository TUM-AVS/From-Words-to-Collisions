Obstacle 30295 is in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle and is approaching the ego vehicle, but the y-coordinate distances suggest that a collision is not imminent within the predicted timeframe.  All other obstacles are in different lanelets and pose no immediate threat. The time series data suggests that Obstacle 30295 continues to move with a positive velocity in the y-direction, while the ego vehicle remains stationary.  While there is no collision, there is a potential for medium risk with obstacle 30295 if the ego vehicle were to start moving forward. All other obstacles maintain safe distances and trajectories relative to the ego vehicle.
