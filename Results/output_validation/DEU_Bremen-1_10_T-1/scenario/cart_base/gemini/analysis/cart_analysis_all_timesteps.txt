Obstacle 30295 is in the same lanelet as the Ego and is approaching it with a decreasing but still significant velocity. Given its proximity (less than 7 meters away) and continued movement towards the Ego, a collision is likely if the Ego remains stationary.

Obstacle 30305 is very close to the Ego (around 9 meters) and in a neighboring lanelet. While its velocity is low and decreasing, its proximity and the possibility of lane changes or unexpected movements still represent a potential risk, albeit not as immediate as 30295.

Other obstacles are further away or in different lanelets and pose less immediate risk, considering the Ego's stationary state in this specific timestep.

    "IsCollisionScenario": false,
    "Reasoning": "Obstacle 30295 poses an extreme risk due to its proximity, current velocity, and trajectory in the same lanelet as the stationary Ego vehicle. While decelerating, it's likely to collide if the Ego doesn't react. Obstacle 30305 is also close but at a lower velocity and in a neighboring lanelet, representing a lesser but still notable risk."
