### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. Ego vehicle is stationary (velocity=0) at all timesteps.
2. No obstacles are on a direct collision course with ego (all either stationary, moving away, or moving parallel).
3. Closest dynamic obstacle (30295.0) is in same lanelet but moving parallel with controlled speed.
4. All other obstacles are either stationary or moving away with no convergence toward ego's position.
5. No immediate or high-risk collision scenarios detected.
