### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
No obstacle poses an immediate collision risk.  Obstacle 30295 is in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle but is moving away.  All other obstacles are either stationary, slowing down, or moving away from the ego vehicle and are in different lanelets. Thus, this is not a collision scenario.
