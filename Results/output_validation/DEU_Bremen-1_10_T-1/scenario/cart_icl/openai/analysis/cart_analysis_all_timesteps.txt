- **Obstacle ID: 30301**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Stationary, not in competition for space with the ego vehicle.
  - **Distance safety score**: 5
  - **Time Risk reason**: No movement implies no time-dependent threat.
  - **Time safety score**: 5
  - **Overall Risk score**: 5
  
- **Obstacle ID: 30304**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: On a different trajectory, negligible speed.
  - **Distance safety score**: 5
  - **Time Risk reason**: No acceleration and decisive distance from the ego's path.
  - **Time safety score**: 5
  - **Overall Risk score**: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 30305**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Same lanelet as the ego, but minor velocity changes keep it from being a high risk.
  - **Distance safety score**: 3
  - **Time Risk reason**: Slow movement with decelerating pattern.
  - **Time safety score**: 3
  - **Overall Risk score**: 3

- **Obstacle ID: 30306**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Course does not overlap with the ego vehicle significantly, moving in parallel.
  - **Distance safety score**: 4
  - **Time Risk reason**: Consistent parallel movement with minor velocity increases, not immediate threat.
  - **Time safety score**: 4
  - **Overall Risk score**: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 30308**

  - **Time Risk reason**: Zero velocity, unchanged position.
  - **Time safety score**: 5
  - **Overall Risk score**: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 30309**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Positioned aside from the ego's direct path, reducing collision risk.
  - **Distance safety score**: 4
  - **Time Risk reason**: Stable speed with deceleration, decreasing time risk.
  - **Time safety score**: 4
  - **Overall Risk score**: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 30310**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Moving on a diverging path with increasing distance over time.
  - **Distance safety score**: 4
  - **Time Risk reason**: Increasing velocity but on a non-conflicting trajectory.
  - **Time safety score**: 4
  - **Overall Risk score**: 4

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
This scenario does not depict an immediate collision risk. All obstacles show no significant threat patterns or accelerations that suggest a collision course with the ego vehicle.
