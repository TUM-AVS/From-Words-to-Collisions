Obstacle 30295 is located to the left of the ego vehicle, at a lateral distance of 1.67 meters. This close proximity represents a high risk. It is moving towards the ego vehicle both longitudinally and laterally.

Obstacle 30308 is in direct collision with the ego vehicle, indicated by a longitudinal and lateral distance of 0.00 meters. This is a critical situation.

Obstacle 30310, while not immediately colliding, presents a high risk due to its proximity and movement towards the ego vehicle. At a longitudinal distance of 5.92 meters and a lateral distance of 7.92 meters, combined with its velocity vector directed towards the ego vehicle, a high probability of collision exists if the current trajectories are maintained.
