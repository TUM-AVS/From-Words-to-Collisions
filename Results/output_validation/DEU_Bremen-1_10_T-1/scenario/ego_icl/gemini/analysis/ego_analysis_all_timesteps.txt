Obstacle-by-Obstacle Analysis at t=14.3s:

* **Obstacle 30294:** Right of ego. Longitudinal distance: 0.00m, Lateral distance: -23.42m.  Lateral velocity: 0.82 m/s (towards ego). The obstacle is far to the right and poses no immediate risk. The longitudinal alignment (0.00m) does not indicate a collision risk here because the lateral distance is large and the obstacle's longitudinal velocity is negative. Risk: 5 (No Risk)

* **Obstacle 30295:** Left of ego. Longitudinal distance: 0.00m, Lateral distance: 1.67m. Lateral velocity: -1.53m/s (away from ego). While laterally close, and longitudinally aligned, the obstacle's lateral movement *away* from the ego makes a collision unlikely.  Risk: 3 (Medium Risk)

* **Obstacles 30297, 30298, 30299, 30301, 30304:** All Rear-right and far from ego, with no relative motion or moving away. Risk: 5 (No Risk)

* **Obstacle 30305:** Front-left. Longitudinal distance: 4.42m, Lateral distance: 2.05m. Longitudinal velocity: -0.03 m/s (towards ego), Lateral velocity: -0.03 m/s (towards ego). The velocities are very small. TTC is large due to slow relative speeds. Risk: 4 (Low Risk).

* **Obstacle 30306:** Front-left. Longitudinal distance: 13.28m, Lateral distance: 13.64m.  Relative velocity indicates approaching, but the distance is large. Risk: 5 (No Risk).

* **Obstacle 30309:** Front-left. Longitudinal distance: 10.38m, Lateral distance: 6.98m.  Relative velocity indicates approaching, but the distance is large. Risk: 5 (No Risk).

* **Obstacle 30310:** Front-left. Longitudinal distance: 5.92m, Lateral distance: 7.92m. Relative velocity indicates approaching. Due to some distance it is not high risk yet. Risk: 4 (Low Risk).


* **Obstacle 30308:**  Collision with ego. Longitudinal distance: 0.00m, Lateral distance: 0.00m. The data explicitly states "Collision". Risk: 0 (Collision)
