Here's the collision risk analysis:

**Obstacle 30267.0:** This obstacle remains stationary throughout the scenario and poses no immediate threat.  Its position is consistently distant from the ego vehicle's trajectory. *Risk Score: 5*

**Obstacle 30272.0:** Similar to 30267.0, this obstacle is stationary and far from the ego vehicle's path. *Risk Score: 5*

**Obstacle 30274.0:** This obstacle is in the same lane as the ego vehicle (lanelet 1725 and 1727 respectively) and its x-coordinate is approaching the ego vehicle's x-coordinate rapidly while exhibiting fluctuating acceleration. Although a collision hasn't occurred within the provided timeframe, the closing distance and unpredictable acceleration warrant attention. There is a high risk of collision in the near future. *Risk Score: 2*

**Obstacle 30275.0:** Stationary and far from ego vehicle. *Risk Score: 5*

**Obstacle 30276.0:**  While this obstacle is moving and shows some deceleration, its trajectory doesn't intersect with the ego vehicle's within the given timeframe. Further monitoring is needed to determine if the obstacle could change lanes in future timesteps. *Risk Score: 4*

**Obstacle 30277.0:** This obstacle is moving and decelerating, but poses no immediate threat. Its y-coordinate is different and its x-coordinate will eventually approach the ego vehicle if current conditions hold true. Further trajectory data is needed.  *Risk Score: 4*

**Obstacle 30270.0:**  This obstacle appears at 5.1 seconds with a high velocity (2.6617) and substantial negative acceleration (-4.4965) in a different lanelet.  It's important to continue monitoring this obstacle. *Risk Score: 3*
