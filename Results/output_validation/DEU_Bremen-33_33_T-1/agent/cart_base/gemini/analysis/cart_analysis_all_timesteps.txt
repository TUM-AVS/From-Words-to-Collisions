Obstacle 30267.0: Stationary and relatively far from the ego vehicle, posing no immediate risk. Risk score: 5 (Negligible Risk)

Obstacle 30272.0: Stationary and further away than 30267.0, posing even less risk. Risk score: 5 (Negligible Risk)

Obstacle 30274.0: This obstacle is in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle (1725 vs 1727, likely adjacent lanes) and its x-position is approaching the ego vehicle's while moving with significant and fluctuating velocity/acceleration. It went from accelerating towards the ego vehicle to braking over subsequent timestamps. This requires close monitoring and potentially quick action if it continues on its trajectory and ego vehicle breaks heavily, leading to the x coordinates converging further. Risk score: 2 (High Risk)

Obstacle 30275.0: Stationary and far from the ego vehicle, posing no immediate risk. Risk score: 5 (Negligible Risk)

Obstacle 30276.0:  While this obstacle is moving, it's decelerating and its trajectory doesn't seem to intersect with the ego vehicle's path in the near future.  Risk score: 4 (Low Risk) although further monitoring recommended in case its trajectory changes

Obstacle 30277.0: This obstacle is also moving and decelerating, but it's further away than 30276.0 and also does not appear to intersect the ego vehicle's path. Risk score: 4 (Low Risk)

Obstacle 30270.0:  This obstacle appears only at 5.1 seconds and is moving with significant velocity towards the ego vehicle from below, potentially crossing its lane of movement based on the information available. Although it's decelerating strongly, given its initial approach speed and trajectory towards the ego vehicle, this represents a high risk. Risk score: 2 (High Risk). Note that more time steps are needed for a more comprehensive assessment.
