Obstacle 30274 shows a concerning trend. While not immediately colliding, its accelerating towards the ego vehicle and the distance is decreasing over each timestep. This warrants a high risk assessment. Obstacle 30267 is static and relatively far from the ego vehicle, posing negligible risk. Other obstacles are further away and/or moving away from the ego vehicle, thus presenting lower risks.
