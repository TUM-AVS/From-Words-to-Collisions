Obstacle 30267 is stationary and poses no immediate risk. Obstacles 30272 and 30275 are also stationary and far from the ego vehicle. Obstacle 30274, while in the same lane and accelerating, maintains a safe distance and does not pose an immediate collision risk. Obstacles 30276 and 30277 are also not a direct threat due to their lane positions and velocities. The ego vehicle's decreasing velocity and relatively stable orientation suggests a controlled slowdown, not indicative of an immediate collision.
