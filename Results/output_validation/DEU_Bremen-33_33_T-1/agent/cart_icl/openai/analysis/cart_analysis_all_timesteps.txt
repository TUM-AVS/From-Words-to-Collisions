To evaluate the risk for the given scenario at the most recent timestep (5.1 seconds), we need to analyze the relative positions, velocities, and potential for collision between the ego vehicle and each obstacle. We will use the TTC (Time To Collision) and MDC (Minimum Distance to Collision) for our analysis.

### Analysis of Obstacles:

1. **Obstacle 30267.0:**
   - Completely stationary, 4.975 meters away from the ego vehicle laterally, similar lanelet but no relative longitudinal velocity indicating no immediate risk.

2. **Obstacle 30270.0:**
   - New obstacle introduced at 5.1 seconds.
   - Positioned far from the ego vehicle, in a different lanelet, and moving with significant deceleration but parallel to the ego's path. No collision risk.

3. **Obstacle 30272.0:**
   - Stationary, located 18+ meters away directly ahead of the ego, no movement observed. Negligible risk due to lack of velocity.

4. **Obstacle 30274.0:**
   - Moving rapidly towards ego at 2.5309 m/s, with high acceleration.
   - Current longitudinal distance is roughly 5.059 meters behind the ego.
   - Expected to close the distance shortly due to high speed.
   - **High risk of imminent collision** if speed and acceleration are maintained as there is a potential for rapid catching up, though non-collision currently due to lanelet differences.

5. **Obstacle 30275.0:**
   - Stationary, located behind and around 22 meters away. No collision risk.

6. **Obstacle 30276.0 and 30277.0:**
   - Small lateral velocities; positions indicate these are further from the ego in different lanelets, reducing collision risk.

### Conclusion:
Obstacle 30274.0 presents a **high risk** due to its high closing speed and proximity. Others are either stationary or adequately distanced from the ego, posing no immediate threat.
