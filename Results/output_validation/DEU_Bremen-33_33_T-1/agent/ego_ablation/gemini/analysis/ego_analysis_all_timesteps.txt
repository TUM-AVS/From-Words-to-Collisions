At t=5.1s, Obstacle 30267 is positioned in front of the ego vehicle at a longitudinal distance of 0.80 meters, approaching at -0.03 m/s. This close proximity combined with the ongoing approach signifies a high risk of collision.  Given the MDC is less than 1 meter and the closing velocity, the TTC is likely to be very low as well. Thus, Obstacle 30267 represents a High Risk (2).

Obstacle 30274 is behind the ego vehicle at -0.65 meters and closing at 2.5 m/s. This is an extremely dangerous situation indicating a very high probability of a rear-end collision. The MDC and TTC will both be extremely low.  Thus, Obstacle 30274 represents a High Risk (2).

Obstacle 30270, 30272, 30275, 30276 and 30277 do not pose any immediate threat with sufficient distances and safe trajectories relative to the ego vehicle.
