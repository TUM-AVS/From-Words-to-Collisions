### Safety analysis for timestep 5.1s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

**Assumptions and Calculations:**

Since the provided scenario context lacks vehicle dimensions and precise trajectory information, we will make reasonable assumptions for demonstration purposes.  A simplified TTC calculation will be used: `TTC = Distance / Relative Velocity`.  We will assume vehicle widths of 1.8 meters for both ego and obstacles.

**Adjusted Distances (Illustrative):**

We need to adjust the provided distances to account for vehicle sizes. Given the diagonal distances and assuming similar vehicle sizes, we can approximate adjusted longitudinal and lateral distances by dividing the real distance by √2.  

*Example: Obstacle 30267 at 5.1s has a real distance of 0.80m.  The adjusted longitudinal and lateral distances are approximately 0.80 / 1.414 ≈ 0.57m.*

### Obstacle Analysis:

**- Obstacle ID: 30267**
- Distance Risk reason: Extremely close in front (adjusted_d_long ≈ 0.57m).
- Distance safety score: 1 (Extreme Risk)
- Time Risk reason: Approaching slowly, but very close, likely collision imminent if no action taken. Assuming a very small relative longitudinal velocity like -0.03 m/s means TTC ≈ 0.57m/0.03m/s ≈ 19s, which would incorrectly lead to a 5 score if we ignore current proximity
- Time safety score: 1 (Extreme Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 1 (Extreme Risk)

**- Obstacle ID: 30270**
- Distance Risk reason: Relatively far in front-left.
- Distance safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- Time Risk reason: Approaching but sufficient time to react.
- Time safety score: 4 (Low risk)
- Overall Risk score: 4 (Low risk)


**- Obstacle ID: 30272**
- Distance Risk reason: Far in front-right.
- Distance safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- Time Risk reason: Approaching slowly; no immediate concern.
- Time safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 5 (Negligible Risk)

**- Obstacle ID: 30274**
- Distance Risk reason: Extremely close behind (adjusted_d_long ≈ -0.46m)
- Distance safety score: 1 (Extreme Risk)
- Time Risk reason:  Approaching rapidly from behind.  Assuming a relative longitudinal velocity of 2.5 m/s gives TTC ≈ 0.46m/2.5m/s ≈ 0.18s
- Time safety score: 1 (Extreme Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 1 (Extreme Risk)

**- Obstacle ID: 30275**
- Distance Risk reason: Far in front-right.
- Distance safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- Time Risk reason: Approaching slowly; no immediate concern.
- Time safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 5 (Negligible Risk)

**- Obstacle ID: 30276**
- Distance Risk reason: Far in front-right.
- Distance safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- Time Risk reason: Minimal longitudinal movement, slow lateral approach, not a concern now
- Time safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 5 (Negligible Risk)


**- Obstacle ID: 30277**
- Distance Risk reason: Moderately far in front-right.
- Distance safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
- Time Risk reason: Moving away longitudinally, slow lateral approach, not an immediate concern.
- Time safety score: 4 (Low risk)
- Overall Risk score: 4 (Low risk)
