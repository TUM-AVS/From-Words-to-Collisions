Let me analyze each obstacle at the most recent timestep (5.1 seconds) with trajectory context from previous timesteps:

1. Obstacle 30267 (Front):
   - Longitudinal: 0.80m (decreasing slowly from 0.85m over 1s)
   - Lateral: 0.00m (aligned)
   - Relative velocity: -0.03m/s (slow approach)
   - TTC: 0.80/0.03 ≈ 26.67s (No Risk)
   - MDC: 0.80m (High Risk)
   - Motion: Slowly approaching longitudinally
   - Overall Risk: 2 (High Risk due to MDC < 1.0m)

2. Obstacle 30270 (Front-left):
   - Longitudinal: 20.45m
   - Lateral: 14.59m
   - Relative velocity: -2.64m/s (longitudinal), -0.53m/s (lateral)
   - TTC: 20.45/2.64 ≈ 7.75s (longitudinal), 14.59/0.53 ≈ 27.53s (lateral)
   - MDC: >5m in both dimensions
   - Motion: Approaching diagonally but very distant
   - Overall Risk: 5 (No Risk)

3. Obstacle 30272 (Front-right):
   - Longitudinal: 13.16m
   - Lateral: -10.62m
   - Relative velocity: -0.03m/s (negligible)
   - TTC: Not applicable (velocity near zero)
   - MDC: >5m in both dimensions
   - Motion: Nearly stationary relative to ego
   - Overall Risk: 5 (No Risk)

4. Obstacle 30274 (Behind):
   - Longitudinal: -0.65m (rapidly closing from -3.29m over 1s)
   - Lateral: 0.00m (aligned)
   - Relative velocity: 2.50m/s (fast approach)
   - TTC: 0.65/2.50 ≈ 0.26s (Extreme Risk)
   - MDC: 0.65m (High Risk)
   - Motion: Rapidly approaching from behind
   - Overall Risk: 1 (Extreme Risk due to TTC < 0.5s)

5. Obstacle 30275 (Front-right):
   - Longitudinal: 16.60m
   - Lateral: -10.84m
   - Relative velocity: -0.03m/s (negligible)
   - TTC: Not applicable
   - MDC: >5m in both dimensions
   - Motion: Nearly stationary relative to ego
   - Overall Risk: 5 (No Risk)

6. Obstacle 30276 (Front-right):
   - Longitudinal: 14.83m
   - Lateral: -18.20m
   - Relative velocity: 0.00m/s (longitudinal), 0.09m/s (lateral)
   - TTC: Not applicable longitudinally, 18.20/0.09 ≈ 202.22s laterally
   - MDC: >5m in both dimensions
   - Motion: Very slow lateral approach
   - Overall Risk: 5 (No Risk)

7. Obstacle 30277 (Front-right):
   - Longitudinal: 11.16m
   - Lateral: -18.46m
   - Relative velocity: 0.15m/s (longitudinal), 0.57m/s (lateral)
   - TTC: 18.46/0.57 ≈ 32.39s (lateral)
   - MDC: >5m in both dimensions
   - Motion: Moving away longitudinally, very slow lateral approach
   - Overall Risk: 5 (No Risk)

Predicted Collision:
- Obstacle 30274 will collide with ego vehicle within 0.26s if current trajectory continues
