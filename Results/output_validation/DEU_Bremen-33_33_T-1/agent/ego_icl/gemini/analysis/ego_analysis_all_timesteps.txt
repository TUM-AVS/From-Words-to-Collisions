At t=5.1s:

* **Obstacle 30267 (Front):** Longitudinal distance is 0.80m, lateral distance is 0.00m, and the relative longitudinal velocity is -0.03 m/s.  The obstacle is approaching very slowly or nearly stationary longitudinally while laterally aligned.  Given the slow closing velocity and almost static longitudinal distance across timesteps, TTC is high but MDC is low. The continuous decrease in distance over previous timesteps suggests a possible future collision if the trend continues.
    * MDC: 0.80m (High Risk - 2)
    * TTC: 26.67 seconds (Negligible Risk - 5)
    * Overall Risk: High (2) - prioritzing MDC.

* **Obstacle 30270 (Front-Left):**  Longitudinal distance is 20.45m, lateral distance is 14.59m. Relative longitudinal velocity is -2.64m/s and lateral velocity is -0.53m/s.  The obstacle is approaching.
    * MDC:  ≈ 17.88m (Low Risk - 4)
    * TTC Longitudinal: 7.75s (Negligible Risk - 5)
    * TTC Lateral: 27.53s (Negligible Risk - 5)
    * Overall Risk: Low (4)

* **Obstacle 30272 (Front-Right):** Longitudinal distance is 13.16m, lateral distance is -10.62m, and relative longitudinal velocity is -0.03 m/s. The obstacle is very slowly approaching longitudinally and somewhat further away laterally.  
    * MDC: ≈ 16.88 m (Low Risk - 4)
    * TTC Longitudinal: 438.67s (Negligible Risk - 5)
    * Overall Risk: Low (4)

* **Obstacle 30274 (Behind):** Longitudinal distance is -0.65m, lateral distance is 0.00m, and relative longitudinal velocity is 2.50 m/s. The obstacle is rapidly approaching from behind and is laterally aligned.  This is a very high-risk situation.
    * MDC: 0.65m (High Risk - 2)
    * TTC: 0.26s (Extreme Risk - 1)
    * Overall Risk: Extreme (1)

* **Obstacle 30275 (Front-Right):** Longitudinal distance is 16.60m, lateral distance is -10.84m, and relative longitudinal velocity is -0.03 m/s. The obstacle is approaching slowly longitudinally.
    * MDC:  ≈ 19.78m (Low Risk - 4)
    * TTC Longitudinal: 553.33s (Negligible Risk - 5)
    * Overall Risk: Low (4)

* **Obstacle 30276 (Front-Right):** Longitudinal distance is 14.83m, lateral distance is -18.20m, and relative longitudinal velocity is 0.00m/s while the lateral velocity is 0.09m/s. The obstacle is nearly stationary longitudinally and slowly approaching laterally.
    * MDC:  ≈ 23.53m (Low Risk - 4)
    * TTC Lateral: 202.22 (Negligible Risk - 5)
    * Overall Risk: Low (4)

* **Obstacle 30277 (Front-Right):** Longitudinal distance is 11.16m, lateral distance is -18.46m, and relative longitudinal velocity is 0.15 m/s while the lateral velocity is 0.57 m/s. The obstacle is moving away longitudinally and slowly approaching laterally.
    * MDC: ≈ 21.63m (Low Risk - 4)
    * TTC Lateral: 32.39s (Negligible Risk - 5)
    * Overall Risk: Low (4)
