Obstacle 30267 is stationary and located at (238.8112, -471.7674) in lanelet 380.  Ego vehicle is at (243.7817, -473.6414) in lanelet 1727.  The y-coordinates indicate some lateral separation, and the x-coordinate difference suggests longitudinal separation as well.  Given the observed trajectories, and assuming typical vehicle dimensions, this obstacle poses no immediate collision risk.

Obstacle 30270 is at (214.8792, -478.7908) in lanelet 606, moving with a velocity of 1.7648 and decelerating rapidly (-4.4965).  While this obstacle's y-coordinate suggests it is somewhat laterally separated from the ego vehicle, the decelerating suggests the ego vehicle could approach from behind. Given the longitudinal separation, a collision is possible but unlikely in the immediate future.  Therefore, it represents a medium risk and would not be listed in the JSON output.

Obstacle 30272 is stationary and located at (232.3654, -455.4477) in lanelet 343. The significant difference in y-coordinates suggests substantial lateral separation from the ego vehicle's path, indicating negligible risk.

Obstacle 30274 is at (248.1324, -475.4262) in lanelet 1725, moving with a velocity of 2.1708 and decelerating at -2.1018.  This obstacle is close to the ego vehicle in terms of y-coordinate and slightly ahead in the x-coordinate.  The closing velocity and deceleration pattern warrant attention, but there is currently enough separation to avoid a collision. This obstacle represents a medium risk and would not be listed in the JSON output.

Obstacle 30275 is stationary and located at (229.2938, -453.8859) in lanelet 344. The difference in y-coordinates suggests a significant lateral separation from the ego vehicle's path, indicating negligible risk.

Obstacle 30276 is at (233.8087, -447.8271) moving at a velocity of 0.0748 and a deceleration of -0.069. Given the observed trajectories and its slow speed and deceleration, the risk is low.

Obstacle 30277 is at (237.2312, -449.1156) moving at a velocity of 0.4958 and decelerating with -0.5555. Given its trajectory, it poses a low risk to the ego vehicle.
