Obstacle 30274 is in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle (1727 vs 1725 which are adjacent lanelets likely representing lanes in the same direction) and is approaching rapidly from behind (velocity 2.17, ego velocity 0.0225).  Given the small difference in y-coordinates and obstacle 30274's x-position being greater than the ego's, a collision is imminent if the ego vehicle doesn't accelerate or the obstacle doesn't decelerate significantly.  This represents an extreme risk. Obstacle 30267 is relatively static and close to the ego vehicle, but the data does not definitively indicate an immediate collision. However, given the proximity and the ego vehicle's low speed and deceleration, it could pose a high risk in subsequent timesteps if the ego continues to decelerate and drift closer. Other obstacles are sufficiently far away and do not pose an immediate threat.
