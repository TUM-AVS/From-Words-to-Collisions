### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 30267.0
- Distance Risk reason:  Obstacle is located behind the ego vehicle and in a different lanelet (380 vs 1727), exhibiting no movement over the observed time period.  The lateral and longitudinal separation is significant.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: The obstacle is stationary, posing no immediate time-related risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 30272.0
- Distance Risk reason:  The obstacle is located significantly to the ego vehicle's right and further ahead, in a different lanelet (343 vs 1727). It remains stationary throughout the scenario.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Stationary obstacle, no time-related risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 30274.0
- Distance Risk reason: This obstacle is in the adjacent lanelet (1725 vs 1727) and slightly behind the ego vehicle initially. However, it's moving with a positive velocity and positive acceleration, potentially closing the gap over time.  Although the distance at the last timestep isn't critically close, the relative motion warrants attention.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: While the obstacle's increasing speed could eventually lead to a risky situation if lane changes are considered, the current longitudinal separation suggests sufficient time to react.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- Obstacle ID: 30275.0
- Distance Risk reason: Similar to obstacle 30272.0, this obstacle is far to the right and ahead of the ego vehicle in a different lanelet (344 vs 1727), remaining stationary throughout the provided timesteps.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Stationary obstacle, no time-related risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 30276.0
- Distance Risk reason: This obstacle is located far to the right and ahead of the ego vehicle in different lanelet (1548 vs 1727). While its initial velocity is positive, it exhibits negative acceleration and its speed is decreasing.  Its trajectory doesn't appear to intersect with the ego vehicle's path.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: The obstacle's decreasing speed reduces any potential time-related risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 30277.0
- Distance Risk reason: Similar to obstacle 30276.0, but slightly closer laterally. It's located far to the right of the ego vehicle and in a different lanelet (1547 vs 1727), with its velocity decreasing over time. It is located far to the right and ahead of the ego vehicle in different lanelet. The distance and relative direction pose no immediate risk.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Decreasing velocity reduces time-related risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 30270.0
- Distance Risk reason: This obstacle appears only in the last two timesteps.  It's located behind the ego vehicle and to the left, in a different lanelet (606 vs 1727).  While its initial distance suggests safety, its high velocity and strong negative acceleration warrant close monitoring.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: The strong negative acceleration, though increasing the TTC, raises concerns about potential erratic behavior. More data is needed to fully assess its trajectory.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4


### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. **Most critical obstacles:** Obstacle 30274.0, due to its proximity and increasing speed in an adjacent lane, and obstacle 30270.0 due to its sudden appearance with high velocity and strong deceleration.
2. **Trajectory analysis:**  30274.0 exhibits a relatively consistent motion in its lane towards the ego vehicle, while 30270.0 only appears at 5.1 seconds, therefore we have a limited view of the potential future position and whether there is an imminent risk.
3. **Relative evaluation:** The ego vehicle maintains a slow and relatively steady movement. Obstacle 30274.0 is moving faster and accelerating, while 30270.0 is decelerating rapidly.  None of the other obstacles exhibit concerning motion.
4. **Collision determination:** No collision has occurred.  While obstacle 30274.0 presents a potential future risk, the current data doesn't suggest an imminent collision.
5. **Reasoning:** Based on the current trajectories, the ego vehicle maintains sufficient separation from obstacles in other lanelets. The primary concern is obstacle 30274.0 due to its motion in the adjacent lane; however, at the current time, the separation is still safe.
