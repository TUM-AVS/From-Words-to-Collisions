### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 30267.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is relatively close to the ego vehicle but not on a direct collision course based on current trajectories.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: Obstacle is stationary, posing no immediate time-based risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 4

- Obstacle ID: 30270.0
- Distance Risk reason: Newly appeared obstacle; relatively far from ego, current trajectory doesn't intersect with ego's.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Moving but not directly towards ego; sufficient time to react.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- Obstacle ID: 30272.0
- Distance Risk reason: Far from the ego vehicle and not in the same lane.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Stationary, no immediate threat.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 30274.0
- Distance Risk reason: In the same lane as ego, but relatively far; trajectories show potential convergence, requiring monitoring.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: Moving with significant speed; acceleration changing, increasing uncertainty; requires attention.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3

- Obstacle ID: 30275.0
- Distance Risk reason:  Far from the ego vehicle and not in the same lane.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Stationary, no immediate threat.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 30276.0
- Distance Risk reason: Far from the ego vehicle and not in the same lane.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Moving slowly, decelerating, and away from ego's path.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 30277.0
- Distance Risk reason: Far from the ego vehicle and not in the same lane.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Moving but decelerating and poses no immediate threat to ego.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 5


### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
No obstacle poses an immediate collision risk. Obstacle 30274 is in the same lane and requires careful monitoring due to its speed and changing acceleration, but it is not currently an extreme risk.  No obstacles have a risk score of 0 or 1. This is not a collision scenario.


### Summary in JSON Format:
