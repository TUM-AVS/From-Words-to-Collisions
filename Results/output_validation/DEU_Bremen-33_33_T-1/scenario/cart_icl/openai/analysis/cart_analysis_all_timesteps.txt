### Obstacle Analysis:

#### Obstacle ID: 30267.0
- **Distance Risk Reason**: This obstacle remains stationary in a separate lanelet. Its position relative to the ego vehicle is consistent with no risk of collision.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 5
- **Time Risk Reason**: No velocity or acceleration changes over time, indicating negligible risk.
- **Time Safety Score**: 5
- **Overall Risk Score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 30272.0
- **Distance Risk Reason**: This obstacle has been stationary throughout, with a significant distance from the ego vehicle, posing no immediate threat.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 5
- **Time Risk Reason**: Stationary without any velocity or acceleration changes.
- **Time Safety Score**: 5
- **Overall Risk Score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 30274.0
- **Distance Risk Reason**: This obstacle is in motion with a trajectory moving away from the ego vehicle. The distance is maintained at a safe range 
- **Distance Safety Score**: 4
- **Time Risk Reason**: The velocity and acceleration indicate it is speeding up but moving away, reducing direct collision risk over time.
- **Time Safety Score**: 4
- **Overall Risk Score**: 4

#### Obstacle ID: 30275.0
- **Distance Risk Reason**: Stationary, located significantly away from the ego vehicle, posing no risk.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 5
- **Time Risk Reason**: No change in position, velocity, or acceleration.
- **Time Safety Score**: 5
- **Overall Risk Score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 30276.0
- **Distance Risk Reason**: Slight movement with a clear, minimal distance from the ego. The trend does not show any movement toward the ego vehicle.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 4
- **Time Risk Reason**: Gradually decelerating and moving parallel or slightly away from the ego vehicle.
- **Time Safety Score**: 4
- **Overall Risk Score**: 4

#### Obstacle ID: 30277.0
- **Distance Risk Reason**: This obstacle is moving at low velocities and does not exhibit a trajectory toward the ego vehicle.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 4
- **Time Risk Reason**: With a slow decrease in speed, coupled with its path not intersecting with the egoâ€™s trajectory, the risk remains low.
- **Time Safety Score**: 4
- **Overall Risk Score**: 4

#### Obstacle ID: 30270.0
- **Distance Risk Reason**: Positioned far from the ego vehicle in a different lanelet. Its current trajectory does not present an immediate threat.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 5
- **Time Risk Reason**: High deceleration suggests reducing risk over time, even with its initial velocity.
- **Time Safety Score**: 5
- **Overall Risk Score**: 5

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
- Evaluate all obstacles for their current trajectory and historical movement relative to the ego vehicle.
- No obstacles exhibit a collision path or fall within the extreme risk category, as there is no convergence trajectory or immediate collision timeline.
