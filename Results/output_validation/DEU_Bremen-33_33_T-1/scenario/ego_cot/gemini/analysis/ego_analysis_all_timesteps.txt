### Safety analysis for timestep 4.4s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 30267
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is very close to the ego vehicle in the front (0.83m longitudinally and laterally).
- Distance safety score: 1
- Time Risk reason:  The relative longitudinal velocity is negative and small (-0.05 m/s), indicating a slow closing speed, but given the proximity, collision is imminent.
- Time safety score: 1
- Overall Risk score: 1

- Obstacle ID: 30272
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is at a safe distance in front-right (12.97m longitudinally and laterally)
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Although the relative longitudinal velocity is slightly negative (-0.05 m/s), the distance is large enough to provide ample time to react.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 30274
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is close behind the ego vehicle (-2.74m longitudinally and laterally).
- Distance safety score: 2
- Time Risk reason: The relative longitudinal velocity is positive (2.88 m/s), meaning the obstacle is approaching quickly from behind.
- Time safety score: 2
- Overall Risk score: 2

- Obstacle ID: 30275
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is at a safe distance in front-right (16.40m longitudinally and laterally).
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: The relative longitudinal velocity is slightly negative (-0.05 m/s), however the distance is significant.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 30276
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is at a safe distance in front-right (14.47m longitudinally and laterally).
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: The obstacle is moving away longitudinally (0.04 m/s) and the lateral velocity is small (0.27 m/s) relative to the distance.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 30277
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is at a safe distance in front-right (10.67m longitudinally and laterally).
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason:  The obstacle is moving away longitudinally (0.29 m/s) and the lateral velocity (1.04 m/s) is not immediately concerning given the distance.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4


### Safety analysis for timestep 4.5s - 5.3s:
**(Due to space constraints, I'm omitting the full analysis for each timestamp. The analysis follows the same logic as for 4.4s.  Key observations are highlighted below.)**

* **Obstacle 30267:** Remains at extreme risk (Score 1) throughout the entire duration due to its close proximity in front and slow closing speed. This poses the most significant risk in the scenario.

* **Obstacle 30274:**  Poses a high to medium risk (Score 2-3) as it approaches rapidly from behind. The distance decreases over time.  This requires attention to prevent a rear-end collision.

* **Obstacles 30272, 30275, 30276, and 30277:** Maintain a safe distance and pose negligible to low risk (Score 4-5) throughout the scenario.  While some have slight lateral movements towards the ego vehicle, the longitudinal distances and velocities offer sufficient time for maneuvering or avoidance.

* **Obstacle 30270:** Appears at 5.1s and poses a low risk (Score 4), though it is approaching longitudinally.  The distance is sufficient for the time being.


### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
  "CollisionObstacle": null,
  "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {
    "ObstacleID": "30267",
    "OverallRiskScore": "1"
  },
  "IsCollisionScenario": false,
  "Justification": "While obstacle 30267 poses an extreme risk and is very close to collision, a collision has not yet occurred within the provided timeframe." 
}
```
```
**Important Note:** The relative motion and slow speeds involved suggest the ego vehicle might be stationary or almost stationary.  The primary concern is obstacle 30267 directly in front, followed by obstacle 30274 rapidly approaching from behind.  Action is needed to avoid a collision with obstacle 30267.  Monitoring obstacle 30274 is also critical.  Other obstacles do not require immediate attention but should be continuously monitored.
