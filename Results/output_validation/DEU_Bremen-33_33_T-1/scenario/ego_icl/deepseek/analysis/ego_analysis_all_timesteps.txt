Let me analyze each obstacle at the most recent timestep (5.3 seconds) with trajectory context from previous timesteps:

1. Obstacle 30267 (Front):
   - Longitudinal distance: 0.80m (stable around 0.8-0.83m across timesteps)
   - Lateral distance: 0.00m (exact alignment)
   - Relative velocity: -0.02 m/s (very slowly approaching)
   - TTC: 0.80/0.02 = 40s (No Risk)
   - MDC: 0.80m (Low Risk)
   - Overall: Low Risk (4) - Stable distance with minimal approach

2. Obstacle 30270 (Front-left):
   - Longitudinal: 20.75m, Lateral: 13.36m
   - Velocities: -1.76 m/s (long), -0.28 m/s (lat)
   - TTC (long): 20.75/1.76 = 11.79s
   - TTC (lat): 13.36/0.28 = 47.71s
   - MDC: min(20.75,13.36) = 13.36m
   - Overall: No Risk (5) - Far away in both dimensions

3. Obstacle 30272 (Front-right):
   - Longitudinal: 12.57m, Lateral: -11.42m
   - Velocities: -0.02 m/s (long), 0.00 m/s (lat)
   - TTC: N/A (negligible approach)
   - MDC: min(12.57,11.42) = 11.42m
   - Overall: No Risk (5) - No meaningful approach

4. Obstacle 30274 (Behind) - CRITICAL:
   - Longitudinal: -0.19m (now overlapping with ego)
   - Lateral: 0.00m (exact alignment)
   - Velocity: 2.15 m/s (rapid approach from behind)
   - TTC: 0.19/2.15 = 0.088s (Extreme Risk)
   - MDC: 0.19m (Extreme Risk)
   - Overall: Collision (0) - Already overlapping longitudinally with high approach speed

5. Obstacle 30275 (Front-right):
   - Longitudinal: 15.99m, Lateral: -11.80m
   - Velocities: -0.02 m/s (long), 0.00 m/s (lat)
   - TTC: N/A
   - MDC: min(15.99,11.80) = 11.80m
   - Overall: No Risk (5)

6. Obstacle 30276 (Front-right):
   - Longitudinal: 13.89m, Lateral: -19.06m
   - Velocities: 0.00 m/s (long), 0.07 m/s (lat)
   - TTC (lat): 19.06/0.07 = 272.29s
   - MDC: 13.89m
   - Overall: No Risk (5)

7. Obstacle 30277 (Front-right):
   - Longitudinal: 10.24m, Lateral: -19.05m
   - Velocities: 0.15 m/s (long - moving away), 0.47 m/s (lat)
   - TTC (lat): 19.05/0.47 = 40.53s
   - MDC: 10.24m
   - Overall: No Risk (5)
