Obstacle-by-Obstacle Analysis at t=5.3 seconds:

* **Obstacle 30267 (Front):**  This obstacle is directly in front of the ego vehicle (lateral distance = 0.00m) at a longitudinal distance of 0.80m.  The longitudinal relative velocity is -0.02 m/s, indicating that the obstacle is very slowly moving closer. Over the past few timesteps, the longitudinal distance has been consistently decreasing, though very gradually. The MDC is 0.80m.

    * TTC (longitudinal): Not applicable for collision assessment since the relative velocity is negative.
    * Risk Assessment:  Given the small longitudinal distance (0.80m) and the persistent, albeit slow, closing motion, the risk level is considered High (2).

* **Obstacle 30270 (Front-Left):** This obstacle is at a longitudinal distance of 20.75m and a lateral distance of 13.36m. Both longitudinal and lateral relative velocities are negative, meaning the obstacle is moving away from the ego vehicle. It does not pose an immediate threat.

    * TTC: Not applicable for collision assessment since the relative velocity is negative.
    * MDC: > 5.0m
    * Risk Assessment: No Risk (5)

* **Obstacle 30272 (Front-Right):**  Located 12.57m longitudinally and -11.42m laterally, this obstacle is moving slowly towards the ego vehicle longitudinally (-0.02 m/s). However, the lateral distance is substantial, and there's no lateral relative movement.

    * TTC (longitudinal): Not applicable for collision assessment since the relative velocity is negative.
    * MDC: > 5.0m
    * Risk Assessment: No Risk (5)

* **Obstacle 30274 (Behind):** This obstacle is very close behind the ego vehicle at -0.19m longitudinally with a lateral distance of 0.00m, indicating alignment in the same lane. The longitudinal relative velocity is 2.15 m/s, meaning it's rapidly approaching.  The trajectory across the timesteps clearly shows a closing motion from behind.

    * TTC (longitudinal): -0.19m / 2.15m/s â‰ˆ -0.09 seconds. The negative TTC value indicates the obstacle is already very close but relative velocity suggests potential for collision if trajectory continues. Since MDC is extremely low, we consider the collision risk high despite negative TTC
    * MDC: 0.19m
    * Risk Assessment: Extreme Risk (1) due to the very small MDC and positive closing velocity.


* **Obstacle 30275 (Front-Right):** Similar to Obstacle 30272, this one is also far enough away and moving slowly.

    * TTC: Not applicable for collision assessment since the relative velocity is negative.
    * MDC: > 5.0m
    * Risk Assessment: No Risk (5)

* **Obstacle 30276 (Front-Right):**  With a longitudinal distance of 13.89m and a lateral distance of -19.06m, and slow movement away longitudinally and towards the ego car laterally (0.07 m/s), this obstacle poses no immediate risk. 

    * TTC: Not applicable for collision assessment since the relative velocity is negative.
    * MDC: > 5.0m
    * Risk Assessment: No Risk (5)

* **Obstacle 30277 (Front-Right):** This obstacle is also far enough away and moving slowly, presenting no immediate risk.

    * TTC: Not applicable for collision assessment since the relative velocity is negative.
    * MDC: > 5.0m
    * Risk Assessment: No Risk (5)


Collision Scenario Determination:

Yes, this is a collision scenario. Obstacle 30274 has an Extreme Risk (1) assessment due to its very close proximity behind the ego vehicle (0.19m), its rapid approach (2.15 m/s), and clear closing trajectory. This meets the criteria for a collision scenario.
