### Obstacle-by-Obstacle Analysis

**Obstacle 30267:**
- **Relative Position:** Front
- **Adjusted Longitudinal Distance:** 0.80 m
- **Adjusted Lateral Distance:** 0.00 m
- **Relative Longitudinal Velocity:** -0.02 m/s (approaching)
- **Trajectory Analysis:** Over the last 10 timesteps, the longitudinal distance has stabilized and decreased slightly, with a consistent very low negative velocity.
- **MDC:** 0.80 m (because lateral distance is 0 m, focus on longitudinal distance)
- **TTC Calculation for Longitudinal:** Approximately 40 seconds (0.80m / 0.02 m/s); typically not calculated when relative velocity is negative as TTC suggests increasing distance or stabilization.
- **Risk Assessment:** There's longitudinal alignment and closing distance, risk levels are:
  - MDC: 0.8m → High Risk (2)
  - TTC: 40s → No Risk (5)
  - Overall: High Risk (2) focusing on the higher proximity risk.

**Obstacle 30270:**
- **Relative Position:** Front-left
- **Adjusted Longitudinal Distance:** 20.75 m
- **Adjusted Lateral Distance:** 13.36 m
- **Relative Longitudinal Velocity:** -1.76 m/s (approaching)
- **Relative Lateral Velocity:** -0.28 m/s (approaching)
- **Trajectory Analysis:** Similar velocities suggest a diagonal approach.
- **MDC Calculation:** Higher dimension focus on lateral due to approach.
- **TTC Calculation:** Lateral: 13.36m / 0.28m/s ≈ 47.71s; Longitudinal: 20.75m / 1.76m/s ≈ 11.79s
- **Risk Assessment:** No immediate collision risk due to long TTC:
  - MDC and TTC both provide No Risk (5)
  - Overall Risk: No Risk (5)

**Obstacle 30272:**
- **Relative Position:** Front-right
- **Adjusted Longitudinal Distance:** 12.57 m
- **Adjusted Lateral Distance:** 11.42 m
- **Relative Longitudinal Velocity:** -0.02 m/s (approaching)
- **Trajectory Analysis:** Minimal change in position, indicating stable distances.
- **MDC Calculation:** Consider stable dimensions.
- **TTC Calculation:** Approximately infinite due to minimal velocity.
- **Risk Assessment:** No immediate risk:
  - Overall: No Risk (5)

**Obstacle 30274:**
- **Relative Position:** Behind
- **Adjusted Longitudinal Distance:** -0.19 m
- **Adjusted Lateral Distance:** 0.00 m (aligns but comes from behind)
- **Relative Longitudinal Velocity:** 2.15 m/s (approaching)
- **Trajectory Analysis:** Progressively moving closer from behind.
- **MDC Calculation:** Immediate proximity indicates high risk:
  - Longitudinal distance approaching 0 with increasing velocity.
- **TTC Calculation:** Negative suggesting convergence.
- **Risk Assessment:**
  - MDC and Velocity convergence indicate Extreme Risk:
  - Overall: Extreme Risk (1)

**Obstacle 30275:**
- **Relative Position:** Front-right
- **Adjusted Longitudinal Distance:** 15.99 m
- **Adjusted Lateral Distance:** 11.80 m
- **Relative Longitudinal Velocity:** -0.02 m/s (approaching)
- **Trajectory Analysis:** Stable approach indicates no imminent collision risk.
- **MDC Calculation:** Focus on maintaining steady paths further reducing risk.
- **Risk Assessment:** No Risk:
  - Overall: No Risk (5)

**Obstacle 30276:**
- **Relative Position:** Front-right
- **Adjusted Longitudinal Distance:** 13.89 m
- **Adjusted Lateral Distance:** 19.06 m
- **Relative Longitudinal Velocity:** 0.00 m/s (moving away)
- **Trajectory Analysis:** The obstacle's position and velocity clarify movement away in both dimensions.
- **Risk Assessment:** Lateral movement provides:
  - Overall: No Risk (5)

**Obstacle 30277:**
- **Relative Position:** Front-right
- **Adjusted Longitudinal Distance:** 10.24 m
- **Adjusted Lateral Distance:** 19.05 m
- **Relative Longitudinal Velocity:** 0.15 m/s (moving away)
- **Trajectory Analysis:** Converging laterally but far in distance, risk is minimal.
- **Risk Assessment:** Mostly moving away:
  - Overall: No Risk (5)

### Scenario Conclusion
The overall analysis confirms that **Obstacles 30267** has a high risk but mainly under control given stability, while **Obstacle 30274** is at an **Extreme Risk (1)** indicating the greatest potential tor collision given its trajectory from behind.
