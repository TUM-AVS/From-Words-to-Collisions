### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
    - Obstacle ID: 30267
    - Relative Direction: Front
    - Distance Risk Reason: DTClong is 0.80m, indicating extreme risk.  This has remained consistently close over the past several timesteps. DTClat is 0.00m meaning no lateral risk, as the obstacle is directly in front.
    - Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 1
    - Lateral Distance Safety Score: 5
    - Overall Distance Safety Score: 1.0  (1 * 1 + 5 * 0)
    - Time Risk Reason: TTClong is 35.73s, indicating negligible risk. TTClat is 0.00s which isn't relevant in this front direction context as the obstacle is not approaching laterally. The high TTClong suggests the obstacle is either stationary or moving very slowly relative to the ego vehicle.
    - Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 5
    - Lateral Time Safety Score: 0
    - Overall Time Safety Score: 5.0 (5 * 1 + 0 * 0)
    - Overall Risk Score: 3 (0.5 * 1 + 0.5 * 5 = 3)

    - Obstacle ID: 30270
    - Relative Direction: Front-left
    - Distance Risk Reason: DTClong is 20.75m and DTClat is 13.36m, both suggesting negligible risk. The obstacle is at a safe distance both longitudinally and laterally.
    - Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 5
    - Lateral Distance Safety Score: 5
    - Overall Distance Safety Score: 5.0 (5 * 0.5 + 5 * 0.5)
    - Time Risk Reason: TTClong is 11.76s and TTClat is 47.47s. Both values are high, signifying negligible risk as the obstacle is far away and not on a direct collision course.
    - Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 5
    - Lateral Time Safety Score: 5
    - Overall Time Safety Score: 5.0 (5 * 0.5 + 5 * 0.5)
    - Overall Risk Score: 5 (0.5 * 5 + 0.5 * 5 = 5)

    - Obstacle ID: 30272
    - Relative Direction: Front-right
    - Distance Risk Reason: DTClong is 12.57m and DTClat is -11.42m, both indicating negligible risk due to ample distance. The negative DTClat signifies the obstacle is to the right of the ego vehicle.
    - Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 5
    - Lateral Distance Safety Score: 5
    - Overall Distance Safety Score: 5.0 (5 * 0.5 + 5 * 0.5)
    - Time Risk Reason: TTClong is 558.65s and TTClat is inf, both indicating negligible risk. The extremely high TTClong and infinite TTClat confirm that the obstacle is not a threat in the foreseeable future.
    - Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 5
    - Lateral Time Safety Score: 5
    - Overall Time Safety Score: 5.0 (5 * 0.5 + 5 * 0.5)
    - Overall Risk Score: 5 (0.5 * 5 + 0.5 * 5 = 5)

    - Obstacle ID: 30274
    - Relative Direction: Behind
    - Distance Risk Reason: DTClong is -0.19m suggesting imminent collision risk. The negative value signifies that the obstacle is behind the ego vehicle and extremely close. DTClat is 0.00m and not relevant in this rear-end scenario as the obstacle is directly behind.
    - Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 0
    - Lateral Distance Safety Score: 5
    - Overall Distance Safety Score: 0.0 (0 * 1 + 5 * 0)
    - Time Risk Reason: TTClong is 0.09s suggesting imminent collision. TTClat is 0.00s and irrelevant in this context. The very low TTClong signifies a high probability of a rear-end collision unless immediate action is taken.
    - Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 0
    - Lateral Time Safety Score: 0
    - Overall Time Safety Score: 0.0 (0 * 1 + 0 * 0)
    - Overall Risk Score: 0 (0.5 * 0 + 0.5 * 0 = 0)

    - Obstacle ID: 30275
    - Relative Direction: Front-right
    - Distance Risk Reason: DTClong is 15.99m and DTClat is -11.80m, signifying negligible risk due to the large distances.
    - Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 5
    - Lateral Distance Safety Score: 5
    - Overall Distance Safety Score: 5.0 (5 * 0.5 + 5 * 0.5)
    - Time Risk Reason: TTClong is 710.85s and TTClat is inf, both indicating no risk.
    - Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 5
    - Lateral Time Safety Score: 5
    - Overall Time Safety Score: 5.0 (5 * 0.5 + 5 * 0.5)
    - Overall Risk Score: 5 (0.5 * 5 + 0.5 * 5 = 5)

    - Obstacle ID: 30276
    - Relative Direction: Front-right
    - Distance Risk Reason: DTClong is 13.89m and DTClat is -19.06m, both suggesting negligible risk.
