Here's the collision risk analysis:

**Obstacle 30294:**  This obstacle remains stationary throughout the scenario and is far from the ego vehicle's trajectory. *Risk Score: 5 (Negligible Risk)*

**Obstacle 30295:** This obstacle is moving slowly initially but accelerates over the scenario.  Its y-coordinate remains similar to the ego vehicle's, increasing the risk over time. However, the x-coordinate suggests a possible lane change of this obstacle away from the ego vehicle, lessening the immediate risk. More future information is needed to assess with certainty. For now, we consider it a potential risk.  *Risk Score: 3 (Medium Risk)*

**Obstacle 30298:** Stationary and far from the ego vehicle. *Risk Score: 5 (Negligible Risk)*

**Obstacle 30299:**  This obstacle is very close to the ego vehicle and moving slowly. While there's no immediate collision, the proximity and continued movement represent a potential danger. *Risk Score: 3 (Medium Risk)*

**Obstacle 30303:** Moving relatively fast and away from the ego vehicle. *Risk Score: 5 (Negligible Risk)*

**Obstacle 30305:** Located in the same lane as the ego vehicle and moving somewhat slower.  The distance between them is decreasing, indicating a risk if the ego vehicle decelerates or the obstacle accelerates.  *Risk Score: 2 (High Risk)*

**Obstacle 30306:**  Moving faster than ego vehicle and initially farther behind it, its y values suggest it will remain mostly behind the ego vehicle so although same lane its getting further away with time. *Risk Score: 4 (Low Risk)*
