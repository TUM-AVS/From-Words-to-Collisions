Obstacle 30294:  Stationary and far from the ego vehicle, posing no risk. Risk score: 5

Obstacle 30295: Initially somewhat distant, but its velocity is increasing while moving closer to the ego vehicle's lanelet.  The change in its lanelet ID to 761 suggests a lane change or some non-standard behavior. This warrants monitoring, but it's not an immediate threat over the predicted horizon. Risk score: 3

Obstacle 30298: Stationary and far from the ego vehicle, posing no risk. Risk score: 5

Obstacle 30299:  Slow-moving and nearly stationary, and located in a different lanelet. Poses no risk. Risk score: 5

Obstacle 30303:  Moving quickly in a different lanelet, and its trajectory doesn't appear to intersect with the ego vehicle's path in the near future. Risk score: 4

Obstacle 30305: In the same lanelet as the ego vehicle and moving slower than the ego vehicle. The distance is closing, but the ego vehicle is decelerating faster than this obstacle, hence no immediate collision risk. Risk Score: 4


Obstacle 30306: Although in a different lanelet initially, this obstacle is moving fast and its y-position is converging towards the ego vehicle's y-position. Requires continued observation. Risk Score: 3
