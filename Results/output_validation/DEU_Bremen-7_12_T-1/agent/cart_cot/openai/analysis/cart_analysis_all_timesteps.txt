To analyze the scenario, we'll focus on the most recent timestep, which is at 6.6 seconds. We will consider the position, velocity, and acceleration of the ego vehicle and surrounding obstacles to determine the risk level.

### Analysis:

1. **Ego Vehicle (30304.0):**
   - At position `(104.1273, 309.5623)`, velocity: `0.5813`, acceleration: `-0.3318`.
   - The vehicle is decelerating over time, indicating potential deceleration to avoid possible collisions.

2. **Obstacle 30295.0:**
   - At position `(129.5935, 311.5888)`, velocity: `2.2213`, accelerating. 
   - This vehicle is accelerating and moving away from the ego in terms of lanelet numbers, indicating decreasing risk.

3. **Obstacle 30305.0:** (Located in the same lanelet as the Ego)
   - At position `(93.1043, 316.2207)`, velocity: `1.9281`, and quickly decelerating.
   - This vehicle is in the same lanelet and showing decreasing speed, moving in the opposite direction compared to Ego, suggesting decrement in immediate collision risk.

4. **Obstacle 30306.0:**
   - At position `(82.4017, 322.1072)`, velocity: `3.7620` and decelerating.
   - Positioned further from Ego's coordinates, with minimal risk of immediate collision as they are on different course paths.
   
Given the data, none of the obstacles present a high or extreme risk of immediate collision with the ego vehicle. There are no indicators of impending collision within the assessed timeframe. The obstacles are either on different trajectories or moving away, significantly reducing imminent collision risk.

### JSON Output:
```json
{
    "CollisionObstacles": [],
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {},
    "HighRiskObstacle": {}
}
```

### Additional Notes:
- No obstacles are coded as extreme (1) or collision risks (0) due to calculated trajectories, velocities, accelerations, and lanelet positions. The scenario presents low to negligible risks with adequate vehicle responses implied in the metric trends.
