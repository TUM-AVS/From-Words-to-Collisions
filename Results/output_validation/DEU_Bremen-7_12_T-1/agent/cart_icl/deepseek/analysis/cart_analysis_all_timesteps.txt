        "Explanation": "Obstacle 30299.0 is in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle and is moving slowly towards it. The distance between them is decreasing, and the TTC is low, indicating a high risk of collision if no action is taken."

        "Explanation": "Obstacle 30305.0 is in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle and is moving towards it. Although the distance is greater than with obstacle 30299.0, the velocity and acceleration suggest a potential risk if trajectories remain unchanged."
