Obstacle 30295 is showing a concerning trend. While not immediately colliding, its lateral movement across timesteps suggests a potential lane change into the ego vehicle's path. Its relatively high velocity and acceleration compared to the ego vehicle warrant close monitoring and a high risk assessment. If this trend continues into the next few timesteps without intervention, a collision may be unavoidable.

Obstacle 30305 is in the same lane as the ego vehicle and its distance is decreasing, however the rate is low and there are no immediate concerns.
