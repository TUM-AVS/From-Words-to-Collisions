To analyze the risk levels of the given scenario, I will focus on each obstacle's trajectory and movements relative to the ego vehicle over the most recent time frame provided (at 6.6 seconds).

### Analysis of Key Obstacles

1. **Obstacle 30294**
   - Position: (133.2086, 310.8582)
   - Velocity: 0.0 (stationary)
   - The stationary nature and the distinct lanelet (1843) imply there is no immediate collision risk for the ego vehicle.
   - TTC is not applicable since the obstacle isn't moving, and the ego vehicle is not on a collision path.

2. **Obstacle 30295**
   - Position: (129.5935, 311.5888)
   - Velocity: 2.2213 m/s (closing on Ego)
   - This obstacle is moving towards Ego's position, but from a different lanelet (761). The relative longitudinal distance remains somewhat constant with lateral distance not indicating crossing paths directly.
   - Risk Level: **Low Risk (4)** as the velocity change and position suggest manageable conditions and no immediate threat.

3. **Obstacle 30298**
   - Position: (114.5512, 302.9051)
   - Velocity: 0.0 (stationary)
   - This stationary object has no immediate pathway or velocity implying any collision threat.
   - Risk Level: **Negligible Risk (5)**

4. **Obstacle 30299**
   - Position: (108.1986, 306.9704)
   - Velocity: 0.0429 m/s (near static)
   - Located in a lanelet different from ego's (915), suggesting no immediate interaction.
   - Risk Level: **Negligible Risk (5)**

5. **Obstacle 30305**
   - Position: (93.1043, 316.2207)
   - Velocity: 1.9281 m/s (moving away long term)
   - Same lanelet (912) as the ego yet the velocity is decreasing with position suggesting it is moving away or maintaining a safe distance.
   - Risk Level: **Medium Risk (3)** if the velocity and orientation synchronize into the same direction, but not immediate collision observed.

6. **Obstacle 30306**
   - Position: (82.4017, 322.1072)
   - Velocity: 3.762 m/s (moving at a moderate pace)
   - Located in a different lanelet (1698) with no converging paths evident.
   - Risk Level: **Low Risk (4)**

### Summary:
There are no indications of collision or extremely high risk. The data suggests most motions are perpendicular or parallel at safe distances with the latest timestep, requiring medium or low response levels for management.
