At time 6.6 seconds, Obstacle 30299 poses an extreme risk of collision with an MDC of 0.32 meters, demanding immediate action.  Obstacle 30299 is very close to the ego vehicle and moving towards it. Although it's difficult to determine an exact TTC with only position and velocity information, the proximity and closing velocity strongly suggest a TTC of less than 0.5 seconds, representing an extreme risk.

Obstacle 30295 shows a medium risk with an MDC of approximately 13.63 meters (calculated by sqrt(16.01^2 + 13.61^2) ). This distance doesnâ€™t represent an immediate threat, and there seems to be space for maneuvering. However, the lateral movement of this obstacle towards the ego vehicle necessitates close monitoring and a moderate risk assessment.

Other obstacles are far from the ego vehicle, thus having negligible risk.
