### Safety analysis for timestep 6.6 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

**Assumptions and Calculations:**

* To calculate TTC (Time-to-Collision), we'll use the following simplified formula: TTC = Distance / Relative Velocity.  If the relative velocity is zero or moving away from the ego vehicle, TTC is considered infinity (no collision risk). For lateral TTC calculation, the distance used will be the lateral distance. For longitudinal TTC calculation, the distance used will be the longitudinal distance.
* MDC (Minimum Distance to Collision) will be approximated by the current distance in this simplified analysis, as more sophisticated trajectory prediction is not possible with the provided data.
* Since accurate vehicle dimensions aren't provided, I'll assume a safety buffer/margin of 0.5 meters for both longitudinal and lateral directions. This means the effective distance used for risk assessment is reduced by this buffer.  This adjusted distance will be used for calculating proximity risk. For example, If an obstacle is 1 meter ahead but approaching at high speed, the adjusted longitudinal distance would be 1 - 0.5 = 0.5 meters, increasing the risk level.

**Adjusted Distance Calculation:**
`adjusted_d_long` = |`DTClong`| - 0.5
`adjusted_d_lat` = |`DTClat`| - 0.5

### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 30294**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is far away in the front-left.  `adjusted_d_long` = 18.97m, `adjusted_d_lat` = 18.97m
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason:  Relative longitudinal velocity is negative (approaching), but very slow. TTClong = 19.47m/0.58m/s ≈ 33.57 seconds. Relative lateral velocity is 0. TTClat = infinity.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 30295**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is relatively far in the front-left, but lateral distance is smaller. `adjusted_d_long` = 15.51m, `adjusted_d_lat` = 15.51m.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Relative longitudinal velocity is negative (approaching), but slow. TTClong = 16.01m / 0.48m/s ≈ 33.35 seconds. Relative lateral velocity is negative (approaching). TTClat = 16.01m / 2.22m/s ≈ 7.21 seconds.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 30298**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is in front and relatively close. `adjusted_d_long` = 7.36m, `adjusted_d_lat` = 7.36m.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Relative longitudinal velocity is negative and slow. TTClong = 7.86m / 0.58m/s ≈ 13.55 seconds.  TTClat = infinity.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 30299**
- Distance Risk reason: Extremely close in front. `adjusted_d_long` = 0.32 - 0.5 = -0.18m which translates into a collision if no action is taken. `adjusted_d_lat` = -0.18m. The safety buffer/margin of 0.5 meters should be taken into account here for better evaluation. 
- Distance safety score: 0
- Time Risk reason: Very low relative longitudinal velocity and it is negative (approaching). TTClong = 0.32m / 0.54m/s ≈ 0.59 seconds. TTClat = infinity.
- Time safety score: 1
- Overall Risk score: 0

- **Obstacle ID: 30305**
- Distance Risk reason:  Behind the ego vehicle, but relatively close. `adjusted_d_long` = 7.87m, `adjusted_d_lat` = 7.87m
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Positive relative longitudinal velocity(approaching from behind) and it is relatively slow. TTClong = 8.37m / 1.34m/s ≈ 6.25 seconds. Relatively small positive relative lateral velocity (approaching from the side and behind). TTClat = 8.37m / 0.09m/s ≈ 93 seconds. 
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 4


- **Obstacle ID: 30306**
- Distance Risk reason: Far behind the ego vehicle. `adjusted_d_long` = 20.06m, `adjusted_d_lat` = 20.06m
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Positive relative longitudinal velocity (approaching from behind), but it is not that slow. TTClong = 20.56m / 3.17m/s ≈ 6.49 seconds.  Small positive lateral velocity (approaching from the side and behind). TTClat = 20.56m / 0.32m/s ≈ 64.25 seconds.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5
