Let me analyze each obstacle at the most recent timestep (6.6 seconds) and assess collision risks:

1. Obstacle 30294 (Front-left):
   - Adjusted distances: longitudinal 19.47m, lateral 14.90m
   - Relative velocities: -0.58m/s (long), -0.00m/s (lat)
   - Motion: Approaching longitudinally, no lateral movement
   - TTC (long): 19.47/0.58 = 33.57s (No Risk)
   - MDC: Lateral distance stable at ~14.9m (No Risk)
   - Overall Risk: 5 (Negligible)

2. Obstacle 30295 (Front-left):
   - Adjusted distances: longitudinal 16.01m, lateral 13.61m
   - Relative velocities: -0.48m/s (long), -2.22m/s (lat)
   - Motion: Approaching both longitudinally and laterally
   - TTC (lat): 13.61/2.22 = 6.13s (Low Risk)
   - MDC: Lateral distance decreasing rapidly (14.65m→13.61m in 0.9s)
   - Overall Risk: 4 (Low Risk due to large lateral distance)

3. Obstacle 30298 (Front):
   - Adjusted distances: longitudinal 7.86m, lateral 0.00m
   - Relative velocities: -0.58m/s (long), -0.00m/s (lat)
   - Motion: Approaching longitudinally, exact lateral alignment
   - TTC (long): 7.86/0.58 = 13.55s (No Risk)
   - MDC: Lateral alignment but safe longitudinal distance
   - Overall Risk: 5 (Negligible)

4. Obstacle 30299 (Front):
   - Adjusted distances: longitudinal 0.32m, lateral 0.00m
   - Relative velocities: -0.54m/s (long), -0.00m/s (lat)
   - Motion: Approaching longitudinally, exact lateral alignment
   - TTC (long): 0.32/0.54 = 0.59s (High Risk)
   - MDC: 0.32m (Extreme Risk)
   - The obstacle is dangerously close frontally with closing speed
   - Overall Risk: 1 (Extreme Risk)

5. Obstacle 30305 (Behind):
   - Adjusted distances: longitudinal -8.37m, lateral 0.00m
   - Relative velocities: 1.34m/s (long), 0.09m/s (lat)
   - Motion: Approaching from behind, exact lateral alignment
   - TTC (long): 8.37/1.34 = 6.25s (Low Risk)
   - MDC: Safe following distance
   - Overall Risk: 4 (Low Risk)

6. Obstacle 30306 (Behind):
   - Adjusted distances: longitudinal -20.56m, lateral 0.00m
   - Relative velocities: 3.17m/s (long), 0.32m/s (lat)
   - Motion: Approaching from behind, exact lateral alignment
   - TTC (long): 20.56/3.17 = 6.49s (Low Risk)
   - MDC: Very safe distance
   - Overall Risk: 5 (Negligible)

Trajectory Analysis:
- Obstacle 30299 shows consistent frontal approach with decreasing distance (1.36m→0.32m in 0.9s)
- All other obstacles maintain safe distances or are moving away
- No actual collision occurring yet, but 30299 is imminent
