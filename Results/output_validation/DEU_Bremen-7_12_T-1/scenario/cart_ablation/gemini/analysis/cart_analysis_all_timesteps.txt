At t=6.8s, Ego's position is (104.2257, 309.5009) and its velocity is 0.436.  Let's analyze the closest obstacles:

* **Obstacle 30305:** Position (93.4211, 316.043), velocity 1.727 in the same lanelet (912). This obstacle is behind the ego vehicle and moving slower, posing no immediate threat. Risk score: 4 (Low Risk)

* **Obstacle 30299:** Position (108.205, 306.9663), velocity 0.035.  While moderately close, it's moving very slowly and not directly towards Ego. Risk score: 3 (Medium Risk).

* **Obstacle 30298:** Position (114.5512, 302.9051), velocity 0.0.  Stationary and not an immediate concern. Risk score: 4 (Low Risk)

* **Obstacle 30295:** Position (129.3523, 311.1596), velocity 2.5963. This obstacle is further away and its trajectory indicates it's moving away from Ego.  Risk score: 3 (Medium Risk)

* **Obstacle 30294:** Position (133.2086, 310.8582), velocity 0.0. Stationary and not a threat. Risk Score: 5 (Negligible risk)

* **Obstacle 30306:** Position (83.0413, 321.7751), velocity 3.5073, although quite far and appears to be on a diverging trajectory.  Risk score: 4 (Low risk)

No obstacles pose a collision or extreme risk.
