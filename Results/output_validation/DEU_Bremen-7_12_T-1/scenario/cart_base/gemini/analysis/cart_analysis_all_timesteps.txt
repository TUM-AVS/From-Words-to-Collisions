At t=6.8s, Ego (30304.0) is at (104.2, 309.5) in lanelet 912.0.  Obstacle 30305.0 is also in lanelet 912.0 at (93.4, 316.0), moving at 1.7 m/s and decelerating. The y-coordinates suggest they are not perfectly aligned laterally, reducing collision risk somewhat.  However, the distance is closing and Obstacle 30305.0 is fairly close behind Ego. Obstacle 30299.0 at (108.2, 306.9) in lanelet 915.0 is very close to Ego, almost stopped and not a significant risk given Ego's trajectory.  Other obstacles are significantly further away or in different lanelets, posing less immediate concern. While a collision isn't imminent in the next instant, the closing distance with 30305.0, combined with Ego's deceleration, suggests high risk.
