### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. Ego vehicle is slowing down (velocity: 0.436, acceleration: -0.3847).
2. No obstacles are in immediate collision path (all distances are safe).
3. Obstacle 30303.0 is the most concerning due to high speed and converging path, but still at a safe distance.
4. All other obstacles are either static, moving away, or in different lanelets.
5. No collision or extreme risk scenarios detected.
