### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 30294.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is far from ego and laterally offset. No imminent risk observed in the provided trajectory.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Stationary obstacle. No time-based risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 30295.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is far and laterally offset from ego.  Trajectory shows it moving away.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Although accelerating, the lateral offset and direction mitigate time-based risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 30298.0
- Distance Risk reason: Laterally offset and sufficiently far from ego.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Stationary, posing no time-dependent risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 30299.0
- Distance Risk reason:  Laterally offset from ego, and maintaining distance.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Minimal velocity and decelerating, reducing time-based risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 30303.0  (Not present in the last timestep, no analysis performed)

- Obstacle ID: 30305.0
- Distance Risk reason: In the same lanelet and behind the ego vehicle, but with a safe following distance.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason:  Moving slower than ego, decreasing risk over time.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- Obstacle ID: 30306.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is laterally offset and in a different lanelet. Safe distance maintained.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Although moving faster than ego, the differing lanelets and lateral offset minimize risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5



### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
No obstacle poses an immediate collision risk.  All obstacles are either stationary, moving away from the ego vehicle, or maintaining a safe distance.  Therefore, this is not a collision scenario.
