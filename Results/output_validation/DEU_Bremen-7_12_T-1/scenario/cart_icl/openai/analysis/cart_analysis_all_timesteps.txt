### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 30294.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: This obstacle is static and considerably ahead of the ego vehicle with no signs of intention to move. It poses no immediate threat.
  - Distance safety score: 5
  - Time Risk reason: There is no relative velocity as the obstacle is stationary. This leads to infinite TTC, hence no time-based risk.
  - Time safety score: 5
  - Overall Risk score: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 30295.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: Positioned in a different lanelet, this obstacle has been observed moving away over time, reducing any distance risk.
  - Distance safety score: 4
  - Time Risk reason: Its velocity is increasing, indicating it's moving away, lowering collision risk.
  - Time safety score: 4
  - Overall Risk score: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 30298.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: Static and positioned in a different lanelet, far behind the ego vehicle.
  - Distance safety score: 5
  - Time Risk reason: Since it's static, there's no time risk involved.
  - Time safety score: 5
  - Overall Risk score: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 30299.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: Moving very slowly and not directed towards the path of the ego vehicle with negligible velocity, posing no distance risk.
  - Distance safety score: 5
  - Time Risk reason: Its negligible velocity results in a high TTC.
  - Time safety score: 5
  - Overall Risk score: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 30303.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: High velocity but positioned in a separate trajectory and moving away; does not intersect the ego's path.
  - Distance safety score: 5
  - Time Risk reason: Its velocity away from the ego vehicle leads to infinite TTC.
  - Time safety score: 5
  - Overall Risk score: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 30305.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: In the same lane as the ego but maintaining a safe distance, moving slightly forward.
  - Distance safety score: 4
  - Time Risk reason: The velocity is decreasing, pointing to no immediate time-based risk.
  - Time safety score: 4
  - Overall Risk score: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 30306.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: Further distance and moving away from the ego vehicle trajectory, showing no collision path.
  - Distance safety score: 5
  - Time Risk reason: Its movement maintains a trajectory away from the ego, indicating no imminent threat.
  - Time safety score: 5
  - Overall Risk score: 5

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
The scenario does not indicate a collision at the most recent timestep. All obstacles are either stationary or moving out of the ego vehicle's projected path. No change in lane trajectory or acceleration trends suggest any contrary risk.
