Obstacle 30299 is at high risk of collision with the ego vehicle. It is only 0.21 meters in front of the ego vehicle and moving towards the ego vehicle at a speed of -0.40 m/s. Although the relative velocity is low, given its proximity (<1 meter), a collision is probable in the next timestep. This necessitates an immediate braking maneuver.
