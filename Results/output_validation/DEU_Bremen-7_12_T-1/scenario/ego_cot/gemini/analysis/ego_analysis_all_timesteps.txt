### Safety analysis for timestep 5.9s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 30294
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is 28.6m away diagonally (front-left).  No immediate risk.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: While approaching longitudinally (-1.38 m/s), the positive acceleration (0.99 m/sÂ²) suggests it might be slowing down/stopping. More information is needed to determine the real TTC.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- Obstacle ID: 30295
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is 23.7m away diagonally (front-left). No immediate risk.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Approaching both longitudinally and laterally, negative longitudinal acceleration worsens the risk. The combined motion poses a moderate risk.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3

- Obstacle ID: 30298
- Distance Risk reason: At 12.2m diagonally (front), this obstacle presents a moderate risk.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason:  Longitudinally approaching (-1.38 m/s), positive acceleration might indicate braking, but the proximity necessitates caution.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3

- Obstacle ID: 30299
- Distance Risk reason: Extremely close at 1.44m diagonally (front).  High risk of imminent collision.
- Distance safety score: 1
- Time Risk reason:  Approaching longitudinally (-1.30 m/s), even with positive acceleration, a collision is very likely.
- Time safety score: 1
- Overall Risk score: 1

- Obstacle ID: 30303
- Distance Risk reason:  Far away at 35.6m diagonally (front-right) and moving away.  No risk.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Moving away longitudinally and laterally. No collision risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 30305
- Distance Risk reason:  Moderately close at 13.1m diagonally (behind) and approaching.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: While approaching from behind, the relative velocity is low and poses a low risk currently.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 3

- Obstacle ID: 30306
- Distance Risk reason: Far away at 32.1m diagonally (behind) and slowly approaching.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Approaching from behind, but the distance and moderate relative velocity suggest low risk.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4


### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
    "CollisionObstacle": null,
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "30299",
        "OverallRiskScore": "1"
    },
    "IsCollisionScenario": false,
    "Justification": "Obstacle 30299 poses an extreme risk due to its very close proximity (1.44m) and longitudinal closing velocity, indicating a very high likelihood of a collision unless immediate action is taken. While not a certain collision yet, it warrants the highest alert level."
}
```

**Note:**  The analysis for other timesteps would follow the same structure, recalculating TTC and MDC based on the updated position, velocity, and acceleration data.  A proper TTC calculation needs more sophisticated methods that consider the changing accelerations.  Here, a qualitative assessment is made based on the provided data trends.  It's crucial to remember that these simplified calculations provide estimates, and real-world autonomous driving systems employ more complex collision detection algorithms.
