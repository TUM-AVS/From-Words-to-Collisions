**Obstacle-by-Obstacle Analysis:**

1. **Obstacle 30294 (Front-left):**
   - **Position and Motion:** Adjusted longitudinal = 19.38 m, adjusted lateral = 14.86 m. It is moving slightly toward the ego vehicle.
   - **Relative Velocity:** Longitudinal = -0.44 m/s (approaching), Lateral = -0.00 m/s (no lateral motion).
   - **MDC and TTC:** 
     - MDC is significantly greater than 5 m in both dimensions.
     - TTC (longitudinal) = 19.38 m / 0.44 m/s = 44.05 s (No Risk as TTC > 5s).
   - **Risk Score:** 5 (No Risk).

2. **Obstacle 30295 (Front-left):**
   - **Position and Motion:** Adjusted longitudinal = 15.94 m, adjusted lateral = 13.08 m. Moving toward the ego.
   - **Relative Velocity:** Longitudinal = -0.32 m/s, Lateral = -2.59 m/s.
   - **MDC and TTC:** 
     - Longitudinal TTC = 15.94 m / 0.32 m/s = 49.81 s (No Risk).
     - Lateral is closing rapidly; however, not within critical distance.
   - **Risk Score:** 4 (Low Risk due to lateral closing).

3. **Obstacle 30298 (Front):**
   - **Position and Motion:** Adjusted longitudinal = 7.74 m, adjusted lateral = 0.00 m.
   - **Relative Velocity:** Longitudinal = -0.44 m/s.
   - **MDC and TTC:** 
     - Longitudinal TTC = 7.74 m / 0.44 m/s = 17.59 s (No Risk).
   - **Risk Score:** 5 (No Risk).

4. **Obstacle 30299 (Front):**
   - **Position and Motion:** Adjusted longitudinal = 0.21 m, adjusted lateral = 0.00 m.
   - **Relative Velocity:** Longitudinal = -0.40 m/s.
   - **MDC and TTC:** 
     - Directly in front and very close. Longitudinal TTC = 0.21 m / 0.40 m/s = 0.525 s.
     - MDC is extremely low (0.21 m).
   - **Risk Assessment:** Extreme Risk due to immediate proximity and TTC.
   - **Risk Score:** 1 (Extreme Risk).

5. **Obstacle 30305 (Behind):**
   - **Position and Motion:** Adjusted longitudinal = -8.12 m.
   - **Relative Velocity:** Longitudinal = 1.29 m/s (approaching from behind).
   - **MDC and TTC:** 
     - Longitudinal TTC is not applicable as it's behind with closing trajectory but not immediate.
   - **Risk Score:** 4 (Low Risk due to long distance).

6. **Obstacle 30306 (Behind):**
   - **Position and Motion:** Adjusted longitudinal = -19.96 m.
   - **Relative Velocity:** Longitudinal = 3.06 m/s (approaching from behind).
   - **MDC and TTC:** 
     - Longitudinal TTC not immediate.
   - **Risk Score:** 5 (No Risk due to distance).

**Collision Scenario Analysis:**

- **Obstacle 30299** presents an **Extreme Risk** due to its very close proximity and converging longitudinal trajectory. No other obstacles pose immediate threat levels in this scenario, although obstacles from behind should be monitored.
