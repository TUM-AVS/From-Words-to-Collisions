### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 30294
- Relative Direction: Front-left
- Distance Risk Reason: Both longitudinal and lateral distances are large (19.38m and 14.86m respectively), indicating low risk. The trend over time suggests the longitudinal distance is slowly decreasing while lateral distance remains relatively constant.
- Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 5
- Lateral Distance Safety Score: 5
- Overall Distance Safety Score: 5.0  (5 * 0.5 + 5 * 0.5)
- Time Risk Reason: Longitudinal TTC is very high (44.44s) indicating negligible risk. Lateral TTC is infinite further confirming no lateral risk.  The longitudinal TTC has been increasing, suggesting the obstacle is decelerating or the ego vehicle is accelerating.
- Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 5
- Lateral Time Safety Score: 5
- Overall Time Safety Score: 5.0 (5 * 0.5 + 5 * 0.5)
- Overall Risk Score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 30295
- Relative Direction: Front-left
- Distance Risk Reason:  Longitudinal distance (15.94m) presents low risk, while lateral distance (13.08m) is also relatively safe.  The trend shows both distances decreasing, suggesting the obstacle is approaching the ego vehicle.
- Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 5
- Lateral Distance Safety Score: 5
- Overall Distance Safety Score: 5.0 (5 * 0.5 + 5 * 0.5)
- Time Risk Reason: Longitudinal TTC is very high (50.33s), and lateral TTC (5.04s) is now low, suggesting the lateral approach might require attention in the future even though current distance is significant.
- Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 5
- Lateral Time Safety Score: 4
- Overall Time Safety Score: 4.5 (5 * 0.5 + 4 * 0.5)
- Overall Risk Score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 30298
- Relative Direction: Front
- Distance Risk Reason: Longitudinal distance is 7.74m, which is low risk.  Lateral distance is 0m indicating the obstacle is directly ahead. The trend shows decreasing longitudinal distance.
- Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 4
- Lateral Distance Safety Score: 0 
- Overall Distance Safety Score: 4.0 (4 * 1.0 + 0 * 0.0)
- Time Risk Reason: Longitudinal TTC is 17.76s, indicating negligible risk for now. Lateral TTC is 0s which signals extreme high risk and should be monitored. The increasing longitudinal TTC and constant lateral TTC = 0 suggests that the obstacle is slightly decelerating or the ego is slightly accelerating while maintaining the exact lateral alignment.
- Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 5
- Lateral Time Safety Score: 0
- Overall Time Safety Score: 5.0 (5 * 1.0 + 0 * 0.0)
- Overall Risk Score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 30299
- Relative Direction: Front
- Distance Risk Reason: Longitudinal distance is extremely close (0.21m) presenting imminent collision risk.  Lateral distance is 0m.
- Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 1
- Lateral Distance Safety Score: 0
- Overall Distance Safety Score: 1.0 (1 * 1.0 + 0 * 0.0)
- Time Risk Reason: Longitudinal TTC is extremely low (0.52s), indicating extreme risk. Lateral TTC is 0s.  Both TTC values show consistent extreme risk.
- Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 1
- Lateral Time Safety Score: 0
- Overall Time Safety Score: 1.0 (1 * 1.0 + 0 * 0.0)
- Overall Risk Score: 1

- Obstacle ID: 30305
- Relative Direction: Behind
- Distance Risk Reason: Longitudinal distance is -8.12m, indicating the obstacle is behind the ego vehicle. Lateral distance is 0m. The trend shows decreasing longitudinal distance, meaning the obstacle is approaching from behind.
- Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 4
- Lateral Distance Safety Score: 0
- Overall Distance Safety Score: 4.0 (4 * 1.0 + 0 * 0.0)
- Time Risk Reason: Longitudinal TTC is 6.30s suggesting no immediate risk longitudinally. Lateral TTC is 0s and represents negligible lateral risk in this particular case, given the longitudinal motion of the vehicle.
- Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 5
- Lateral Time Safety Score: 0
- Overall Time Safety Score: 5.0 (5 * 1.0 + 0 * 0.0)
- Overall Risk Score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 30306
- Relative Direction: Behind
- Distance Risk Reason: Longitudinal distance is -19.96m, indicating the obstacle is far behind.  Lateral distance is 0m. The trend shows decreasing longitudinal distance.
- Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 5
- Lateral Distance Safety Score: 0
- Overall Distance Safety Score: 5.0 (5 * 1.0 + 0 * 0.0)
- Time Risk Reason: Longitudinal TTC is 6.52s, suggesting no immediate longitudinal risk.  Lateral TTC is 0s and does not present a lateral risk given the "Behind" relative direction and longitudinal motion description.
- Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 5
- Lateral Time Safety Score: 0
- Overall Time Safety Score: 5.0 (5 * 1.0 + 0 * 0.0)
- Overall Risk Score: 5
