Here's the collision risk analysis:

**Obstacle 30304:** This obstacle is located in a different lanelet (912) than the ego vehicle (1698), and their y-coordinates are significantly different and diverging.  The x-coordinates show that the obstacle is ahead of the ego vehicle. There is no immediate risk of collision. Risk score: 5.

**Obstacle 30306:** This obstacle is in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle at the beginning of the scenario (553). Though initially behind the ego vehicle, it is approaching rapidly with a higher velocity. However, the ego vehicle changes lanelets to 1698, thereby reducing the risk of collision significantly. Considering the relative velocities and lane change, the risk is evaluated as medium initially and then negligible. Risk Score: 3 initially, changing to 5.

**Obstacle 30307:**  This obstacle is initially located behind the ego vehicle in the same lanelet (553). Similar to Obstacle 30306, it has a higher velocity than the ego vehicle. However, the ego vehicle's lane change maneuver reduces the risk substantially. Risk Score: 3 initially, changing to 5.
