Obstacle 30304: This obstacle is in a different lanelet (912) than the ego vehicle (1698), and their y-coordinates are significantly different and diverging.  The x-coordinates are also far apart and increasing. This obstacle poses no risk. Risk score: 5

Obstacle 30306: This obstacle is in the same lanelet (553) as the ego vehicle was initially. However, the ego vehicle has transitioned to lanelet 1698. While obstacle 30306 is getting closer to the ego vehicle's initial position in lanelet 553, the ego vehicle is moving away, and they are in different lanelets.  The data doesn't provide enough information to determine the exact relationship between lanelets 553 and 1698 (e.g., parallel lanes, merging lanes), but the overall trend suggests decreasing risk. Risk score: 4

Obstacle 30307: This obstacle is in lanelet 553, while the ego vehicle has transitioned to lanelet 1698.  Similar to obstacle 30306, further information on lanelet geometry is needed. However, obstacle 30307 is also behind the ego vehicle's initial position and the ego vehicle is moving away. Risk score: 4
