Obstacle 30306 is showing a concerning trend. While not immediately colliding, its lanelet (553) matches the ego vehicle's past lanelet, and the distance is decreasing over subsequent timesteps.  Obstacle 30307, also in lanelet 553, is further away but moving faster than 30306. It needs continued monitoring. Obstacle 30304 maintains a safe lateral separation in a different lanelet.
