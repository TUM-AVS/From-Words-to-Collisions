### Brief Analysis

At the most recent timestep (4.7 seconds), the Ego car is at position (78.6921, 323.9583), moving with a velocity of 3.4814. Here's the risk assessment for each obstacle:

1. **Obstacle 30304.0**: 
   - Position: (99.5169, 312.3995)
   - Velocity: 2.2162
   - The obstacle is decelerating and moving away from the trajectory of the Ego vehicle. The lateral displacement and reduction in speed indicate there is no collision risk in the immediate paths. Hence, the risk level is low.

2. **Obstacle 30306.0**: 
   - Position: (74.0097, 326.1457)
   - Velocity: 6.3537
   - This obstacle is on a trajectory that intersects the Ego's path more closely, given it's in the same lanelet in earlier steps. The decreasing speed and position towards the lane center suggest a manageable situation, but care must be taken.

3. **Obstacle 30307.0**:
   - Position: (58.917, 332.81)
   - Velocity: 7.4305
   - This obstacle is in the same lanelet as the Ego initially was, but significantly trailing behind. It is moving faster, but still at a safe distance. The risk remains moderate.

After evaluating the positions, velocities, and decelerating patterns, none of the obstacles pose an immediate or extreme risk of collision with the Ego vehicle.
