### Analysis:

1. **Obstacle 30306 (Same Lanelet 553.0 as Ego at 3.8s, later diverges):**
   - **Position Trend**: Starts at (68.2931, 328.6816) and moves to (74.0097, 326.1457) over 10 timesteps.
   - **Velocity**: High initial velocity (7.6658 m/s) but decelerating to 6.3537 m/s.
   - **Relative Motion**: Moving in the same direction as ego but decelerating faster. Lateral distance is decreasing but remains significant.
   - **TTC**: Not imminent due to lateral separation and deceleration.
   - **Risk**: **Medium (3)** - Manageable with driver/system response.

2. **Obstacle 30307 (Same Lanelet 553.0 as Ego at 3.8s, later diverges):**
   - **Position Trend**: Starts at (52.3691, 335.6009) and moves to (58.9170, 332.8100).
   - **Velocity**: High initial velocity (8.4792 m/s) but decelerating to 7.4305 m/s.
   - **Relative Motion**: Moving in the same direction as ego but decelerating. Lateral distance is decreasing but remains significant.
   - **TTC**: Not imminent due to lateral separation and deceleration.
   - **Risk**: **Medium (3)** - Manageable with driver/system response.

3. **Obstacle 30304 (Lanelet 912.0, adjacent to ego's lane):**
   - **Position Trend**: Starts at (97.2612, 313.7731) and moves to (99.5169, 312.3995).
   - **Velocity**: Decelerating from 3.8294 m/s to 2.2162 m/s.
   - **Relative Motion**: Moving away from ego's path, significant lateral separation.
   - **TTC**: Not applicable due to lateral separation.
   - **Risk**: **Low (4)** - No immediate danger.

### Highest Risk Obstacle:
- **Obstacle 30306** has the highest risk due to its proximity and same-lanelet trajectory, but the risk is manageable (**Medium Risk (3)**).
