Obstacle 30306 is in the same lane as the ego vehicle and is relatively close.  Over the past few timesteps, its velocity has been consistently higher than the ego's, but it's also decelerating. Further analysis is needed to determine the risk of collision, but it's potentially high.

Obstacle 30307 is also in the same lane as the ego vehicle and even closer than 30306 at the latest timestep. It is also traveling at a higher velocity than the ego vehicle, though it's decelerating. It presents a higher risk than 30306 due to its proximity and higher velocity.

Obstacle 30304 is in a different lane and poses no immediate threat.

At timestep 4.7s:
* **Ego:** (78.6921, 323.9583), velocity 3.4814 m/s
* **Obstacle 30306:** (74.0097, 326.1457), velocity 6.3537 m/s
* **Obstacle 30307:** (58.917, 332.81), velocity 7.4305 m/s


Approximate TTC and MDC calculations (using latest available data):

**Obstacle 30306:**
* Longitudinal distance: 74.0097 - 78.6921 = -4.6824 m (behind ego)
* Lateral distance:  326.1457 - 323.9583 = 2.1874 m
* Relative longitudinal velocity: 6.3537 - 3.4814 = 2.8723 m/s (closing in)
* TTC:  4.6824 / 2.8723 ≈ 1.63 seconds

**Obstacle 30307:**
* Longitudinal distance: 58.917 - 78.6921 = -19.7751 m (behind ego)
* Lateral distance: 332.81 - 323.9583 = 8.8517 m
* Relative longitudinal velocity: 7.4305 - 3.4814 = 3.9491 m/s (closing in)
* TTC: 19.7751 / 3.9491 ≈ 5.00 seconds (overtaking)


Risk Assessment:

* **Obstacle 30306:** Although behind the ego vehicle and with some lateral distance, its rapid approach suggests a high risk of collision, especially if lane changes are not considered. Risk: **High (2)**
* **Obstacle 30307:**  Although behind and further than 30306 at this timestep, the relatively high closing speed warrants attention. Risk: **Medium (3)**
* **Obstacle 30304:** No immediate risk due to different lane and sufficient distance. Risk: **Low (4)**
