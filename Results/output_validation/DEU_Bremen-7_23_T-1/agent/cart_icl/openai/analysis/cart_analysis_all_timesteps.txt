To assess the risk levels, we'll primarily focus on the most recent timestamp at **4.7 seconds**, while considering the trajectory trends from preceding data.

### Analysis at 4.7 Seconds

**Ego Vehicle (ID: 30305.0):**
- Position: (78.6921, 323.9583)
- Velocity: 3.4814 m/s
- Lanelet: 1698.0

**Obstacle 30304.0:**
- Position: (99.5169, 312.3995)
- Velocity: 2.2162 m/s
- Lanelet: 912.0
- The obstacle is in a different lanelet and further coordinates show it's trailing off. 
- Risk Evaluation: **Negligible Risk (5)**

**Obstacle 30306.0:**
- Position: (74.0097, 326.1457)
- Velocity: 6.3537 m/s
- Lanelet: 553.0
- This obstacle is in the same lanelet as some earlier timestamps, suggesting possible lane merging scenarios earlier. The relative position is approximately 4.7 meters lateral, meaning it poses no immediate threat of collision.
- Risk Evaluation: **Low Risk (4)**

**Obstacle 30307.0:**
- Position: (58.917, 332.81)
- Velocity: 7.4305 m/s
- Lanelet: 553.0
- While it travels in the same lane and is aligning closer laterally, the relative position and speed differences show no immediate collision threat. It's outside the direct path of the ego vehicle.
- Risk Evaluation: **Medium Risk (3)**

### Conclusion:

After reviewing both position changes and trend in velocities, no obstacles were found to meet the criteria for extreme or collision risks.

### Structured JSON Output:

```json
{
    "CollisionObstacles": [],
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": null,
        "OverallRiskScore": null
    },
    "HighRiskObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": null,
        "OverallRiskScore": null
    }
}
```

This structured JSON indicates that currently, there are no obstacles posing an immediate or extreme risk to the ego vehicle. The scenario remains manageable given an attentive control system.
