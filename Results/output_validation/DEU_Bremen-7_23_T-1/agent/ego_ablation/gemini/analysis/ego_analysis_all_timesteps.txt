At t=4.7 seconds, Obstacle 30306 is behind the ego vehicle at a longitudinal distance of -0.66 meters. This close proximity signifies a very high risk of collision.  Given the closing velocity, a collision is imminent within the next time step if the trajectory remains the same.

Obstacle 30304, at a distance of 19.27 meters in front, poses no immediate threat. Obstacle 30307, behind the ego vehicle at -17.15 meters, also has ample separation and is not an immediate concern.

Focusing on the most critical obstacle, 30306, the MDC is approximately 0.66 meters, falling within the Extreme Risk category (score 1).  Although the specific TTC isn't directly calculable from the given data, the rapidly closing distance and relative velocity strongly suggest a TTC of less than 0.5 seconds, further reinforcing the Extreme Risk assessment.
