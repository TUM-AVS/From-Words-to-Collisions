### Safety analysis for timestep 4.7s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

**Assumptions and Clarifications:**

* Since adjusted distances (adjusted_d_long, adjusted_d_lat) are not provided, I will use the provided real distances (DTClong, DTClat) for the analysis.  However, I strongly recommend using adjusted distances in a real-world application for more accurate safety assessments.
* I'm inferring TTC based on the provided velocity and distance information. A more precise TTC calculation requires accurate trajectory predictions.
* Lateral movement analysis assumes the ego vehicle maintains its current course. 

### Obstacle Analysis:

**- Obstacle ID: 30304**
- Distance Risk reason:  Located at 19.27m longitudinally and 19.27m laterally in front of the ego vehicle.  This poses no immediate proximity risk.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Though moving slightly towards the ego vehicle longitudinally, the large distance and relatively slow speed suggest ample time to react.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

**- Obstacle ID: 30306**
- Distance Risk reason: Located very close behind the ego vehicle at -0.66m longitudinally and -0.66m laterally. This indicates an extremely high risk of collision.
- Distance safety score: 1
- Time Risk reason: Closing rapidly on the ego vehicle from behind. The small distance and relatively high closing speed suggest a very short time to collision.
- Time safety score: 1
- Overall Risk score: 1

**- Obstacle ID: 30307**
- Distance Risk reason: Located at -17.15m longitudinally and -17.15m laterally behind the ego vehicle. This provides a safe distance currently.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: While approaching the ego vehicle from behind, there's still a reasonable distance and time to react if the current trajectories are maintained.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4
