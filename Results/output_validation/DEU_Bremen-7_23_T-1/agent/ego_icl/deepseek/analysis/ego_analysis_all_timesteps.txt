Let me analyze each obstacle at the most recent timestep (4.7 seconds) and assess collision risk:

**Obstacle 30304 (Front):**
- Longitudinal distance: 19.27m (closing at -1.28m/s)
- Lateral distance: 0.00m (closing at -0.22m/s)
- TTC (longitudinal): 19.27/1.28 = 15.05s (No Risk)
- TTC (lateral): 0.00/0.22 = 0s (but lateral distance stable)
- MDC: Lateral distance is 0.00m but not closing significantly
- Risk: 5 (Negligible) - Large longitudinal distance despite alignment

**Obstacle 30306 (Behind):**
- Longitudinal distance: -0.66m (closing at 2.87m/s)
- Lateral distance: 0.00m (closing at 0.21m/s)
- TTC (longitudinal): 0.66/2.87 = 0.23s (Extreme Risk)
- MDC: 0.66m longitudinal (High Risk)
- Risk: 1 (Extreme) - Very close with high closing speed from behind

**Obstacle 30307 (Behind):**
- Longitudinal distance: -17.15m (closing at 3.94m/s)
- Lateral distance: 0.00m (closing at 0.34m/s)
- TTC (longitudinal): 17.15/3.94 = 4.35s (Low Risk)
- MDC: 17.15m longitudinal (No Risk)
- Risk: 4 (Low) - Significant distance despite closing speed

**Trajectory Analysis:**
- 30306 is rapidly approaching from behind with decreasing distance (-3.65m → -0.66m in 0.9s)
- 30306's relative velocity is increasing (3.94 → 2.87 m/s)
- At current rate, will reach collision (0m) in ~0.23s
- Both other obstacles pose minimal immediate risk

**JSON Summary:**

```json
{
    "CollisionObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "None",
        "OverallRiskScore": "5"
    },
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "30306",
        "OverallRiskScore": "1"
    },
    "PredictedCollisionObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "30306",
        "OverallRiskScore": "0"
    }
}
```

**Key Findings:**
- Obstacle 30306 presents extreme risk (score 1) and is predicted to collide within 0.23s if trajectories continue
- Immediate evasive action required to prevent rear-end collision
- Other obstacles currently pose minimal risk
