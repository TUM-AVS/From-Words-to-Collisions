Obstacle 30304: Located in front of the ego vehicle.  The longitudinal distance is consistently large (around 19m) and although it is decreasing slightly over time, the relative velocity is very small and indicates that the obstacle is slowly approaching the ego vehicle.  Lateral distance is 0.00m, suggesting exact same-lane alignment, but with the large longitudinal separation, this doesn't represent an immediate risk. With a longitudinal relative velocity of -1.28 m/s (moving towards each other) at 4.7s, and a distance of 19.27m, TTC is 19.27/1.28 ≈ 15.05 seconds.  MDC is also large, > 5m. Risk level: 5 (Negligible Risk).

Obstacle 30306: Located behind the ego vehicle.  Longitudinal distance is -0.66m (behind) and the obstacle has a positive relative velocity of 2.87m/s, quickly closing in on the ego vehicle.  This closing distance and velocity represent an extremely high risk scenario. TTC is 0.66 / 2.87 ≈ 0.23 seconds.  MDC is 0.66m. Both TTC and MDC indicate Extreme Risk (1).

Obstacle 30307:  Located behind the ego vehicle. Longitudinal distance is much larger than 30306, at -17.15m, but it shows a consistent positive relative velocity (4.35 m/s at t=4.2s, for example), indicating it is approaching the ego vehicle. TTC at 4.7s is 17.15/3.94 ≈ 4.35 seconds. MDC is > 5m. Risk level: 4 (Low Risk).

Because Obstacle 30306 has a TTC of less than 0.5 seconds and an MDC less than 1.0m, while rapidly approaching the ego vehicle, it poses the most significant risk.
