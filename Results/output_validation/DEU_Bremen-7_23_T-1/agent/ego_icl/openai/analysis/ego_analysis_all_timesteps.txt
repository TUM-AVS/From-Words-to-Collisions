To analyze the collision risk for the ego vehicle, let's examine each obstacle from the most recent timestep (4.7 seconds) while considering the obstacle's trajectory from previous steps. We'll calculate Time-to-Collision (TTC) and Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC) using adjusted distances and evaluate risk levels accordingly.

### Obstacle Analyses

#### Obstacle 30304
- **Position:** Front of the ego vehicle
- **Adjusted Longitudinal Distance:** 19.27 m
- **Adjusted Lateral Distance:** 0.00 m
- **Relative Velocity:** Longitudinal: -1.28 m/s, Lateral: -0.22 m/s
- **Motion:** Driving toward the ego longitudinally, exact lateral alignment
- **Trajectory Evaluation:** The obstacle is consistently moving toward the ego car longitudinally over time intervals.
  
**Calculations:**
- As the lateral distance is 0.00 m, we focus on longitudinal dynamics.
- **TTC (Longitudinal):** \( \frac{19.27}{1.28} \approx 15.06 \) seconds
- **MDC (Longitudinal):** As lateral alignment isn't leading to collision, focus on longitudinal trajectory. Minimum distance remains around 19.27m in immediate future.

**Risk Assessment:**
- The large longitudinal distance combined with significant TTC indicates a **Negligible Risk (Score 5)**.

#### Obstacle 30306
- **Position:** Behind the ego vehicle
- **Adjusted Longitudinal Distance:** -0.66 m
- **Adjusted Lateral Distance:** 0.00 m
- **Relative Velocity:** Longitudinal: 2.87 m/s, Lateral: 0.21 m/s
- **Motion:** Driving toward the ego from behind, exact lateral alignment
- **Trajectory Evaluation:** The obstacle is closing in rapidly with decreasing longitudinal distance and increasing velocity towards the ego vehicle.

**Calculations:**
- As the lateral distance is 0.00 m, focus remains on longitudinal dynamics.
- **TTC (Longitudinal):** \( \frac{0.66}{2.87} \approx 0.23 \) seconds
- **MDC (Longitudinal):** Approaching 0 m given closing longitudinal trajectory.

**Risk Assessment:**
- With a very low TTC and decreasing distance, there's an **Extreme Risk (Score 1)**.

#### Obstacle 30307
- **Position:** Behind the ego vehicle
- **Adjusted Longitudinal Distance:** -17.15 m
- **Adjusted Lateral Distance:** 0.00 m
- **Relative Velocity:** Longitudinal: 3.94 m/s, Lateral: 0.34 m/s
- **Motion:** Driving toward the ego vehicle, exact lateral alignment.
- **Trajectory Evaluation:** Consistently approaching the ego vehicle longitudinally over past intervals.

**Calculations:**
- Focus on longitudinal dynamics as lateral distance is 0.00 m.
- **TTC (Longitudinal):** \( \frac{17.15}{3.94} \approx 4.35 \) seconds
- **MDC:** Remains greater than approaching threshold over time, showing diverging paths on immediate projections.

**Risk Assessment:**
- Relative TTC indicates a **Low Risk (Score 4)** due to sufficient time and lesser immediate closing speed.

### Final Assessment and JSON Summary

Across obstacles analyzed, 30306 poses an extreme risk due to immediate rear approach and closing trajectory. Obstacle 30304 and 30307 do not pose significant immediate risks.

```json
{
  "CollisionObstacle": {
    "ObstacleID": "30306",
    "OverallRiskScore": "0"
  },
  "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {
    "ObstacleID": "30306",
    "OverallRiskScore": "1"
  },
  "HighRiskObstacle": {
    "ObstacleID": null,
    "OverallRiskScore": null
  }
}
```

This analysis highlights obstacle 30306 as the primary source of concern, potentially leading to a collision if no actions are taken.
