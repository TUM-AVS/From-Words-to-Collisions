At t=4.9s, Ego (30305.0) is at (79.3185, 323.6528) in lanelet 1698.0.

Obstacle 30304.0 is at (99.8685, 312.1844) in lanelet 912.0.  While the x-coordinate difference is significant, the y-coordinate difference is only about 11.5.  Given the trajectory history, this obstacle seems to be decelerating rapidly but is likely in a different lanelet, suggesting medium to low risk, not extreme.

Obstacle 30306.0 is at (75.1345, 325.642) in lanelet 553.0. The x-coordinate difference is now just over 4 and the y-coordinate difference under 2. This obstacle is rapidly approaching the ego vehicle. Coupled with the history showing decreasing velocities for both, a collision is highly possible in the next few timesteps. This represents an extreme risk.

Obstacle 30307.0 is at (60.2516, 332.2311) in lanelet 553.0.  While this obstacle is in the same lanelet as 30306.0 and moving towards ego, it's considerably further away and poses less immediate risk than 30306.0.
