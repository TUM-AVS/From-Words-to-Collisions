### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 30304
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is laterally separated and moving away from ego.  History shows divergence.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason:  Relative velocity and acceleration show no risk. History confirms this trend.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 30306
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is behind ego, but in the same lanelet. History shows some longitudinal convergence.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Obstacle is moving faster than ego, but decelerating. History shows decreasing relative velocity.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- Obstacle ID: 30307
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is further behind than 30306 and also in the same lanelet.  History shows some longitudinal convergence.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Obstacle is moving faster than ego, but decelerating. History shows decreasing relative velocity.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4


### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
No obstacle poses an immediate collision risk. Obstacles 30306 and 30307 are behind the ego vehicle and traveling faster, but they are decelerating. The historical data shows that the relative velocities are decreasing. Obstacle 30304 is in a different lane and moving away. This is not a collision scenario.
