### Obstacle Analysis:

#### Obstacle ID: 30304
- **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle ID 30304 is positioned significantly ahead of the ego vehicle and in a different lanelet (912 vs. 1698), and has been constantly decelerating based on several timesteps, indicating it is moving further from the ego vehicle.
- **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- **Time Risk reason**: The velocity and acceleration trend shows decreasing speed and a path that doesn't intersect with the ego vehicle's trajectory.
- **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- **Overall Risk score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)

#### Obstacle ID: 30306
- **Distance Risk reason**: Positioned behind and to the side of the ego vehicle, and is decelerating with a consistent trajectory in the lanelet 553, which does not intersect with the ego's lane.
- **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- **Time Risk reason**: Relative velocity implies diverging paths; therefore, minimal time risk given its consistent trailing course.
- **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- **Overall Risk score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)

#### Obstacle ID: 30307
- **Distance Risk reason**: Located further away from the ego vehicle, and the increasing separation over time suggests paths that do not converge.
- **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- **Time Risk reason**: Continuous deceleration and a clear history of decreasing speed indicate low potential for collision.
- **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- **Overall Risk score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
- There is no immediate risk of collision or close trajectory overlap between the ego vehicle and any of the obstacles based on their positions and paths during the last timeline.
- All obstacles are moving either away or are in different lanes than the ego vehicle.
- The consistent deceleration of obstacles indicates negligible risk.
