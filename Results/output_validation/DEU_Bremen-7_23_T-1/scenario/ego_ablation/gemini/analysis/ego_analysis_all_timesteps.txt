Obstacle 30306 is at high risk of collision with the ego vehicle. It is located behind the ego vehicle at a longitudinal distance of -0.12 meters, meaning it is extremely close and potentially overlapping with the ego vehicle's rear.  The relative velocity indicates that the obstacle is approaching the ego vehicle at 2.63 m/s. While relative acceleration suggests some deceleration, the proximity and current velocity pose a serious threat of imminent collision.
