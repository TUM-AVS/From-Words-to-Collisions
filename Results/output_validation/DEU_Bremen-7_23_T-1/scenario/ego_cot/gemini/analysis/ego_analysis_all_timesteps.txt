### Safety analysis for timestep 4.0-4.9: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

**Methodology:**

Given the constant negative relative longitudinal velocity and distance for Obstacle 30306, TTClong is calculated using the provided data. However, the lateral movement information isn't sufficient to determine TTClat precisely. Since the scenario mentions "Exact lateral alignment or unknown case," I assume a collision course laterally if DTClat continues to decrease at the observed rate.  A similar approach is used for MDC, considering both longitudinal and lateral components where applicable.

**Calculations and Reasoning:**

Obstacle 30304 consistently maintains a safe distance and shows no immediate risk of collision, although it is approaching the ego vehicle longitudinally. Obstacle 30307 also remains at a safe distance throughout the given timeframe. The primary concern is Obstacle 30306, which is rapidly approaching the ego vehicle from behind and exhibits a high risk of collision within the next second.

The formula used for TTClong is: `-DTClong / Vrel_long`. If `Vrel_long` is positive, TTClong is infinity, since the obstacle is moving away.

**### Obstacle Analysis:**

**- Obstacle ID: 30304**
- Distance Risk reason:  DTClong > 19m. No immediate risk.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason:  Obstacle is slowly approaching but no immediate collision risk within the provided timeframe.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

**- Obstacle ID: 30306**
- Distance Risk reason: DTClong is negative and decreasing rapidly. Extremely high risk of rear-end collision.
- Distance safety score: 1
- Time Risk reason: TTClong indicates imminent collision.
- Time safety score: 1
- Overall Risk score: 1

**- Obstacle ID: 30307**
- Distance Risk reason: DTClong is negative but relatively large. Low risk.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason:  Obstacle is approaching but the timeframe suggests no immediate collision.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4
