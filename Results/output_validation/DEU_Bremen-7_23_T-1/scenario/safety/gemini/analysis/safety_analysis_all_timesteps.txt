### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
    - Obstacle ID: 30304
    - Relative Direction: Front
    - Distance Risk Reason: DTClong is 18.99m, which is > 5, indicating negligible risk longitudinally. DTClat is 0.00m, indicating a collision risk laterally, though the obstacle and ego vehicle appear to be perfectly aligned. The DTClong has been consistently decreasing over the past timesteps, indicating the obstacle is getting closer.
    - Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 5
    - Lateral Distance Safety Score: 0 
    - Overall Distance Safety Score: 5 * 1.0 + 0 * (1 - 1.0) = 5.0
    - Time Risk Reason: TTClong is 12.69s, which is > 5, indicating negligible risk longitudinally. TTClat is 0.00s, indicating a collision laterally. The TTClong has generally been decreasing.
    - Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 5
    - Lateral Time Safety Score: 0
    - Overall Time Safety Score: 5 * 1.0 + 0 * (1 - 1.0) = 5.0
    - Overall Risk Score: 0.5 * 5.0 + 0.5 * 5.0 = 5

    - Obstacle ID: 30306
    - Relative Direction: Behind
    - Distance Risk Reason: DTClong is -0.12m, indicating an extremely high risk of collision as the obstacle is very close behind the ego vehicle. This distance has been rapidly decreasing over the timesteps.
    - Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 1
    - Lateral Distance Safety Score: 0
    - Overall Distance Safety Score: 1 * 1.0 + 0 * (1-1.0) = 1.0
    - Time Risk Reason: TTClong is 0.05s, indicating an extremely high risk of collision longitudinally as the time to collision is very short. This has been consistently decreasing. TTClat is 0, indicating no lateral movement.
    - Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 1
    - Lateral Time Safety Score: 0
    - Overall Time Safety Score: 1 * 1.0 + 0 * (1 - 1.0) = 1.0
    - Overall Risk Score: 0.5 * 1.0 + 0.5 * 1.0 = 1

    - Obstacle ID: 30307
    - Relative Direction: Behind
    - Distance Risk Reason: DTClong is -16.39m, which is < -5, indicating negligible risk longitudinally. DTClat is 0.00m, indicating no lateral risk. DTClong has been increasing over time, suggesting the obstacle is moving further away. 
    - Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 5
    - Lateral Distance Safety Score: 0
    - Overall Distance Safety Score: 5 * 1.0 + 0 * (1-1.0) = 5.0
    - Time Risk Reason: TTClong is 4.39s, which is between 3 and 5, indicating a low longitudinal risk. TTClat is 0, indicating no lateral risk. The TTClong has been relatively stable.
    - Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 4
    - Lateral Time Safety Score: 0
    - Overall Time Safety Score: 4 * 1.0 + 0 * (1-1.0) = 4.0
    - Overall Risk Score: 0.5 * 5.0 + 0.5 * 4.0 = 4.5 â‰ˆ 5
