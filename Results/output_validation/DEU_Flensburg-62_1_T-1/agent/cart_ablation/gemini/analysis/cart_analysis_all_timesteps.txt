Here's the collision risk analysis:

**Analysis:**

The ego vehicle's y-coordinate remains relatively constant, decreasing slightly over the provided timesteps. The x-coordinate steadily increases, indicating forward movement.  The ego vehicle's velocity decreases and acceleration becomes increasingly negative, suggesting braking, potentially hard braking.

Obstacle 346 is virtually stationary and far from the ego vehicle, posing no immediate threat.

Obstacles 354, 360, and 367 are also moving very slowly and their y-coordinates are close to the ego vehicle, with Obstacle 367 being the nearest longitudinally. While the current data doesn't indicate an immediate collision, the ego vehicle's deceleration and the proximity of obstacle 367 necessitates monitoring and suggests increased risk, especially as the ego vehicle appears to be braking while approaching the slower obstacle.  Additional future timesteps are necessary for precise risk assessment.

Given the ego vehicle's braking behavior and the proximity of obstacle 367, a predictive element is required. Although not currently at extreme risk, obstacle 367 has the potential to become an extreme risk if the ego vehicle continues its current deceleration trend and the obstacle maintains its current velocity.  This scenario needs to be considered due to the high closing velocity and proximity.

**Risk Assessment:**

* **Obstacle 346:** Negligible Risk (5) - Far away and almost stationary.
* **Obstacle 354:** Medium Risk (3) - Relatively close laterally, but slow-moving and further ahead longitudinally.
* **Obstacle 360:** Medium Risk (3)  - Closer to the ego vehicle than 354 but still not extremely high risk
* **Obstacle 367:** High Risk (2) - Closest to the ego vehicle with a considerable closing speed as the ego brakes. High risk given the current trajectory trends.

* **Predicted Risk for Obstacle 367:** Extreme Risk (1) - Based on current deceleration of ego vehicle and the relatively static position of obstacle 367, if the trends continue, extreme risk is predicted in the next few timesteps.
