Obstacle 346: This obstacle is far from the ego vehicle and its velocity is very low and decreasing.  It poses a negligible risk.

Obstacle 354: This obstacle is also far from the ego vehicle and its velocity is very low and decreasing. It poses a negligible risk.

Obstacle 360: This obstacle is closer to the ego vehicle than 346 and 354, but still relatively far. Its velocity is low and decreasing.  It poses a low risk.

Obstacle 367: This obstacle is the closest to the ego vehicle. While its velocity is decreasing, the ego vehicle's velocity is also decreasing at a faster rate and its position is getting considerably closer over the timesteps. Therefore, there is a risk of a collision. If the current trends continue, a collision is highly likely within the next few seconds. This represents an Extreme Risk.
