The ego vehicle's velocity is decreasing significantly over the timesteps, suggesting heavy braking or deceleration.  Several obstacles are nearly stationary ahead of the ego vehicle in the same lane.  Obstacle 367 shows the most significant relative motion towards the ego vehicle, but all obstacles in the same lane should be evaluated for potential collision given the ego vehicle's deceleration. Note that constant velocity, straight-line projections are assumed for TTC and MDC calculations in this analysis given the limited data.  More sophisticated projections could be used in a real system.

Focusing on the most recent timestep (5.1 seconds):

* **Obstacle 367:** This obstacle poses the highest risk due to its forward movement and the ego vehicle's rapid deceleration. While its velocity is also decreasing, a collision is possible if these trends continue.  TTC and MDC values would need to be computed to quantify this risk accurately. Given the available information, a risk score of 2 (High Risk) seems appropriate.
* **Obstacles 346, 354, 360:** These obstacles are nearly stationary. The primary risk comes from the ego vehicle's deceleration. They require monitoring but pose a lower immediate risk than Obstacle 367. More precise position data would be necessary for accurate assessment. A risk score of 3 (Medium Risk) is assigned due to the potential for collision if the ego vehicle continues decelerating rapidly.
