In this scenario, we analyze the motion of the ego vehicle and its surrounding obstacles from timestamp 4.2 to 5.1 seconds to determine risk levels. The ego vehicle has a consistent trajectory, but its speed is significantly higher than any obstacle, moving steadily along its path with decreasing velocity due to negative acceleration. All obstacles are in the same lanelet as the ego and move minimally over the 10-time step interval, indicating stationary or near-stationary positions.

The primary considerations for risk analysis are Time to Collision (TTC) and Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC). At the latest timestamp, 5.1 seconds, we evaluate distances and velocities:

- **Obstacle 346**: Since its position barely changes and has extremely low velocity, its TTC with the ego remains extremely high (indicating no risk of sudden collision), resulting in a risk score of 5.

- **Obstacle 354**: Similarly near-stationary; TTC is very high due to the low relative velocity between the ego moving steadily away from this obstacle.

- **Obstacle 360**: Moves slightly but remains significantly behind the ego vehicle concerning relative positional distance and orientation changes. No collision is imminent, keeping the TTC high.

- **Obstacle 367**: Although moving at a slightly higher velocity compared to others, it remains well behind the ego, with a TTC significantly higher than any immediate concern thresholds. Its highest acceleration indicates it could potentially build speed, but it's still not substantial enough to pose immediate risk.

Considering each obstacle's lack of significant motion changes, very minimal velocities, and adequate distance for maneuver, none reach risk levels requiring immediate intervention to the point of scoring 0 (collision) or 1 (extreme risk). The risk is generally low across the board with no precursors for imminent collision conditions.

Here's the JSON output encapsulating these insights:

```json
{
    "CollisionObstacles": [],
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {},
    "HighRiskObstacle": {}
}
```

This result indicates no immediate collision risks in this scenario, as every obstacle adheres to a manageable distance and velocity relationship with the ego vehicle.
