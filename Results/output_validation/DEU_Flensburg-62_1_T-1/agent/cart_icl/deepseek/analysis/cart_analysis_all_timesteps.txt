### Analysis:

1. **Obstacle 367.0**:
   - **Position**: (459.97891, -70.571019) at 5.1s, moving towards the ego vehicle.
   - **Velocity**: 0.016156466 m/s (very slow but moving).
   - **Acceleration**: -0.012672099 m/s² (decelerating slightly).
   - **Relative Motion**: The ego vehicle is decelerating but still moving towards the obstacle. The distance between the ego and obstacle 367.0 is decreasing over time.
   - **TTC**: The relative velocity is low, but the distance is closing. Given the deceleration of the ego vehicle, the TTC is not immediate but warrants attention.
   - **Risk**: **High Risk (2)** due to decreasing distance and potential for collision if trends continue.

2. **Obstacle 360.0**:
   - **Position**: (466.78573, -72.64635) at 5.1s, moving towards the ego vehicle.
   - **Velocity**: 0.0034375104 m/s (very slow but moving).
   - **Acceleration**: -0.0020797172 m/s² (decelerating slightly).
   - **Relative Motion**: The ego vehicle is decelerating but still moving towards the obstacle. The distance between the ego and obstacle 360.0 is decreasing over time.
   - **TTC**: The relative velocity is low, but the distance is closing. Given the deceleration of the ego vehicle, the TTC is not immediate but warrants attention.
   - **Risk**: **Medium Risk (3)** due to decreasing distance but low relative velocity.

3. **Obstacle 354.0**:
   - **Position**: (473.21465, -74.600977) at 5.1s, moving towards the ego vehicle.
   - **Velocity**: 0.00059643929 m/s (very slow but moving).
   - **Acceleration**: -0.00058204399 m/s² (decelerating slightly).
   - **Relative Motion**: The ego vehicle is decelerating but still moving towards the obstacle. The distance between the ego and obstacle 354.0 is decreasing over time.
   - **TTC**: The relative velocity is extremely low, and the distance is closing very slowly.
   - **Risk**: **Low Risk (4)** due to very low relative velocity and slow closing distance.

4. **Obstacle 346.0**:
   - **Position**: (479.69318, -76.504239) at 5.1s, almost stationary.
   - **Velocity**: 7.1023736e-05 m/s (negligible).
   - **Acceleration**: -6.7005027e-05 m/s² (negligible).
   - **Relative Motion**: The ego vehicle is moving towards the obstacle, but the distance is large and the obstacle is almost stationary.
   - **TTC**: The relative velocity is negligible, and the distance is very large.
   - **Risk**: **Negligible Risk (5)** due to negligible relative velocity and large distance.
