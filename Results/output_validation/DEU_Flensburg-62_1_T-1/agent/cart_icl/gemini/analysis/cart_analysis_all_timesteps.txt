Here's the analysis of the scenario focusing on the most recent timestep (5.1 seconds) and considering the trends from earlier timesteps:

**Ego Vehicle Analysis:** The ego vehicle is decelerating significantly across the timesteps, likely performing a braking maneuver. Its orientation is also changing, suggesting some steering input.

**Obstacle Analysis:** All obstacles appear to be moving very slowly or are nearly stationary within the provided timeframe.  The primary concern stems from their positions relative to the decelerating ego vehicle. Let's analyze the closest obstacles:

* **Obstacle 367:** This obstacle is the closest to the ego vehicle and in the same lanelet. While it's moving slowly, the ego vehicle's rapid deceleration needs careful assessment for a potential rear-end collision.  Given the trend, this poses a significant risk.

* **Obstacle 360:** This obstacle is further ahead than 367 but still in the same lanelet.  Its slow speed and the ego's deceleration mean it also requires monitoring. However, the risk is less immediate than with obstacle 367.

* **Obstacles 354 and 346:** These are relatively far from the ego vehicle and their slow speeds pose less of a risk in the immediate future. The larger distance gives the ego vehicle more time to react.

**Risk Assessment (at 5.1s):**

* **Obstacle 367:** High Risk (2). While not immediately colliding, the closing speed and ego vehicle's deceleration warrant a high-risk assessment. Urgent action may be needed to avoid a collision.
* **Obstacle 360:** Medium Risk (3). Requires continued monitoring but the risk is less immediate.
* **Obstacle 354:** Low risk (4)
* **Obstacle 346:** Low Risk (4)
