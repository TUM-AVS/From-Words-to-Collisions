To evaluate the risks associated with the given obstacles compared to the ego vehicle, we will closely analyze the positions, velocities, and acceleration data, particularly focusing on the latest timestep (5.1 seconds).

### Analysis:

**Ego Vehicle** at 5.1 seconds:  
- Position: (455.3768, -68.2182)
- Orientation: -0.2467837153180405  
- Velocity: 2.0869 m/s

**Obstacles**:

1. **Obstacle 346**:
   - Position: (479.69318, -76.504239)  
   - Velocity: Very low (7.1023736e-05 m/s), effectively static compared to Ego.  
   - **Assessment**: Very distant and almost stationary. **Negligible Risk (5)**

2. **Obstacle 354**:
   - Position: (473.21465, -74.600977)  
   - Velocity: 0.00059643929 m/s  
   - **Assessment**: Stationary and far from the Ego vehicle. **Negligible Risk (5)**

3. **Obstacle 360**:
   - Position: (466.78573, -72.64635)  
   - Velocity: 0.0034375104 m/s   
   - **Assessment**: Stationary and safe distance from Ego. **Negligible Risk (5)**

4. **Obstacle 367**:
   - Position: (459.97891, -70.571019)  
   - Velocity: 0.016156466 m/s  
   - **Assessment**: Slowly moving, still at a safe distance. **Low Risk (4)**

**Summary**:
- Distances are sufficiently large and obstacles are either stationary or moving very slowly. Considering trends, there is no immediate danger from any obstacles.
- No collisions or extreme risk scenarios were identified in this evaluation.

### JSON Output

```json
{
    "CollisionObstacles": [],
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null,
    "HighRiskObstacle": null
}
```

The analysis indicates that there are no imminent risks or potential collisions, as all obstacles maintain a negligible or low threat level relative to the Ego vehicle, consistent with the risk calculations and trajectory assessments.
