At t=5.1 seconds, Obstacle 367 poses the most significant risk to the ego vehicle. It's located almost directly in front of the ego vehicle (0.53m longitudinal distance, 0 lateral distance) and closing at a speed of -2.07 m/s, resulting in both MDC and TTC falling into the range for a Risk Score of 2 (High Risk).

Obstacle 360, while farther away longitudinally (7.64m), is also positioned directly ahead of the ego vehicle (0 lateral distance) and approaching at -2.08 m/s.  While its MDC suggests only a medium risk, the closing longitudinal velocity is cause for concern. Its TTC pushes it close to a Risk Score of 3 but since we only report Risk Score 0, 1, and 2 we will treat this one as medium risk. It requires attention but with proper reaction time, a collision can be avoided.

Obstacles 346 and 354 are moving away laterally to the right and have a large longitudinal distance which indicates that these obstacles are low risk.
