At t=5.1s, Obstacle 367 is located in front of the ego vehicle, at a longitudinal distance of 0.53 meters. With a closing velocity of -2.07 m/s, a collision is imminent within the next timestep.  Obstacle 360 is also in front of the ego vehicle, at a longitudinal distance of 7.64 meters with a closing velocity of -2.08 m/s.  Given the closing velocity and distance, although a collision is not imminent in the very next timestep as with Obstacle 367,  it is highly probable shortly thereafter, representing an extreme risk. Obstacles 346 and 354 are further away longitudinally, and though they present a high risk, they are not immediately dangerous as 360 and 367.

Risk Levels:
0: Collision - Physical contact occurred or unavoidable
1: Extreme Risk - Immediate collision likely
2: High Risk - Close to collision, needs quick action
3: Medium Risk - Manageable with proper reaction
4: Low Risk - Minimal risk, sufficient time to react
5: Negligible Risk - No significant risk
