### Safety analysis for timestep 5.1s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

**Assumptions and Clarifications:**

* The prompt mentions "adjusted distances" (adjusted_d_long, adjusted_d_lat). However, these values are not provided in the scenario context.  Therefore, the analysis will be based on the provided *real distances* (DTClong, DTClat), acknowledging that this might not be fully accurate without the adjusted values.
* We'll assume a simplified TTC calculation: TTC = Distance / Relative Velocity. This is a simplification, and a more robust approach would consider acceleration and non-linear motion.
* We are considering both longitudinal and lateral movements for a more comprehensive risk assessment.  However, since the obstacles are moving primarily longitudinally and laterally away from the ego vehicle, the longitudinal TTC and distance will be the primary factors for risk assessment.


### Obstacle Analysis:

**- Obstacle ID: 346**
- Distance Risk reason: DTClong = 21.10m, DTClat = 21.10m, and located Front-right. The obstacle is far from the ego vehicle.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: The obstacle is moving towards the ego vehicle longitudinally (Vrel_long = -2.09 m/s), but the large distance mitigates the risk. Assuming constant velocity, TTClong ≈ 10.1 seconds.  The obstacle is moving away laterally (Vrel_lat=-0.00m/s)
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

**- Obstacle ID: 354**
- Distance Risk reason: DTClong = 14.35m, DTClat = 14.35m, and located Front-right. The obstacle is far from the ego vehicle.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason:  The obstacle is moving towards the ego vehicle longitudinally (Vrel_long = -2.09 m/s), but the distance mitigates the risk. Assuming constant velocity, TTClong ≈ 6.9 seconds. The obstacle is moving away laterally (Vrel_lat=-0.00m/s)
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

**- Obstacle ID: 360**
- Distance Risk reason: DTClong = 7.64m, DTClat = 7.64m, and located Front. The obstacle is far from the ego vehicle.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: The obstacle is moving towards the ego vehicle longitudinally (Vrel_long = -2.08 m/s). Assuming constant velocity, TTClong ≈ 3.7 seconds. The obstacle is moving away laterally (Vrel_lat=-0.00m/s)
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

**- Obstacle ID: 367**
- Distance Risk reason: DTClong = 0.53m, DTClat = 0.53m, and located Front.  The obstacle is extremely close to the ego vehicle.
- Distance safety score: 1
- Time Risk reason: The obstacle is moving towards the ego vehicle longitudinally (Vrel_long = -2.07 m/s). Assuming constant velocity, TTClong ≈ 0.26 seconds. The obstacle is not moving much laterally (Vrel_lat=-0.00m/s)
- Time safety score: 1
- Overall Risk score: 1
