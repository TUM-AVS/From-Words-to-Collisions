At t=5.1s:

* **Obstacle 346:** Front-right, longitudinal 21.10m, lateral -0.48m. Relative velocity: longitudinal -2.09 m/s, lateral -0.00 m/s.  The obstacle is moving away longitudinally and laterally. Risk level: 5 (Negligible Risk).

* **Obstacle 354:** Front-right, longitudinal 14.35m, lateral -0.22m. Relative velocity: longitudinal -2.09 m/s, lateral -0.00 m/s. The obstacle is moving away longitudinally and laterally. Risk level: 5 (Negligible Risk).

* **Obstacle 360:** Front, longitudinal 7.64m, lateral 0.00m. Relative velocity: longitudinal -2.08 m/s, lateral -0.00 m/s. The obstacle is moving away longitudinally. Lateral alignment but no lateral velocity suggests parallel movement. Risk level: 4 (Low Risk).

* **Obstacle 367:** Front, longitudinal 0.53m, lateral 0.00m. Relative velocity: longitudinal -2.07 m/s, lateral -0.00 m/s. Though distances are small and there is longitudinal alignment, the negative longitudinal velocity indicates the obstacle is moving away from the ego vehicle.  Thus, this is NOT a collision situation, but a near miss. Risk level: 1 (Extreme Risk).
