At t=5.3s, the ego vehicle at (455.7845, -68.322) is moving with a velocity of 1.9157 and decelerating at -0.4173.  Obstacle 367 is the closest, located at (459.98169, -70.571868) with a velocity of 0.01429 and decelerating at -0.010857. While the vehicles are in the same lanelet (345), the relatively low speeds and decelerations of both the ego vehicle and Obstacle 367, combined with the increasing distance between them over the observed time steps, suggest a decreasing risk of collision. Obstacle 360 and other preceding obstacles are farther away and pose even less risk. New obstacle 349 is located in a different lanelet and does not pose an immediate risk at this timestep. Therefore, at this timestep, no obstacle presents an extreme or collision risk.
