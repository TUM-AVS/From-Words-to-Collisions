At t=5.3s, the ego vehicle at (455.7845, -68.322) is braking (negative acceleration) and moving at 1.9157 velocity. Obstacle 367 at (459.98169, -70.571868) is also decelerating and moving considerably slower at 0.01429 velocity.  While in the same lane, the substantial speed difference and deceleration of both suggest a decreasing risk of collision, especially considering Obstacle 367's slow speed. Other obstacles are much further away and pose negligible risk in this timestep. Obstacle 349, while appearing suddenly and having a high velocity, is located in a different lanelet (344 vs 345). Therefore, it's not considered a high risk at this point.

        "Reasoning": "No obstacle poses immediate collision risk at t=5.3s. Though obstacle 367 is in the same lane and ahead, its slow speed and deceleration, coupled with the ego vehicle's braking, reduce immediate risk."
