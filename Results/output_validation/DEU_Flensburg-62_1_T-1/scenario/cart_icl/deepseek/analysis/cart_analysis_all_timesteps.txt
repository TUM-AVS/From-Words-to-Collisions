### Safety Analysis for the Most Recent Timestep (5.3s):

### Obstacle Analysis:

1. **Obstacle 38**:
   - Distance Risk: Moving towards ego in same lanelet (345), distance decreasing (344.86324, -28.315195 to 345.36355, -28.863337)
   - Distance safety score: 2 (High Risk)
   - Time Risk: High velocity (7.439), accelerating (2.569)
   - Time safety score: 1 (Extreme Risk)
   - Overall Risk score: 1 (Extreme Risk)

2. **Obstacle 323**:
   - Distance Risk: Moving towards ego in adjacent lanelet (965), distance decreasing
   - Distance safety score: 3 (Medium Risk)
   - Time Risk: Low velocity (0.0087), decelerating
   - Time safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
   - Overall Risk score: 3 (Medium Risk)

3. **Obstacle 349**:
   - Distance Risk: Moving away from ego in lanelet 344
   - Distance safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - Time Risk: High velocity (12.278) but diverging path
   - Time safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
   - Overall Risk score: 4 (Low Risk)

4. **Obstacle 384**:
   - Distance Risk: In same lanelet (345), moving parallel
   - Distance safety score: 3 (Medium Risk)
   - Time Risk: Velocity 6.867, decelerating
   - Time safety score: 3 (Medium Risk)
   - Overall Risk score: 3 (Medium Risk)

5. **Obstacle 389**:
   - Distance Risk: In same lanelet (345), moving towards ego
   - Distance safety score: 2 (High Risk)
   - Time Risk: Velocity 10.406, decelerating
   - Time safety score: 2 (High Risk)
   - Overall Risk score: 2 (High Risk)

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. Ego is in lanelet 345 with decreasing velocity (1.9157 m/s)
2. Obstacle 38 is in same lanelet approaching at high speed (7.439 m/s)
3. TTC calculation shows potential collision within next few timesteps
4. Other obstacles either moving away or in adjacent lanelets
5. No actual collision at current timestep, but extreme risk of imminent collision
