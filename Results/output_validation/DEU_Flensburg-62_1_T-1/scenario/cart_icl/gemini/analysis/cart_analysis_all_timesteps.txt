### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 346.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle far away and essentially stationary. No risk observed in the provided trajectory.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Obstacle's minimal velocity and acceleration pose no immediate threat.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 349.0
- Distance Risk reason: This obstacle appears suddenly and is in a different lane.  Based on its high velocity and current position, it represents a potential risk. More data needed to accurately predict future trajectory relative to the ego vehicle.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: The high velocity and acceleration requires careful monitoring even though it is in a different lane. Potential lane change by either vehicle needs to be considered.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3

- Obstacle ID: 354.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle nearly stationary and poses no immediate risk based on its trajectory over the last 10 timesteps.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Minimal movement observed, hence no significant time-related risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 360.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle slowing down and fairly distant. No risk observed.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Decelerating trend suggests reducing risk. No immediate time-related risk.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- Obstacle ID: 367.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle decelerating but proximity requires attention.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: Deceleration reduces risk, but still close in proximity. 
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3


### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
No immediate collision detected in the current timestep. However, obstacle 349.0 merits close observation due to its sudden appearance, high velocity, and different lane. No obstacle has a risk score of 0 or 1. Therefore, this is not a collision scenario.


### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
  "CollisionObstacles": null,
  "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null,
  "ScenarioAnalysis": {
    "IsCollisionScenario": false,
    "Reasoning": "No obstacle has a risk score of 0 (collision) or 1 (extreme risk). Obstacle 349 warrants monitoring due to its sudden appearance at high speed in another lane."
  }
}
```
