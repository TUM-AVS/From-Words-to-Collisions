### Obstacle Analysis:

#### Obstacle ID: 346.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: This obstacle is far from the ego vehicle, with minimal positional change over previous timesteps, indicating no immediate threat.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: It exhibits almost no velocity, suggesting no future path intersection with the ego vehicle.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 354.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: This obstacle remains relatively stationary in its position relative to the ego vehicle, so it poses no significant distance risk.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: Very low velocity and consistent trajectory reduce any time-based collision risks.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 360.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle maintains a small but consistent distance from the ego vehicle, showing low collision probability.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: Its minimal velocity implies non-threatening movement relative to the ego vehicle.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 367.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle moves slowly away from the ego vehicle, minimizing immediate collision risk.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: Despite a small velocity, its trajectory diverges from the ego vehicle over time.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 349.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: This obstacle has recently appeared with high velocity but is currently at a significant distance.
- **Distance safety score**: 4
- **Time Risk reason**: While moving fast, it is initially out of lanelet 345.0 and poses minimal near-future collision threat.
- **Time safety score**: 4
- **Overall Risk score**: 4

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
Based on the above evaluations, all obstacles have been found not significantly altering their position relative to the ego vehicle and are moving at low velocities with little chance to interfere with the ego vehicle's path, ensuring a stable, non-collision scenario.
