Obstacle 367 is at high risk of collision with the ego vehicle. It is only 0.15 meters away longitudinally, indicating an imminent collision if the current trajectories are maintained.  The lateral distance is 0.00 m, meaning it's directly in front of the ego vehicle. The relative velocity and acceleration suggest that the obstacle is moving towards the ego vehicle.
