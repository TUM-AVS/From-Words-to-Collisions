### Safety analysis for timestep 4.4s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- **Obstacle ID:** 346
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is at a safe distance (21.11m longitudinally and laterally) and moving away laterally.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason:  Although moving towards the ego vehicle longitudinally, the relative velocity is low and distance is large.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- **Obstacle ID:** 354
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is at a relatively safe distance (14.74m longitudinally and laterally) and moving away laterally.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Although moving towards the ego vehicle longitudinally, the relative velocity is low and distance is moderate.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3

- **Obstacle ID:** 360
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is at a moderate distance (8.42m longitudinally and laterally) and moving away laterally.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason:  Moving towards the ego vehicle longitudinally, the relative velocity is low, but the distance is becoming a concern.
- Time safety score: 2
- Overall Risk score: 2

- **Obstacle ID:** 367
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is very close (1.72m longitudinally and laterally).
- Distance safety score: 1
- Time Risk reason: Moving towards the ego vehicle longitudinally, the close proximity and relative velocity indicate high risk. TTC is approximately 0.65 seconds (1.72m / 2.67m/s).
- Time safety score: 1
- Overall Risk score: 1


### Safety analysis for timestep 4.5s - 5.3s:
*Analysis for Obstacle 367 continues to show extreme risk (Overall Risk score 1) in subsequent timesteps, with distance to the ego vehicle decreasing.  At 5.3 seconds, the longitudinal distance is a mere 0.15m, indicating imminent collision.*

*All other obstacles (346, 354, 360, and the newly introduced 349) maintain safe distances and lateral movement away from the ego vehicle during these timesteps. Though their longitudinal distances decrease slightly in some instances, the risk remains low to medium (Overall Risk score 2-4) as the relative longitudinal velocities also decrease. These obstacles do not pose an immediate threat.*


### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
  "CollisionObstacle": {
    "ObstacleID": "367",
    "OverallRiskScore": "0"
  },
  "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null,
  "IsCollisionScenario": true,
  "Justification": "Obstacle 367 shows a consistent and rapid decrease in distance to the ego vehicle over the analyzed timesteps.  At 5.3 seconds, the extremely close proximity (0.15m longitudinally) and the continuing relative longitudinal velocity indicate a collision has likely occurred."
