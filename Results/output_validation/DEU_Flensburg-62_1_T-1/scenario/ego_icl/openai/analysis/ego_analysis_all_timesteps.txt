### Analysis of the Most Recent Timestep (5.3 seconds):

#### Obstacle 346:
- **Position:** Front of the ego vehicle
- **Adjusted Distances:** Longitudinal 20.73 m, Lateral 0.00 m
- **Relative Velocity:** Longitudinal -1.92 m/s
- **Trajectory:** Moving toward ego vehicle longitudinally
- **TTC Calculation:**
  - Longitudinal TTC = 20.73 m / 1.92 m/s ≈ 10.80 seconds
- **MDC Calculation:** Since longitudinal distance is significantly larger and closing slowly, MDC > 5.0 m
- **Assessment:** No risk (5) due to large longitudinal separation

#### Obstacle 349:
- **Position:** Front-left of the ego vehicle
- **Adjusted Distances:** Longitudinal 24.30 m, Lateral 0.69 m
- **Relative Velocity:** Longitudinal -14.19 m/s, Lateral -0.45 m/s
- **Trajectory:** Moving toward ego vehicle longitudinally and laterally from the left
- **TTC Calculation:**
  - Longitudinal TTC = 24.30 m / 14.19 m/s ≈ 1.71 seconds
- **MDC Calculation:** Given relative high speeds, minimum distance around 1.5 m (front-left trajectory) assuming consistent trajectories
- **Assessment:** Medium Risk (3) due to potential paths intersecting

#### Obstacle 354:
- **Position:** Front of the ego vehicle
- **Adjusted Distances:** Longitudinal 13.98 m, Lateral 0.00 m
- **Relative Velocity:** Longitudinal -1.92 m/s
- **Trajectory:** Moving toward ego vehicle longitudinally
- **TTC Calculation:**
  - Longitudinal TTC = 13.98 m / 1.92 m/s ≈ 7.28 seconds
- **MDC Calculation:** Longitudinal distance is reducing, but still significant
- **Assessment:** Low Risk (4) due to moderate longitudinal separation

#### Obstacle 360:
- **Position:** Front of the ego vehicle
- **Adjusted Distances:** Longitudinal 7.26 m, Lateral 0.00 m
- **Relative Velocity:** Longitudinal -1.91 m/s
- **Trajectory:** Moving toward ego vehicle longitudinally
- **TTC Calculation:**
  - Longitudinal TTC = 7.26 m / 1.91 m/s ≈ 3.80 seconds
- **MDC Calculation:** Longitudinal distance is closing, but still larger than threshold
- **Assessment:** Medium Risk (3) due to moderate separation

#### Obstacle 367:
- **Position:** Front of the ego vehicle
- **Adjusted Distances:** Longitudinal 0.15 m, Lateral 0.00 m
- **Relative Velocity:** Longitudinal -1.90 m/s
- **Trajectory:** Moving toward ego vehicle longitudinally and exact lateral alignment
- **TTC Calculation:**
  - Longitudinal TTC = 0.15 m / 1.90 m/s ≈ 0.08 seconds
- **MDC Calculation:** MDC < 0.5 m indicating converging paths with extremely close proximity
- **Assessment:** Collision Occurring (0) due to immediate proximity and alignment both longitudinally and laterally

### Determination of Collision Scenario:
- Obstacle 367 is identified as a collision scenario based on its current position, trajectory, and very low longitudinal separation with converging paths.

### Conclusion:
- This is a collision scenario primarily because Obstacle 367 is on direct collision trajectory with the ego vehicle, with longitudinal distance nearly zero and exact lateral alignment, combined with negative relative velocity indicating approach.
