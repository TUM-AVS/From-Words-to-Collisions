### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
    - Obstacle ID: 346
    - Relative Direction: Front
    - Distance Risk Reason: DTClong is 20.73m, indicating a safe longitudinal distance. DTClat is 0.0m, meaning it's directly in front.  While previously Front-Right and moving away laterally, it is now directly in front.
    - Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 5
    - Lateral Distance Safety Score: 0
    - Overall Distance Safety Score: 5 * 1.0 + 0 * (1-1.0) = 5.0
    - Time Risk Reason: TTClong is high at 10.82s, but TTClat is 0.0s because it is aligned laterally. Previous timesteps showed it moving away laterally, but it's now centered.
    - Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 5
    - Lateral Time Safety Score: 0
    - Overall Time Safety Score: 5 * 1.0 + 0 * (1-1.0) = 5.0
    - Overall Risk Score: 0.5 * 5.0 + 0.5 * 5.0 = 5

    - Obstacle ID: 349
    - Relative Direction: Front-left
    - Distance Risk Reason: DTClong is 24.30m and DTClat is 0.69m.  Both are safe distances.
    - Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 5
    - Lateral Distance Safety Score: 1
    - Overall Distance Safety Score: 5 * 0.5 + 1 * (1-0.5) = 3.0
    - Time Risk Reason: TTClong is 1.71s and TTClat is 1.53s indicating a medium-to-high risk time to collision.
    - Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 3
    - Lateral Time Safety Score: 3
    - Overall Time Safety Score: 3 * 0.5 + 3 * (1 - 0.5) = 3.0
    - Overall Risk Score: 0.5 * 3.0 + 0.5 * 3.0 = 3

    - Obstacle ID: 354
    - Relative Direction: Front
    - Distance Risk Reason: DTClong is 13.98m, a safe distance. DTClat is 0.0m, directly ahead. It was previously Front-Right but is now centered.
    - Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 5
    - Lateral Distance Safety Score: 0
    - Overall Distance Safety Score: 5 * 1.0 + 0 * (1-1.0) = 5.0
    - Time Risk Reason: TTClong is 7.30s, but TTClat is 0.0s as it's now centered.
    - Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 5
    - Lateral Time Safety Score: 0
    - Overall Time Safety Score: 5 * 1.0 + 0 * (1-1.0) = 5.0
    - Overall Risk Score: 0.5 * 5.0 + 0.5 * 5.0 = 5
    
    - Obstacle ID: 360
    - Relative Direction: Front
    - Distance Risk Reason: DTClong is 7.26m, a moderate distance. DTClat is 0.0m, meaning centered longitudinally.  Previously Front-Right and moving right, it's now centered.
    - Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 5
    - Lateral Distance Safety Score: 0
    - Overall Distance Safety Score: 5 * 1.0 + 0 * (1.0-1.0) = 5.0
    - Time Risk Reason: TTClong is 3.80s, indicating moderate risk, while TTClat is 0.0s indicating high risk.
    - Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 4
    - Lateral Time Safety Score: 0
    - Overall Time Safety Score: 4 * 1.0 + 0 * (1-1.0) = 4.0
    - Overall Risk Score: 0.5 * 5.0 + 0.5 * 4.0 = 4.5 ≈ 5

    - Obstacle ID: 367
    - Relative Direction: Front
    - Distance Risk Reason: DTClong is extremely close at 0.15m, while DTClat is 0.0m.  This obstacle was consistently approaching in previous timesteps.
    - Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 0
    - Lateral Distance Safety Score: 0
    - Overall Distance Safety Score: 0 * 1.0 + 0 * (1-1.0) = 0.0
    - Time Risk Reason:  TTClong is critically low at 0.08s and TTClat is 0.0s. Previous timesteps confirm the imminent collision.
    - Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 0
    - Lateral Time Safety Score: 0
    - Overall Time Safety Score: 0 * 1.0 + 0 * (1-1.0) = 0.0
    - Overall Risk Score: 0.5 * 0.0 + 0.5 * 0.0 = 0.0 ≈ 0
