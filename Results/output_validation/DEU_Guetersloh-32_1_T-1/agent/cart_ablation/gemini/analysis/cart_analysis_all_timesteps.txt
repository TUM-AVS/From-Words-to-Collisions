Here's the collision risk analysis:

**Obstacle 31:** This obstacle is moving quickly in a different lanelet and poses no immediate threat.  Risk Score: 5

**Obstacle 33:** This obstacle is in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle and is relatively close. While there isn't an immediate collision, the continuous decrease in the distance between the two, along with Obstacle 33's acceleration towards the ego vehicle warrants attention. The trajectories over the next few timesteps suggest a high probability of an imminent collision if the ego vehicle doesn't react. Risk Score: 1.

**Obstacle 35:** This obstacle is in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle and is approaching from behind. While its velocity suggests it is catching up to the ego vehicle, the separation is greater and the converging trajectories appear less severe compared to those of the ego vehicle and Obstacle 33. Risk Score: 2.

**Obstacle 310:** This obstacle is behind the ego vehicle and maintains some separation, exhibiting no aggressive behavior.  Risk Score: 4

**Obstacle 331:** This obstacle is in a neighboring lanelet and its trajectory shows movement away from the ego vehicle, mitigating risk.  Risk Score: 5

**Obstacle 338:** This obstacle is located in a different lanelet and far away from the ego vehicle and is therefore no concern. Risk Score: 5

**Obstacle 348:** This obstacle appears stationary and relatively far away from the ego vehicle's path in a different lanelet.  Risk Score: 5
