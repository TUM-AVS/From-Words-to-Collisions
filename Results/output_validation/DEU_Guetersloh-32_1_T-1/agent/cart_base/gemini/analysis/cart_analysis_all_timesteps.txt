Obstacle 31: This obstacle is located in a different lanelet (78759.0) than the ego vehicle (77979.0 and 78281.0) and is moving away from the ego vehicle.  It poses no collision risk. Risk score: 5

Obstacle 33: This obstacle is in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle for the majority of the provided timestamps.  The positions are close and the speeds are converging, indicating a potential collision risk if the ego vehicle continues decelerating while obstacle 33 accelerates. The risk is increasing over the time steps. Risk score: 2

Obstacle 35:  This obstacle is in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle,  following closely behind. While there is some separation, the risk of collision increases if the ego vehicle continues to decelerate while obstacle 35 accelerates. The risk is increasing over the time steps. Risk score: 2


Obstacle 310: This obstacle is in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle, following even closer behind than Obstacle 35. The risk of a rear-end collision is elevated. Risk score: 2

Obstacle 331: This obstacle is located in lanelet 77980.0, which seems to be adjacent to the ego vehicle's lanelet. It's moving in a different direction, based on its positive orientation vs. the ego vehicle’s negative orientation, and it does not seem to represent a collision risk, particularly given the ego vehicle's transition to lanlet 78281 at 1.5s. Risk score: 5

Obstacle 338: This obstacle is consistently in a different lanelet and shows no indication of posing a risk. Risk score: 5

Obstacle 348: This static obstacle is first observed at 1.3 seconds.  While it doesn't pose an immediate risk in the current timestamps, further data is needed to determine if the ego vehicle’s trajectory might intersect with it, especially considering the ego vehicle is now in lanlet 78281 from 1.5s onwards. Risk score: 3
