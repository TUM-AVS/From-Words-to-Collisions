Obstacle 33 shows a concerning trend of decreasing distance to the ego vehicle over the provided timesteps.  Additional analysis is needed to determine TTC and MDC, but the current information suggests a potential collision risk. If the current acceleration and velocity trends continue for both Ego and Obstacle 33, a collision is likely.

Obstacle 35 is also in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle and exhibiting similar behavior to Obstacle 33, although slightly further away.  This obstacle requires careful monitoring.

Obstacle 331 is in a neighboring lanelet, but there is the possibility the two vehicles' paths may cross. This situation needs further evaluation to establish MDC and TTC.
