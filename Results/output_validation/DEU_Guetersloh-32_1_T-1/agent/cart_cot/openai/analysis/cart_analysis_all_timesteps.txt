Based on the provided scenario, we need to analyze the risk level for each object relative to the Ego vehicle at the most recent timestep (1.5 seconds).

### Analysis:

1. **Ego Vehicle**:
   - Current position: (-342.9136, 613.415)
   - Velocity: 2.2917 m/s

2. **Obstacles**:

    - **Obstacle 31** is not present in the final timestep, hence cannot be assessed for risk.
    
    - **Obstacle 33**:
      - Position: (-345.30948, 617.92813)
      - Velocity: 4.2104995 m/s
      - The obstacle is moving in the same lanelet and slightly backward relative to the Ego vehicle. Given the separation distance and the velocities, there is no immediate risk of collision.

    - **Obstacle 35**:
      - Position: (-348.86151, 624.98506)
      - Velocity: 3.5238384 m/s
      - Moving parallel and slightly ahead of the Ego vehicle. Separation is large enough to avoid collision in immediate steps.

    - **Obstacle 310**:
      - Position: (-353.54589, 631.48088)
      - Velocity: 1.7852408 m/s
      - Positionally ahead, and moving away; not an immediate threat.

    - **Obstacle 331**:
      - Position: (-350.09319, 635.62152)
      - Velocity: 7.7326634 m/s
      - In a different lanelet, moving rapidly across the path. Potential for higher risk due to higher velocity.

    - **Obstacle 338**:
      - Position: (-334.77385, 601.05528)
      - Velocity: 8.9569792 m/s
      - Far from the Ego vehicle and in a different trajectory; unlikely to collide directly.

    - **Obstacle 348**:
      - Position: (-313.14655, 615.83767)
      - Velocity: 0.0 m/s (stationary)
      - Stationary and in a different lanelet, no immediate risk.

### Summary:
- **Extreme Risk Obstacle: 331** - Due to its high speed and potential for crossing paths with the Ego vehicle trajectory, it poses a risk if trajectories converge due to wrong-time wrong-place scenarios.

Below is the correctly formatted JSON output:

```json
{
    "CollisionObstacles": [],
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "331",
        "OverallRiskScore": 1
    },
    "HighRiskObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "33",
        "OverallRiskScore": 2
    }
}
```
This output assumes Obstacle 33 could need monitoring due to its proximity, though Extreme Risk is highlighted for 331 due to potential dynamic changes in the environment.
