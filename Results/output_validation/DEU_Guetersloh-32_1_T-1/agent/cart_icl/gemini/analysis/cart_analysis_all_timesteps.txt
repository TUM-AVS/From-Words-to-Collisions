Obstacle 33 is in the same lane as the ego vehicle and is relatively close.  Over the past several timesteps, its velocity has been increasing while the ego vehicle's velocity was decreasing until the last couple of timesteps where the ego vehicle started accelerating.  Calculating a precise TTC is difficult without more detailed information about the vehicles' paths, but given the proximity and relative velocities and accelerations, there is a moderate risk of collision with Obstacle 33.

Obstacle 35 is also in the same lane and behind Obstacle 33. The risk of collision with Obstacle 35 is lower than that with Obstacle 33, as it is farther away.  However, it should be monitored.

Obstacle 310 is behind the ego vehicle, but it is also in the same lane and its velocity is increasing. Therefore, there is a medium risk associated with this obstacle.

Obstacle 331, though located in a different lanelet, shows a concerning trend. Its lateral distance to the ego vehicle might decrease significantly if the ego vehicle continues changing lanes as in the time steps from 1.4s to 1.5s. There is a moderate risk associated with this obstacle as well.
