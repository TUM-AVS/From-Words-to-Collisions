To evaluate the scenario, we'll take into account the given states across the different times, focusing particularly on the last timestep at 1.5 seconds. We'll analyze each obstacle's relative trajectory compared to the ego vehicle and assess the potential for collisions.

### Step-by-Step Evaluation

#### Ego Vehicle at 1.5 seconds
- Position: (-342.9136, 613.415)
- Orientation: -1.0883 rad
- Velocity: 2.2917 m/s
- Acceleration: 2.3204 m/sÂ²

#### Obstacle Analysis at 1.5 seconds

1. **Obstacle 33 (Lanelet 77979.0)**
   - Position: (-345.30948, 617.92813)
   - Velocity: 4.2105 m/s
   - Distance to Ego: Roughly 5.24 meters
   - Relative speed indicates it's moving faster but lateral distance is not causing immediate risk.

2. **Obstacle 35 (Lanelet 77979.0)**
   - Position: (-348.86151, 624.98506)
   - Velocity: 3.5238 m/s
   - Distance to Ego: Roughly 12.39 meters
   - Also moving ahead, manageable distance given speed change.

3. **Obstacle 310 (Lanelet 77979.0)**
   - Position: (-353.54589, 631.48088)
   - Velocity: 1.7852 m/s
   - Distance to Ego: Roughly 22.30 meters
   - Behind and slower, offering no immediate risk.

4. **Obstacle 331 (Lanelet 77980.0)**
   - Position: (-350.09319, 635.62152)
   - Velocity: 7.7327 m/s
   - Distance to Ego: Around 25.32 meters, moving faster but in a different lane.

5. **Obstacle 338 (Lanelet 78763.0)**
   - Position: (-334.77385, 601.05528)
   - Velocity: 8.9570 m/s
   - Distance to Ego: 14.20 meters away, different lane, not an immediate lateral threat.

6. **Obstacle 348 (Lanelet 78183.0)**
   - Static, located at (-313.14655, 615.83767)
   - Position far (around 29.78 meters behind) and similar lanelet, posing no risk given its stationary state.

### Risk Assessment

- **Potential Collision or Extreme Risk Obstacle**: No obstacle is extremely close to the ego vehicle or significantly reducing the safe distance, indicating no imminent collision or extreme risk scenario in this timestep. 

- **High Risk Assessment**:
  - Obstacle 33 is on the same lanelet, moving relatively close to the ego car, with moderate speed. It's still a manageable risk due to its higher speed but is the closest in lateral positioning and head-to-head trajectory.
  
So, the most significant calculated risk level for any obstacles is 2.
