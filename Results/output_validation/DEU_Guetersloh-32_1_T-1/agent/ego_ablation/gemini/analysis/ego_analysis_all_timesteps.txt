At timestamp 1.5 seconds, the following obstacles are present:

* **Obstacle 33 (Behind):** Located at -0.60m longitudinally and 0.00m laterally.  This obstacle's longitudinal distance is less than 1 meter and closing, presenting a very high risk of collision. The MDC is less than 1 meter, giving a score of 2.  Although the provided data lacks explicit TTC information, given the small MDC and closing velocity, TTC will likely be less than 1.0 second.  This suggests a score of 2 due to the very close proximity and likelihood of imminent collision if the current trajectory is maintained. Overall risk score is therefore 2.

* **Obstacle 35 (Behind):** At -8.50m longitudinally, this obstacle poses no immediate threat.  Its MDC is greater than 5 meters, resulting in a risk score of 5.  TTC cannot be definitively assessed, but with a relatively safe distance, a score of 5 is reasonable.  Overall risk score is 5.

* **Obstacle 310 (Behind):**  At -16.43m longitudinally, this obstacle poses no immediate threat. Risk Score 5.

* **Obstacle 331 (Rear-left):** At -18.49m longitudinally and 2.33m laterally, this obstacle poses no immediate threat. Risk Score 5.

* **Obstacle 338 (Front):** At 10.22m longitudinally, this obstacle is not a high risk at the moment, Risk Score 5.

* **Obstacle 348 (Front-left):**  At 7.16m longitudinally and 25.88m laterally, this obstacle is not a high risk at the moment, Risk Score 5.
