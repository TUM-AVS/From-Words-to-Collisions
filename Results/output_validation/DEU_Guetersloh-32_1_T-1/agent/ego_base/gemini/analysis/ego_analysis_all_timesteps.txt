At t=1.5s:
- **Obstacle 33:** Located behind the ego vehicle at -0.60m longitudinally.  The relative longitudinal velocity is 1.92 m/s, indicating it is approaching the ego vehicle rapidly.  This close proximity and closing speed represent a high risk of collision. Risk score: 2.

- **Obstacle 35:** Located behind the ego vehicle at -8.50m longitudinally with a closing velocity of 1.23 m/s. While approaching, it's not as immediately concerning as Obstacle 33. Risk score: 3.

- **Obstacle 310:** Located behind the ego vehicle at -16.43m and moving away longitudinally at -0.51 m/s. This obstacle poses no immediate risk. Risk score: 5.

- **Obstacle 331:** Located behind and to the left of the ego vehicle at -18.49m longitudinally and 2.33m laterally. Moving away from the ego vehicle. Risk score: 5.

- **Obstacle 338:** Located in front of the ego vehicle at 10.22m and approaching rapidly at -10.71 m/s longitudinally. Given the closing speed, a collision is highly likely in the next few timesteps. Risk score: 1.

- **Obstacle 348:**  Located 7.16m in front and 25.88m to the left, approaching longitudinally at -2.29 m/s, no lateral movement. The distance is relatively close, but lateral distance makes it not an immediate risk. Risk score: 3


Risk Levels:
0: Collision - Physical contact occurred or unavoidable
1: Extreme Risk - Immediate collision likely
2: High Risk - Close to collision, needs quick action
3: Medium Risk - Manageable with proper reaction
4: Low Risk - Minimal risk, sufficient time to react
5: Negligible Risk - No significant risk
