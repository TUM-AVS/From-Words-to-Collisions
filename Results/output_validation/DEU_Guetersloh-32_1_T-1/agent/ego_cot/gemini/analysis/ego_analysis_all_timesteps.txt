### Safety analysis for timestep 1.5s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

Obstacle 31 and 338 are not evaluated as they are not present in the most recent time step.

### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 33**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 33 is extremely close behind the ego vehicle (-0.60m longitudinally).  Lateral distance is also minimal, indicating near overlap with the ego vehicle's rear.
- Distance safety score: 1 (Extreme Risk)
- Time Risk reason: While the longitudinal relative velocity suggests the obstacle is approaching slower than more dangerous scenarios, the proximity represents an extreme risk.  Any slight change in velocity could lead to a collision within the next time step. The small distance, regardless of velocity, necessitates immediate action.
- Time safety score: 1 (Extreme Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 1 (Extreme Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 35**
- Distance Risk reason: Located behind the ego vehicle at -8.50m longitudinally. While not immediately critical, this proximity suggests a potential risk depending on relative velocities and accelerations.
- Distance safety score: 3 (Medium Risk)
- Time Risk reason: The closing longitudinal velocity (1.23 m/s) indicates a decreasing distance between the vehicles. Assuming constant velocity, collision is not imminent but still poses a medium risk if no preventative action is taken
- Time safety score: 3 (Medium Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 3 (Medium Risk)


- **Obstacle ID: 310**
- Distance Risk reason: Situated behind the ego vehicle at -16.43m longitudinally. This distance provides a safety buffer, minimizing risk.
- Distance safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- Time Risk reason: The negative longitudinal velocity (-0.51 m/s) suggests the obstacle is moving further away, mitigating potential collision risk. 
- Time safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 5 (Negligible Risk)


- **Obstacle ID: 331**
- Distance Risk reason: Positioned at -18.49m longitudinally behind the ego vehicle and laterally to the left, creating a significant safety margin.
- Distance safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- Time Risk reason: The significant negative longitudinal relative velocity (-10.02 m/s) confirms the obstacle is moving away from the ego vehicle. The high magnitude emphasizes the minimal collision risk within the foreseeable future.
- Time safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 5 (Negligible Risk)



- **Obstacle ID: 348**
- Distance Risk reason: Located 7.16 meters longitudinally ahead and slightly to the left side of the ego vehicle, introducing a moderate risk given the longitudinal relative motion and the near-term projected path of the obstacle.
- Distance safety score: 3 (Medium Risk)
- Time Risk reason: Longitudinal closing velocity (-2.29 m/s) implies a decreasing distance, raising concern for collision within the next few seconds. Although no lateral motion is observed, focus remains on the immediate longitudinal risk.
- Time safety score: 2 (High Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 2 (High Risk)
