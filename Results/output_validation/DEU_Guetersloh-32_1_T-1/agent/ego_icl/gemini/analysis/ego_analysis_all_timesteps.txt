Obstacle 33: This obstacle is behind the ego vehicle and approaching longitudinally.  The longitudinal distance has been decreasing across all timesteps, reaching -0.60m at the last timestep.  The lateral distance remains at 0.00m, indicating alignment within the same lane. With a positive relative longitudinal velocity (1.92 m/s), a collision is imminent. The negative longitudinal distance (-0.60m) coupled with the approaching velocity suggests that Obstacle 33 has almost completely overlapped the ego vehicle from behind.  This is a critical situation.

TTC (longitudinal): -0.60m / 1.92m/s ≈ -0.31s (Not applicable conceptually due to the negative distance, but flags extremely high risk)
MDC: ≈ 0.60m
Risk: 1 (Extreme Risk) - Approaching rapidly from behind with near-zero distance.

Obstacle 35: Located behind the ego vehicle, showing a decreasing longitudinal distance over time.  At the last timestep, the longitudinal distance is -8.50m and lateral distance is 0.00m (same lane). With a positive relative longitudinal velocity (1.23m/s), it is approaching.

TTC:  -8.50m / 1.23 m/s ≈ -6.91s (negative due to negative distance)
MDC: ≈ 8.50m
Risk: 4 (Low risk given current distance but trajectory warrants monitoring.)

Obstacle 310: This obstacle is behind the ego vehicle. The longitudinal distance is rather stable with -16.43m at the last timestep. At the current velocity -0.51, the risk is small at the moment

TTC (longitudinal): -16.43m / -0.51 m/s ≈ 32.21 (not applicable conceptually, since the obstacle is moving away)
MDC: ≈ 16.43m
Risk: 5 (Negligible Risk)

Obstacle 331:  This obstacle is behind and to the left of the ego vehicle and moving away with a longitudinal distance of -18.49m and a lateral distance of 2.33m. It is moving away from the ego vehicle longitudinally (-10.02 m/s).

TTC (longitudinal): -18.49 / -10.02 ≈ 1.84s
TTC (lateral): 2.33 / 0.29 ≈ 8.03s
MDC: ≈ 18.49m
Risk: 5 (Negligible Risk)

Obstacle 338: Located in front of the ego vehicle, exhibiting a decreasing longitudinal distance across the timesteps.  At the last timestep, the longitudinal distance is 10.22m, lateral distance is 0.00m.

TTC: 10.22m / -10.71 m/s ≈ -0.95s (Not applicable conceptually, extremely high risk)
MDC: ≈ 10.22m
Risk: 3 (Medium risk due to decreasing longitudinal distance)

Obstacle 348: This obstacle is located in front and to the left side of the ego car. Current longitudinal distance is 7.16m, while lateral distance is 25.88m. Longitudinal velocity is -2.29m/s and lateral velocity is -0.00m/s.

TTC (longitudinal): 7.16m / -2.29 m/s ≈ -3.12s
TTC (lateral): Not applicable (No lateral motion)
MDC: ≈ 7.16m
Risk: 4 (Low Risk)
