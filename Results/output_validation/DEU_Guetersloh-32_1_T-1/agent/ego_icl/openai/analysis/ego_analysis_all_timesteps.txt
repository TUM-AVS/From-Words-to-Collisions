## Obstacle Analysis:

### Obstacle 33:
- **Position:** Behind
- **Adjusted Distances:** Longitudinal -0.60m, Lateral 0.00m
- **Relative Velocity:** Longitudinal 1.92 m/s, Lateral 0.03 m/s
- **Motion Description:** Exact lateral alignment; driving toward the ego car from behind.
  
#### Trajectory Analysis:
- Over the timesteps, Obstacle 33 has been consistently approaching the ego vehicle.
- Distance is decreasing with positive relative velocity towards the ego.

#### Risk Calculations:
- **TTC Longitudinal:** | -0.60 m / 1.92 m/s | = 0.31 seconds
- **MDC:** Practically at 0m in longitudinal direction.

#### Risk Assessment:
- The obstacle is extremely close and closing in rapidly.
- **Overall Risk Score:** 1 (Extreme Risk)

### Obstacle 35:
- **Position:** Behind
- **Adjusted Distances:** Longitudinal -8.50m, Lateral 0.00m
- **Relative Velocity:** Longitudinal 1.23 m/s, Lateral -0.10 m/s
- **Motion Description:** Exact lateral alignment; driving toward the ego car from behind.

#### Trajectory Analysis:
- The obstacle is closing in but at a slower rate compared to Obstacle 33.

#### Risk Calculations:
- **TTC Longitudinal:** | -8.50 m / 1.23 m/s | = 6.91 seconds
- **MDC:** 8.50m in the longitudinal direction.

#### Risk Assessment:
- Risk is negligible given the current trajectory and distances.
- **Overall Risk Score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)

### Obstacle 310:
- **Position:** Behind
- **Adjusted Distances:** Longitudinal -16.43m, Lateral 0.00m
- **Relative Velocity:** Longitudinal -0.51 m/s, Lateral -0.07 m/s
- **Motion Description:** Moving away longitudinally; exact lateral alignment.

#### Trajectory Analysis:
- This obstacle is not approaching; it's moving away.

#### Risk Calculations:
- **TTC Longitudinal:** Not applicable as it is moving away.
- **MDC:** Already moving away, negligible risk of collision.

#### Risk Assessment:
- Paths are diverging hence negligible risk.
- **Overall Risk Score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)

### Obstacle 331:
- **Position:** Rear-left
- **Adjusted Distances:** Longitudinal -18.49m, Lateral 2.33m
- **Relative Velocity:** Longitudinal -10.02 m/s, Lateral 0.29 m/s
- **Motion Description:** Moving away both longitudinally and laterally.

#### Trajectory Analysis:
- The obstacle is moving away in both axes.

#### Risk Calculations:
- **TTC Longitudinal:** Not applicable as it is moving away.
- **MDC:** Moving away, no collision risk.

#### Risk Assessment:
- Paths diverging. Negligible risk.
- **Overall Risk Score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)

### Obstacle 338:
- **Position:** Front
- **Adjusted Distances:** Longitudinal 10.22m, Lateral 0.00m
- **Relative Velocity:** Longitudinal -10.71 m/s, Lateral 3.05 m/s
- **Motion Description:** Driving toward ego car longitudinally with exact lateral alignment.

#### Trajectory Analysis:
- Approaching at a high velocity both longitudinally and laterally.

#### Risk Calculations:
- **TTC Longitudinal:** | 10.22 m / 10.71 m/s | = 0.95 seconds
- **MDC:** Approaching trajectory indicates potential close proximity.

#### Risk Assessment:
- High risk due to fast closing longitudinal distance.
- **Overall Risk Score:** 2 (High Risk)

### Obstacle 348:
- **Position:** Front-left
- **Adjusted Distances:** Longitudinal 7.16m, Lateral 25.88m
- **Relative Velocity:** Longitudinal -2.29 m/s, Lateral -0.00 m/s
- **Motion Description:** No lateral relative motion.

#### Trajectory Analysis:
- Approaching slowly, but ample lateral space.

#### Risk Calculations:
- **TTC Longitudinal:** | 7.16 m / 2.29 m/s | = 3.13 seconds
- **MDC:** Sufficient distance in both axes to react.

#### Risk Assessment:
- Low risk due to slower approach and ample lateral space.
- **Overall Risk Score:** 4 (Low Risk)

## Conclusion:

```json
{
    "CollisionObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "33",
        "OverallRiskScore": "0"
    },
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "33",
        "OverallRiskScore": "1"
    },
    "HighRiskObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "338",
        "OverallRiskScore": "2"
    }  
}
```

- Obstacle 33 represents an imminent collision or extreme risk due to close proximity and closing velocity.
- Obstacle 338 poses a high risk due to rapid approach, though sufficient time remains for evasive action.
