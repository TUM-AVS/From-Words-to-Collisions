At t=1.7s, Ego is at (-342.7, 613.0) in lanelet 78281.0.  Let's analyze the closest obstacles:

* **Obstacle 33:** At (-344.9, 617.2) in lanelet 77979.  Positions are close and obstacle 33 shows increasing velocity while Ego is also accelerating, but into a different lanelet. This proximity combined with the velocity difference represents a high risk if Ego were to remain in the same lane. However, given Ego's lane change, the risk is mitigated. Risk score: 3.

* **Obstacle 35:**  At (-348.5, 624.3) in lanelet 77979. Although in the same initial lanelet as Ego, the trajectories diverge as Ego changes lanes, reducing the collision risk. Risk score: 3.

* **Obstacle 310:** At (-353.4, 631.1) in lanelet 77979. This obstacle is further away and poses no immediate threat. Risk score: 4.


Since no obstacle presents a collision or extreme risk at the latest timestep,  IsCollisionScenario is false.

```json
{
  "CollisionObstacles": [],
  "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null,
  "ScenarioAnalysis": {
    "IsCollisionScenario": false,
    "Reasoning": "No obstacle is on a collision course with Ego at the most recent timestep (t=1.7s). Obstacles 33 and 35 were initially close but the risk was mitigated by Ego's lane change."
  }
}
