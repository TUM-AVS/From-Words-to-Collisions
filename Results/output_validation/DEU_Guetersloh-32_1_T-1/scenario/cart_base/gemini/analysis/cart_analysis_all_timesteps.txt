At t=1.7s, Ego is in lanelet 78281.0 and accelerating.

* **Obstacle 33:** Located in lanelet 77979.0, relatively close to Ego and also accelerating.  The trajectories suggest a possible collision if both maintain their current acceleration. Risk score: 1 (Extreme Risk).
* **Obstacle 35:** Located in lanelet 77979.0, also accelerating, and even closer to Ego than Obstacle 33.  High probability of collision if current trends continue. Risk score: 1 (Extreme Risk).
* **Obstacle 310:** Located in lanelet 77979.0. While in the same lanelet as Ego at previous timesteps, Ego has changed lanelets, mitigating the risk. Risk score: 3 (Medium Risk).
* **Obstacle 331:** Located in lanelet 77980.0, and moving away from Ego. No immediate risk. Risk score: 4 (Low Risk).
* **Obstacle 338:** Different lanelet (78763.0), no risk. Risk score: 5 (Negligible Risk).
* **Obstacle 348:** Different lanelet (78183.0), stationary, and far from Ego. No risk. Risk score: 5 (Negligible Risk).

        "Reasoning": "Obstacles 33 and 35 pose extreme risks due to their proximity and acceleration patterns relative to Ego. Obstacle 35 is closer and therefore the primary extreme risk.  While no collision is guaranteed, immediate action is required to avoid a likely collision."
