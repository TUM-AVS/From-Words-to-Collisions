### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. Ego vehicle has changed lanelets (from 77979.0 to 78281.0) and is accelerating.
2. All obstacles are either in different lanelets or moving parallel/away from ego's trajectory.
3. No obstacles show converging paths or immediate collision risk.
4. Historical data shows stable or increasing distances for all obstacles.
5. No obstacles have risk scores â‰¤ 1.
