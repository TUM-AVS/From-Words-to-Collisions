### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep (1.7s): Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

- Obstacle ID: 31.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is in a different lanelet and moving away from the ego vehicle.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason:  Large lateral separation and diverging trajectories.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 33.0
- Distance Risk reason:  Obstacle is in the same lanelet, but sufficiently far behind.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Ego vehicle is accelerating away from the obstacle.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- Obstacle ID: 35.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is in the same lanelet, but sufficiently far behind.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Ego vehicle is accelerating away from the obstacle.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- Obstacle ID: 310.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is in the same lanelet and relatively close behind.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: Ego vehicle is accelerating away from the obstacle.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3

- Obstacle ID: 331.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is in a different, adjacent lanelet and poses minimal risk.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Lateral separation and diverging trajectories.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- Obstacle ID: 338.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is in a different lanelet and moving away from the ego vehicle.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Significant lateral separation and diverging trajectories.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 348.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is in a different lanelet and stationary, posing no immediate threat.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Stationary obstacle, no relative motion.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5


### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
Over the past 0.9 seconds, the ego vehicle has been accelerating while other vehicles in the same lanelet (33, 35, 310) have generally maintained their speeds or accelerated slightly slower. The ego vehicle's increasing velocity combined with the significant lateral distance of other vehicles (31, 338, 348) indicates a low probability of collision.

### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
  "CollisionObstacles": null,
  "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null,
  "ScenarioAnalysis": {
    "IsCollisionScenario": false,
    "Reasoning": "No obstacle poses an immediate collision risk. Ego vehicle is accelerating away from obstacles in the same lanelet, and other obstacles maintain sufficient lateral separation."
  }
