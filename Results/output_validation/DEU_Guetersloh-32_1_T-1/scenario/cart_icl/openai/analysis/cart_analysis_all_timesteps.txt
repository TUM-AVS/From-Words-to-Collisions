### Obstacle Analysis:

1. **Obstacle ID: 31.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason:** This obstacle is moving rapidly away from the ego vehicle with increasing velocity. Despite being in different lanelets, its trajectory is diverging from the ego.
   - **Distance safety score:** 5
   - **Time Risk reason:** The obstacle has consistently increased velocity, moving swiftly away from the trajectory of the ego vehicle.
   - **Time safety score:** 5
   - **Overall Risk score:** 5

2. **Obstacle ID: 33.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason:** Located in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle. The trajectory shows a reduced distance over time as both move in the same direction.
   - **Distance safety score:** 3
   - **Time Risk reason:** Gradual increase in velocity and minimal acceleration could lead to closer proximity in future durations.
   - **Time safety score:** 3
   - **Overall Risk score:** 3

3. **Obstacle ID: 35.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason:** Persistently in close proximity to the ego vehicle in the same lanelet with slightly diverging position.
   - **Distance safety score:** 3
   - **Time Risk reason:** Moderate increase in velocity and acceleration trends suggest controlled movement but potentially closes the gap over time.
   - **Time safety score:** 3
   - **Overall Risk score:** 3

4. **Obstacle ID: 310.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason:** Shares lanelet with the ego and is maintaining a consistent, slightly diverging distance.
   - **Distance safety score:** 4
   - **Time Risk reason:** Moderate velocity and acceleration observed with stable trajectory, suggesting moderate to low risk.
   - **Time safety score:** 4
   - **Overall Risk score:** 4

5. **Obstacle ID: 331.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason:** Not in the immediate lanelet but moving parallel with substantial distance away.
   - **Distance safety score:** 4
   - **Time Risk reason:** Consistent speed and slight acceleration, moving similarly along a parallel path.
   - **Time safety score:** 4
   - **Overall Risk score:** 4

6. **Obstacle ID: 338.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason:** Increasing distance in different lanelet with diverging path from the ego.
   - **Distance safety score:** 5
   - **Time Risk reason:** High and stable velocity, indicating moving safely away.
   - **Time safety score:** 5
   - **Overall Risk score:** 5

7. **Obstacle ID: 348.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason:** Stationary and situated far from the ego's trajectory.
   - **Distance safety score:** 5
   - **Time Risk reason:** No movement detected, posing no time risk.
   - **Time safety score:** 5
   - **Overall Risk score:** 5

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
- The ego vehicle shares a lanelet with obstacles 33.0 and 35.0, which have moderate risk due to their positions and increasing proximity, although they remain manageable with current velocities and observed distances.
- Obstacle 31.0's fast movement away from the ego indicates negligible risk.
- Majority of obstacles either maintain distance or are moving on different trajectories, suggesting no immediate collision risk.
- No obstacle poses a collision or extreme risk, highlighting a scenario that is free from imminent collision danger.
