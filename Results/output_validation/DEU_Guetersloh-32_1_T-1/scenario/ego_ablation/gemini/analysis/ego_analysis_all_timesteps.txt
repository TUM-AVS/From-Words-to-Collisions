Obstacle 33 is very close behind the ego vehicle (-0.18m longitudinally) and moving towards it (1.14 m/s relative longitudinal velocity). This poses an extreme risk of collision.

Obstacle 348 is moderately close to the ego (6.72m longitudinally and 25.87m laterally) with longitudinal motion toward the ego (-3.44 m/s) but no lateral movement, suggesting it's either far away on the side or directly ahead and approaching quickly, thus representing a high risk.
