Obstacle 33 is very close behind the ego vehicle (-0.18m longitudinally) and moving towards it (1.14 m/s relative longitudinal velocity). This represents an extremely high risk of collision.

Obstacle 338 is relatively close in front of the ego (8.07m longitudinally) and closing rapidly (-11.92 m/s relative longitudinal velocity). While not an immediate collision risk, its rapid approach and proximity warrant attention as a high-risk obstacle. If the ego vehicle were to brake suddenly, a collision with Obstacle 338 becomes more likely.

Obstacle 348, while laterally distant (25.87m), is also relatively close longitudinally (6.72m) and approaching the ego vehicle (-3.44 m/s relative longitudinal velocity). The longitudinal distance and velocity suggest a high risk if the ego vehicle were to brake suddenly.


**Risk Levels and Definitions:**
<Collision (Score: 0)>: Actual collision has occurred or is unavoidable within the next timestep.
<Extreme Risk (Score: 1)>: Immediate collision or very high likelihood of impact. Urgent action is required.
<High Risk (Score: 2)>: Close to collision or highly probable collision path. Needs prompt attention and quick manoeuvring.
<Medium Risk (Score: 3)>: Moderate collision risk but manageable with timely reactions and proper strategies.
<Low Risk (Score: 4)>: Minimal collision risk. The situation is controllable with sufficient time to react.
<Negligible Risk (Score: 5)>: No significant collision risk. Obstacles are either moving away or far enough not to interfere.

    "IsCollisionScenario": false,
    "Reasoning": "Obstacle 33 poses an extreme risk due to its close proximity behind the ego vehicle and its movement towards it.  Other obstacles (338 and 348) present high risks due to their longitudinal proximity and closing velocities, especially in case of sudden braking by the ego vehicle."
