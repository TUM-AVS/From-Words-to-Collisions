### Safety analysis for timestep 0.8s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 31
- Distance Risk reason:  Located 13.93m longitudinally and laterally in the front-left. While moving away laterally, it's approaching longitudinally.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Approaching longitudinally at -6.55 m/s with an acceleration of 1.42 m/sÂ². TTClong is approximately 2.13s. Moving away laterally at 15.87 m/s. No lateral collision risk.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- Obstacle ID: 33
- Distance Risk reason: Very close behind the ego vehicle at -2.45m longitudinally and laterally. High risk of rear-end collision.
- Distance safety score: 1
- Time Risk reason: Approaching from behind at 2.21 m/s.  TTClong is approximately -1.11s (already very close). 
- Time safety score: 1
- Overall Risk score: 1

- Obstacle ID: 35
- Distance Risk reason: Behind the ego vehicle at -9.80m longitudinally and laterally.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: Approaching from behind at 1.30 m/s. TTClong is approximately -7.54s.  While the TTC is negative, the distance suggests it's closing in.
- Time safety score: 2
- Overall Risk score: 2

- Obstacle ID: 310
- Distance Risk reason: Behind the ego vehicle at -16.62m longitudinally and laterally.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Approaching slowly from behind at 0.06 m/s.  TTClong is very high. Low risk currently.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- Obstacle ID: 331
- Distance Risk reason:  At -12.60m longitudinally and laterally, moving away from the rear left. 
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Moving away at -8.11 m/s longitudinally. No collision risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 338
- Distance Risk reason: At 16.48m longitudinally and laterally in front.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Approaching at -8.27 m/s longitudinally. TTClong is approximately 2.0s. Lateral velocity suggests it might not be a direct collision course.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3



### Safety analysis for timestep 0.9s - 1.7s: (Analysis Follows the same structure as for 0.8s. Details omitted for brevity. Focus on critical obstacles).

Obstacle 33 consistently poses a high risk throughout the scenario, with the longitudinal distance decreasing. By 1.7s, it's extremely close (-0.18m) and a collision is imminent. Obstacle 348 also becomes a high risk starting from 1.3s and the longitudinal distance gets smaller over time. By 1.7s, it has got very close (6.72 m).


### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
  "CollisionObstacle": {
    "ObstacleID": "33",
    "OverallRiskScore": "0"
  },
  "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {
    "ObstacleID": "348",
    "OverallRiskScore": "1"
  },
  "IsCollisionScenario": true,
  "Justification": "Obstacle 33 shows a very high risk of collision with the ego vehicle from behind, getting extremely close (-0.18m) by 1.7 seconds. Obstacle 348 is approaching ego vehicle quickly from the front left, with the distance rapidly decreasing to 6.72m by 1.7 seconds. While not yet a collision, the rapid closing speed and proximity suggests extremely high collision risk."

Key Observations and Considerations:

* **Lateral Movement:** While some obstacles have lateral movement, the primary concern in this scenario stems from the longitudinal closing distances, especially with obstacles approaching from behind.

* **Accuracy:** The analysis assumes constant velocity and acceleration between time steps. Real-world scenarios involve more complex dynamics, so these calculations are estimations.

* **Scenario Development:** The most crucial aspect is the imminent collision with Obstacle 33. Mitigation strategies in such scenarios might include emergency braking or evasive maneuvers (if feasible and safe).  Careful monitoring of Obstacle 348 is also vital.
