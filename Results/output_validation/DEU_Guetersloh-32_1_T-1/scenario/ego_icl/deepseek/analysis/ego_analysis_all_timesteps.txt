Let me analyze each obstacle at the most recent timestep (1.7 seconds) and determine collision risks:

1. Obstacle 33 (Behind):
   - Longitudinal distance: -0.18m (very close behind)
   - Lateral distance: 0.00m (exact alignment)
   - Relative velocity: 1.14 m/s approaching longitudinally
   - TTC: 0.18/1.14 = 0.16 seconds (Extreme Risk)
   - MDC: 0.18m (Extreme Risk)
   - Risk: 0 (Collision occurring - distance < 0.5m with closing velocity)

2. Obstacle 35 (Behind):
   - Longitudinal distance: -8.22m
   - Lateral distance: 0.00m
   - Relative velocity: 0.45 m/s approaching
   - TTC: 8.22/0.45 = 18.27 seconds (No Risk)
   - MDC: 8.22m (No Risk)
   - Risk: 5

3. Obstacle 310 (Behind):
   - Longitudinal distance: -16.51m
   - Lateral distance: 0.00m
   - Relative velocity: -1.42 m/s (moving away)
   - TTC: N/A (diverging)
   - MDC: 16.51m (No Risk)
   - Risk: 5

4. Obstacle 331 (Rear-left):
   - Longitudinal distance: -20.49m (moving away)
   - Lateral distance: 2.42m (moving away)
   - Risk: 5

5. Obstacle 338 (Front-left):
   - Longitudinal distance: 8.07m
   - Lateral distance: 0.39m
   - Relative velocity: -11.92 m/s (approaching fast)
   - TTC: 8.07/11.92 = 0.68 seconds (High Risk)
   - MDC: 0.39m (Extreme Risk)
   - Risk: 1 (Extreme Risk due to small MDC)

6. Obstacle 348 (Front-left):
   - Longitudinal distance: 6.72m
   - Lateral distance: 25.87m
   - Relative velocity: -3.44 m/s
   - TTC: 6.72/3.44 = 1.95s (Medium Risk)
   - MDC: 25.87m (No Risk)
   - Risk: 3

Trajectory Analysis:
- Obstacle 33 is about to collide with the ego from behind (distance < 0.5m with positive velocity)
- Obstacle 338 is approaching rapidly from front-left with very small lateral distance
- Other obstacles are either moving away or at safe distances
