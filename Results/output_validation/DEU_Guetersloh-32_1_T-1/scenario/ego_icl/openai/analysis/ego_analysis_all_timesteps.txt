### Obstacle-by-Obstacle Analysis:

#### Obstacle 33 (Behind, longitudinal -0.18 m, lateral 0.00 m)
- **Trajectory Analysis:** The obstacle is moving toward the ego vehicle with a longitudinal velocity of 1.14 m/s. The position has been decreasing consistently, indicating a closing situation.
- **TTC Calculation:** TTC_long = -0.18 m / 1.14 m/s ≈ 0.16 seconds (using absolute velocity value)
- **MDC Calculation:** The relative distance is very close in longitudinal dimension, and since the trajectory is converging, MDC is effectively very close to 0.18 m.
- **Risk Score:** With a TTC of 0.16 seconds and MDC of approximately 0.18 m, the risk is classified as Extreme Risk (1).

#### Obstacle 35 (Behind, longitudinal -8.22 m, lateral 0.00 m)
- **Trajectory Analysis:** Approaching the ego vehicle but much slower. The longitudinal velocity is 0.45 m/s.
- **TTC Calculation:** TTC_long = -8.22 m / 0.45 m/s = ~18.27 seconds
- **MDC Calculation:** Decent distance and the trajectory doesn't suggest an immediate collision.
- **Risk Score:** Given this, the risk score is low (4).

#### Obstacle 310 (Behind, longitudinal -16.51 m, lateral 0.00 m)
- **Trajectory Analysis:** This obstacle is moving away from the ego vehicle, given negative velocity.
- **TTC Calculation:** Not applicable as it's moving away.
- **MDC Calculation:** Distance is increasing, so no immediate concern.
- **Risk Score:** No Risk (5)

#### Obstacle 331 (Rear-left, longitudinal -20.49 m, lateral 2.42 m)
- **Trajectory Analysis:** Moving away from ego both longitudinally and laterally.
- **TTC Calculation:** Not applicable as it's moving away.
- **MDC Calculation:** Both distances increasing, indicating lower risk.
- **Risk Score:** No Risk (5)

#### Obstacle 338 (Front-left, longitudinal 8.07 m, lateral 0.39 m)
- **Trajectory Analysis:** It's moving toward the ego with a velocity of 11.92 m/s. The lateral path seems to be diverging.
- **TTC Calculation:** TTC_long = 8.07 m / 11.92 m/s ≈ 0.68 seconds
- **MDC Calculation:** Minimal lateral distance but lateral velocity indicates diverging path.
- **Risk Score:** The conjunction of close longitudinal distance and high relative velocity makes this a High Risk (2).

#### Obstacle 348 (Front-left, longitudinal 6.72 m, lateral 25.87 m)
- **Trajectory Analysis:** Moving toward the ego longitudinally at 3.44 m/s. 
- **TTC Calculation:** TTC_long = 6.72 m / 3.44 m/s ≈ 1.95 seconds
- **MDC Calculation:** Further than necessary for an immediate collision risk.
- **Risk Score:** Medium Risk (3)

### Conclusion
This scenario is identified as a **collision scenario** due to Obstacle 33 with a risk score of 1 (Extreme Risk), specifically due to its very small longitudinal distance and extremely low TTC.
