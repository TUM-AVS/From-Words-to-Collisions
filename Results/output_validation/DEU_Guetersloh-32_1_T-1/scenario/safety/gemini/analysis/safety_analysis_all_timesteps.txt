### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
    - Obstacle ID: 33
    - Relative Direction: Behind
    - Distance Risk Reason:  DTClong is -0.18m, indicating very close proximity behind the ego vehicle. This distance has been decreasing consistently over the timesteps, showing a persistent approach. LatDSC is 5 as the obstacle is directly behind with no lateral offset.
    - Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 0
    - Lateral Distance Safety Score: 5
    - Overall Distance Safety Score: 0.0
    - Time Risk Reason: TTClong is 0.16s, an extremely short time to collision, worsening over time.  TTClat is 0.00s, not applicable in this direct rear approach. 
    - Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 1
    - Lateral Time Safety Score: 0
    - Overall Time Safety Score: 1.0
    - Overall Risk Score: 1

    - Obstacle ID: 35
    - Relative Direction: Behind
    - Distance Risk Reason: DTClong is -8.22m, indicating the obstacle is a safe distance behind the ego vehicle, and has remained relatively steady.  LatDSC is 5 due to direct alignment behind.
    - Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 5
    - Lateral Distance Safety Score: 5
    - Overall Distance Safety Score: 5.0
    - Time Risk Reason: TTClong is 18.30s, indicating ample time to react; it has increased over timesteps. TTClat is not a factor.
    - Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 5
    - Lateral Time Safety Score: 0
    - Overall Time Safety Score: 5.0
    - Overall Risk Score: 5

    - Obstacle ID: 310
    - Relative Direction: Behind
    - Distance Risk Reason: DTClong is -16.51m, a safe distance behind, increasing over time as the obstacle moves further away. No lateral offset (LatDSC = 5).
    - Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 5
    - Lateral Distance Safety Score: 5
    - Overall Distance Safety Score: 5.0
    - Time Risk Reason: TTClong is inf, implying no longitudinal collision risk as the obstacle might be moving away. TTClat is not applicable.
    - Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 5
    - Lateral Time Safety Score: 0
    - Overall Time Safety Score: 5.0
    - Overall Risk Score: 5

    - Obstacle ID: 331
    - Relative Direction: Rear-left
    - Distance Risk Reason: DTClong is -20.49m and DTClat is 2.42m.  Both distances have increased over time, showing the obstacle is moving away.
    - Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 5
    - Lateral Distance Safety Score: 3
    - Overall Distance Safety Score: 4.0
    - Time Risk Reason: Both TTClong and TTClat are inf, indicating no collision risk as the obstacle moves away.
    - Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 5
    - Lateral Time Safety Score: 5
    - Overall Time Safety Score: 5.0
    - Overall Risk Score: 5

    - Obstacle ID: 338
    - Relative Direction: Front-left
    - Distance Risk Reason: DTClong is 8.07m and DTClat is 0.39m.  Longitudinal distance is safe but decreasing. Lateral distance is extremely close and increasing slightly over time.
    - Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 5
    - Lateral Distance Safety Score: 1
    - Overall Distance Safety Score: 3.0
    - Time Risk Reason: TTClong is 0.68s, presenting an immediate risk. TTClat is inf, posing no lateral risk.
    - Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 1
    - Lateral Time Safety Score: 5
    - Overall Time Safety Score: 3.0
    - Overall Risk Score: 3

    - Obstacle ID: 348
    - Relative Direction: Front-left
    - Distance Risk Reason: DTClong is 6.72m and DTClat is 25.87m. The longitudinal distance is safe but decreasing while the lateral distance remains large and poses no immediate risk.
    - Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 5
    - Lateral Distance Safety Score: 5
    - Overall Distance Safety Score: 5.0
    - Time Risk Reason: TTClong is 1.95s, indicating a low risk as there is time to react. TTClat is inf.
    - Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 2
    - Lateral Time Safety Score: 5
    - Overall Time Safety Score: 3.5
    - Overall Risk Score: 4
