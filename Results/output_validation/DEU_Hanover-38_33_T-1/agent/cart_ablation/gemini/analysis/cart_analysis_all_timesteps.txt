Here's the collision risk analysis:

**Ego Vehicle (ID: 30682):** The ego vehicle maintains a consistent trajectory within lanelet 65. Its velocity and acceleration remain relatively stable throughout the provided timeframe.

**Obstacle 30688:** This obstacle is in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle and initially poses a medium risk due to its proximity. However, over the subsequent timesteps, its trajectory diverges slightly from the ego vehicle's path, reducing the risk to low.

**Obstacle 30689:** This obstacle shares the same lanelet as the ego vehicle but its minimum distance from the ego vehicle increase gradually, starting with a relatively close proximity. This behavior makes prediction critical for appropriate reactions over the timesteps. Considering its current trajectory, the risk level is medium, but continuous monitoring is necessary.

**Obstacle 30694:** Located in the adjacent lanelet 64, this obstacle shows no immediate risk of collision. Its trajectory remains distinct from the ego vehicle's, and hence the risk score is negligible. However, it has a very high speed so needs continuous monitoring.

**Obstacle 30696:** Initially located in lanelet 1984, this obstacle changes to lanelet 65 at a later timestep. While it's not in the immediate vicinity of the ego vehicle, monitoring its movement is crucial. As it moves closer to the ego vehicle from behind within the same lanelet, the risk level increases to medium.

**Obstacle 30697:**  This obstacle, located in lanelet 64, demonstrates a consistently safe trajectory, posing no threat to the ego vehicle. Its risk score is negligible.

**Obstacle 30698:**  Residing in lanelet 2083, this obstacle maintains a separate course from the ego vehicle.  Given this consistent trajectory, the risk associated with this obstacle is negligible.

**Obstacle 30700:** In lanelet 63, this obstacle moves at a high velocity, but its position and trajectory make it a negligible risk.  The different lanelets and substantial lateral separation contribute to this low risk.

**Obstacle 30704:**  This obstacle, also in lanelet 63, moves at high speed like 30700. Its location poses no collision risk with the ego vehicle. So risk level is negligible.

**Obstacle 30702:** Situated in lanelet 1984, this obstacle is also moving in other direction. Therefore, I classify this as negligible risk.
