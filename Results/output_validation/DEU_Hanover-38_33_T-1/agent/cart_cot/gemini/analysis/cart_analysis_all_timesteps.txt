Obstacle 30694 shows a concerning trend. While not immediately colliding, its high velocity and acceleration relative to the ego vehicle, combined with its lane change towards the ego vehicle's lane, warrant a high risk assessment.  Obstacle 30688 is also a concern, as its trajectory indicates potential for conflict in the near future.
