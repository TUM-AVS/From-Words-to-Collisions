### Brief Analysis for Risky Obstacles

**Obstacle 30689.0:** At the most recent time step (6.8 seconds), Obstacle 30689.0 is moving along the same lanelet as the Ego vehicle (lanelet 65.0) and has a velocity of 5.7424 m/s. Given its trajectory, it has minimal separation in terms of lateral space relative to the Ego, which is proceeding at a significantly lower speed of 1.6666 m/s, thereby reducing the time to a potential collision. The obstacle's low acceleration (0.2994 m/s²) suggests that without intervention, it may pose a significant threat to the Ego vehicle. 

**Calculation Insight:** Obstacle 30689.0 has a trajectory that converges with the Ego's path in the same lanelet. The obstacle’s relatively higher speed combined with its position indicates that it could collide with the Ego vehicle if it continues on this path without changes to speed or direction.

**Overall Risk Score:** 1 (Extreme Risk)

**Obstacle 30688.0:** This obstacle is also in lanelet 65.0 and exhibits moderate speed and an acceleration pattern that shows a momentary deceleration (compared to its previous acceleration rates). The position and velocity changes suggest it is slightly converging toward the Ego's path, posing a potential high risk due to its location and velocity comparison to the Ego.

**Overall Risk Score:** 2 (High Risk)
