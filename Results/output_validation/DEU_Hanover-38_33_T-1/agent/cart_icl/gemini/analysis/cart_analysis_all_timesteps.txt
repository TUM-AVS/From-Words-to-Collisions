Obstacle 30694 is showing concerning behavior. While it's in a neighboring lanelet (64), its lateral distance to the ego vehicle is decreasing. Combined with a relatively high velocity and acceleration, this warrants close monitoring. The risk level is high, though not yet extreme, as the lateral separation provides some margin.

Obstacle 30688, while in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle, is moving away and doesn't pose an immediate threat. Other obstacles are either in different lanelets with sufficient separation or are moving in a non-concerning manner relative to the ego vehicle.
