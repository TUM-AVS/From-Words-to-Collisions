At timestamp 6.8 seconds, the following obstacles present noteworthy risk:

* **Obstacle 30688 (Behind):** This obstacle is very close longitudinally (-0.88m) and moving towards the ego vehicle. Although lateral movement suggests a possible lane change, the proximity and closing speed warrant a high risk assessment.  The MDC is less than 1 meter, which corresponds to a risk score of 2. The overall risk score is 2 (High Risk).

* **Obstacle 30694 (Front-Left):** While moving away longitudinally (7.24m), the lateral distance of 1.57m and movement towards the ego vehicle warrant a medium risk assessment. There is enough time and distance to react but its proximity to the ego vehicle makes it a potential concern with score of 3.

* **Other Obstacles:** All other obstacles pose low to negligible risk due to larger distances and lateral movements away from the ego vehicle or due to their relative motion and position from the ego vehicle.
