### Safety analysis for timestep 6.8 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

Given that the provided scenario only offers real distances and not the adjusted distances (accounting for vehicle size), I will use real distance for the calculations.  However, in a real-world application, using adjusted distances is crucial for accurate collision risk assessment.  It's important to note that using real distance may underestimate true collision risk, as vehicle size is not factored in.

**Assumptions:**

* For lateral movement, a collision is deemed highly likely if the lateral distance is close to zero and the obstacle is moving towards the ego vehicle laterally. For determining TTC_lat, assuming lateral motion is constant where applicable (though not a highly accurate model) or a very rough estimation based on trajectory trend since we aren't provided exact values for lateral acceleration.
* For longitudinal movement, similar risk assessment is applied for TTC_long and MDC.
* I will assume a simplified model where we can approximate TTC by dividing distance by relative velocity (TTC = Distance / Relative Velocity). This isn't entirely accurate for accelerating objects, but we use it here due to the lack of precise trajectory information.
* For the "Exact lateral alignment or unknown case" description, I will assume a potential lateral risk if the lateral distance is small, favoring safety.



### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 30688**
    - Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is very close behind the ego vehicle (-0.88m longitudinally).  High risk of rear-end collision.
    - Distance safety score: 1
    - Time Risk reason:  Closing quickly from behind.
    - Time safety score: 1
    - Overall Risk score: 1

    - Distance Risk reason: Relatively far ahead (15.81m).
    - Distance safety score: 5
    - Time Risk reason: Moving away longitudinally.
    - Time safety score: 5
    - Overall Risk score: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 30694**
    - Distance Risk reason: Moderately far ahead and to the left (7.24m).
    - Distance safety score: 4
    - Time Risk reason: Moving away longitudinally. Lateral motion towards ego warrants some concern, though current lateral distance offers buffer.
    - Time safety score: 4
    - Overall Risk score: 4


- **Obstacle ID: 30696**
    - Distance Risk reason: Behind the ego vehicle (-13.22m).
    - Distance safety score: 5
    - Time Risk reason: Driving towards the ego car from behind.
    - Time safety score: 4
    - Overall Risk score: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 30697**
    - Distance Risk reason: Behind and to the left (-11.85 m).
    - Distance safety score: 5
    - Time Risk reason: Slowly driving toward the ego car from behind, but the lateral motion is slightly away.
    - Time safety score: 4
    - Overall Risk score: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 30698**
    - Distance Risk reason: Far behind and to the left (-21.51m).
    - Distance safety score: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 30702**
    - Distance Risk reason: Far behind (-25.32m).
    - Distance safety score: 5
    - Time Risk reason: Driving towards from behind.
    - Time safety score: 5
    - Overall Risk score: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 30704**
    - Distance Risk reason: At the same longitudinal position as ego and slightly left. No real distance indicates potential collision.
    - Distance safety score: 0
    - Time Risk reason: Considering its current position, a collision is highly likely.
    - Time safety score: 0
    - Overall Risk score: 0
