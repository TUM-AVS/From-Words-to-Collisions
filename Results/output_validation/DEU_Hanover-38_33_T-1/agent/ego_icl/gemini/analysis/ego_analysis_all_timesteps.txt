* At 6.8 seconds:
    * **Obstacle 30688 (Behind):**  Longitudinal distance is -0.88m and rapidly closing. Lateral distance is 0.00m (same lane). Relative longitudinal velocity is 3.68 m/s. TTC = 0.88 / 3.68 = 0.24s. MDC â‰ˆ 0.88m.  This is extremely high risk due to the very short TTC and close proximity. The obstacle's trajectory over the past 0.9 seconds clearly shows a rapid approach towards the ego vehicle.

    * **Obstacle 30689 (Front):** Longitudinal distance is 15.81m and moving away at 4.06 m/s.  Lateral distance is 0.00m. No risk.

    * **Obstacle 30694 (Front-Left):** Longitudinal distance is 7.24m and moving away. Lateral distance is 1.57m and slightly closing. The lateral motion poses minimal risk given the longitudinal movement. No risk.

    * **Obstacle 30696 (Behind):** Longitudinal distance is -13.22m and closing at 3.37 m/s. Lateral distance is 0.00m. Low risk for now, but needs monitoring.

    * **Obstacle 30697 (Rear-Left):** Longitudinal distance is -11.85m and slightly closing. Lateral distance is 1.45m and moving slightly away. No risk.

    * **Obstacle 30698 (Rear-Left):** Longitudinal distance is -21.51m and slightly closing. Lateral distance is 1.14m and moving slightly away. No risk.

    * **Obstacle 30700 (Front-Left):** Longitudinal distance is 15.39m and moving away. Lateral distance is 4.65m and slightly closing. No risk.

    * **Obstacle 30702 (Behind):** Longitudinal distance is -25.32m and closing at 3.08 m/s.  Lateral distance is 0.00m. Low risk.

    * **Obstacle 30704 (Left):** Longitudinal distance is 0.00m.  Lateral distance is 5.38m and almost static. This indicates the obstacle might be alongside the ego vehicle and slightly moving away. No risk.
