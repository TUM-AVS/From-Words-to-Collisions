### Analysis of the Most Recent Timestep (6.8 seconds)

#### Obstacle 30688
- **Position & Motion:** Obstacle is behind the ego vehicle (adjusted_d_long = -0.88 m, lateral = 0.00 m). It's on the same lateral alignment as the ego car, not yet a collision.
- **Velocity & Acceleration:** Longitudinal velocity is 3.68 m/s towards the ego car, suggesting closing distance. Lateral velocity is 0.74 m/s, moving closer.
- **TTC Calculation:** TTC = 0.88 m / 3.68 m/s ≈ 0.24 seconds (high closing speed, short TTC).
- **MDC Calculation:** Since the obstacle is very close and moving towards the ego vehicle, MDC is effectively 0.88 meters - imminent collision predicted if not mitigated.
- **Risk Assessment:** Extreme Risk present due to short TTC.

#### Obstacle 30689
- **Position & Motion:** In front of the ego vehicle (adjusted_d_long = 15.81 m, lateral = 0.00 m). Moving away.
- **Velocity & Acceleration:** Longitudinal velocity shows moving away from ego at 4.06 m/s.
- **TTC Calculation:** TTC is not applicable as the relative velocity indicates moving apart.
- **MDC Calculation:** Given the divergent motion, substantial MDC.
- **Risk Assessment:** Negligible Risk, the obstacle is moving away.

#### Obstacle 30694
- **Position & Motion:** Front-left (adjusted_d_long = 7.24 m, adjusted_d_lat = 1.57 m).
- **Velocity & Acceleration:** It has a longitudinal velocity of 6.54 m/s and lateral velocity is bringing it closer.
- **TTC Calculation:** Longitudinal TTC = 7.24 m / 6.54 m/s ≈ 1.11 s (approaching to a degree but stable lateral).
- **MDC Calculation:** Not concerning, but moderate approach.
- **Risk Assessment:** Low Risk overall based on stable trajectory.

#### Obstacle 30696
- **Position & Motion:** Behind the ego vehicle (adjusted_d_long = -13.22 m, lateral = 0.00 m).
- **Velocity & Acceleration:** Moving towards with 3.37 m/s.
- **TTC Calculation:** TTC = 13.22 m / 3.37 m/s ≈ 3.92 seconds (adequate time).
- **MDC Calculation:** Also shows manageable trajectory.
- **Risk Assessment:** Low Risk, sufficient time to react.

#### Obstacle 30697
- **Position & Motion:** Rear-left (adjusted_d_long = -11.85 m, adjusted_d_lat = 1.45 m).
- **Velocity & Acceleration:** Slight approach in longitudinal but negligible lateral change.
- **TTC Calculation:** Not effectively applicable due to low closing velocities.
- **Risk Assessment:** Negligible Risk, no significant change in trajectory expected.

#### Obstacle 30698
- **Position & Motion:** Rear-left (adjusted_d_long = -21.51 m, adjusted_d_lat = 1.14 m).
- **Velocity & Acceleration:** Slow net approach, observing lateral withdrawing trends.
- **Risk Assessment:** Negligible Risk, low approach velocity over considerable distance.

#### Obstacle 30700
- **Position & Motion:** Front-left (adjusted_d_long = 15.39 m, adjusted_d_lat = 4.65 m).
- **Velocity & Acceleration:** Moving away with significant velocity in longitudinal direction.
- **Risk Assessment:** Negligible Risk, no confrontation in projected path.

#### Obstacle 30702
- **Position & Motion:** Behind (adjusted_d_long = -25.32 m, lateral = 0.00 m).
- **Velocity & Acceleration:** Approaching longitudinally at 3.08 m/s.
- **TTC Calculation:** Adequate time given its large distance.
- **Risk Assessment:** Negligible Risk, safe distance maintained.

#### Obstacle 30704
- **Position & Motion:** Left, aligned longitudinally (adjusted_d_lat = 5.38 m).
- **Velocity & Acceleration:** Very slightly approaching, longitudinal velocity suggests clearance.
- **Risk Assessment:** Negligible Risk, strong positional safety margins.

The analysis indicates that Obstacle 30688 presents an extreme risk due to the short time-to-collision of approximately 0.24 seconds, suggesting that immediate intervention to change either the ego vehicle’s or the obstacle’s trajectory is necessary to prevent a collision. All other obstacles currently show low or negligible risk profiles, based on calculated distances and velocities.
