At t=7.0s, the ego vehicle at (-143.1272, -26.2849) in lanelet 65 is closest to obstacle 30688 at (-140.7678, -30.3005), also in lanelet 65.  While this obstacle is somewhat close, it's not an immediate collision risk. Other obstacles in the same lanelet (30689, 30696) are farther away and moving in roughly the same direction as the ego vehicle, posing less risk. Obstacles in adjacent lanelets (63 and 64) are also sufficiently far to not be of immediate concern. Obstacle 30685 in lanelet 105 is approaching from a different direction, but the positions and current trajectories don't suggest a high risk of collision in the immediate future.  Since none of the presented obstacles pose a collision or extreme risk (score 0 or 1), the overall scenario is not considered a collision scenario.
