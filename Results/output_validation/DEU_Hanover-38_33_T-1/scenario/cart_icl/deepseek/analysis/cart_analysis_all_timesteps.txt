### Safety Analysis for the Most Recent Timestep (7.0 seconds):

#### Key Observations:
1. **Ego Vehicle**: Moving slowly (~1.67 m/s) with minimal acceleration in lanelet 65.
2. **Obstacles in Same Lanelet (65)**: 30679, 30688, 30689, 30694, 30696, 30697
3. **Critical Obstacles**: 
   - **30688**: Close proximity (-140.77, -30.30) vs ego (-143.13, -26.28), moving at 5.44 m/s with negative acceleration. Converging trajectory over last 10 timesteps.
   - **30689**: (-154.70, -8.57) moving at 5.76 m/s with slight deceleration. Lateral separation decreasing.
   - **30694**: (-153.21, -17.45) moving at 8.09 m/s. High relative speed but lateral distance increasing.

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. **No Collision Detected**: All obstacles maintain safe distances (>3m) at current timestep.
2. **Highest Risk**: 30688 (score 3) due to proximity but diverging trajectory.
3. **Historical Trends**: Most obstacles are either maintaining or increasing distance over time.
4. **Ego Behavior**: Minimal acceleration avoids sudden conflicts.
