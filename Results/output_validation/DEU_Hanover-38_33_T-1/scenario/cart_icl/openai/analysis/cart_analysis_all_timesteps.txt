### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep:
Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

#### Obstacle ID: 30688
- **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is located within the same lanelet as the ego vehicle and is relatively close in terms of lateral position, showing consistent movements within the lane.
- **Distance safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk)
- **Time Risk reason**: The obstacle has a small relative velocity and acceleration towards the ego vehicle, and its movements indicate a potential path crossing, but immediate collision is not imminent.
- **Time safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk)
- **Overall Risk score**: 3 (Medium Risk)

#### Obstacle ID: 30689
- **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is ahead in the same lane with consistent trajectory indicating it is moving away.
- **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
- **Time Risk reason**: The obstacle's velocity is significantly faster than the ego vehicle, and its acceleration indicates strong maintenance of separation.
- **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
- **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low Risk)

#### Obstacle ID: 30694
- **Distance Risk reason**: Positioned in a different lanelet, maintaining a safe distance from the ego vehicle over time.
- **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- **Time Risk reason**: The obstacle's velocity is relatively high but consistently moving away from the ego vehicle with a decreasing approach trajectory.
- **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- **Overall Risk score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)

#### Obstacle ID: 30696
- **Distance Risk reason**: Located in a nearby lanelet with trajectory indicating convergence towards the ego vehicle's lane.
- **Distance safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk)
- **Time Risk reason**: Movement analysis shows acceleration and path suggestive of a potential lane merge, but not immediate risk.
- **Time safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk)
- **Overall Risk score**: 3 (Medium Risk)

#### Obstacle ID: 30697
- **Distance Risk reason**: Positioned in a different lanelet with no significant movement towards the ego vehicle.
- **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
- **Time Risk reason**: The velocity is low, indicating minimal risk of rapid approach.
- **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
- **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low Risk)

#### Obstacle ID: 30698
- **Distance Risk reason**: In a distant position showing no direct trajectory overlap with the ego vehicle's path.
- **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- **Time Risk reason**: Velocity and acceleration indicate stable movements away from the ego vehicle.
- **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- **Overall Risk score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)

#### Obstacle ID: 30700
- **Distance Risk reason**: Although located in a different lanelet, the obstacle is moving at high speed with some trajectory consistency towards the ego vehicle's side.
- **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
- **Time Risk reason**: High velocity indicates a rapid passing trajectory without direct impact risk.
- **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
- **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low Risk)

#### Obstacle ID: 30702
- **Distance Risk reason**: Present in a far lanelet showing consistent movement away from the ego vehicle.
- **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- **Time Risk reason**: There is no significant risk given the lack of trajectory convergence and steady acceleration maintaining separation.
- **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- **Overall Risk score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)

#### Obstacle ID: 30704
- **Distance Risk reason**: Positioned farther away with trajectory maintaining consistent separation from the ego vehicle.
- **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
- **Time Risk reason**: The high-speed velocity and lateral lane position support an analysis where risk is minimized.
- **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- **Overall Risk score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
In analyzing the movements and positions of the obstacles relative to the ego vehicle, none of the obstacles present an immediate or extreme risk of collision. Though some obstacles (like 30688 and 30696) are in medium risk due to proximity and shared lanelet, their overall movements do not indicate an imminent collision scenario. Therefore, the situation is under control with no pronounced collision threat.
