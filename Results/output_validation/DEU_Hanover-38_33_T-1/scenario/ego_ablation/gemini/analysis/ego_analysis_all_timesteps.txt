Obstacle 30688 is behind the ego vehicle and very close longitudinally (-0.13m).  It is approaching the ego vehicle from behind with a longitudinal relative velocity of 3.71 m/s. Although there is some lateral relative velocity (0.83 m/s), the lateral distance is approximately zero, making this obstacle a high risk.

    "IsCollisionScenario": false,
    "Reasoning": "Obstacle 30688 poses an extreme risk of collision due to its close proximity behind the ego vehicle and high longitudinal closing velocity.  While not a collision yet, it is highly likely in the next timestep if no action is taken. Other obstacles are not an immediate threat."
