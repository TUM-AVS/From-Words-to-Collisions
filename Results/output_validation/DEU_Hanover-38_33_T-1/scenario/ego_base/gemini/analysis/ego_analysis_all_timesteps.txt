Obstacle 30688 is behind the ego vehicle and very close longitudinally (-0.13m).  It is approaching the ego vehicle with a relative longitudinal velocity of 3.71 m/s. While the relative lateral velocity is non-zero (0.83 m/s), the obstacle is directly behind the ego, so the lateral movement isn't as significant as the rapidly closing longitudinal distance, making this an extreme risk obstacle.
