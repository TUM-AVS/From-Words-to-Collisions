### Safety analysis for timestep 6.4 - 7.0: The scenarios described for timesteps 6.4 through 7.0 continue the trend observed in the previous timesteps. Obstacle 30688 continues to approach the ego vehicle from behind, posing an increasing collision risk.  Obstacle 30704, having collided with the ego vehicle at timestep 6.3, continues to be reported with 0 distance in the subsequent timesteps, although its relative velocity suggests it's moving past the ego vehicle.  The other obstacles maintain safe distances and trajectories relative to the ego vehicle. Detailed analysis for each obstacle in these timesteps would follow the same pattern as above, with risk assessments based on distance, TTC, and relative motion.  The high risk of collision from Obstacle 30688 requires urgent attention.
