- Overall Risk Score: 1

- Obstacle ID: 30689
- Relative Direction: Front
- Distance Risk Reason: Obstacle is far ahead (16.63m) and moving away.  Presents no risk longitudinally. Lateral distance is zero, representing alignment but not risk due to the large longitudinal distance.
- Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 5
- Lateral Distance Safety Score: 5
- Overall Distance Safety Score: 5
- Time Risk Reason: Longitudinal TTC is inf as it moves away.  Lateral TTC is 0, but irrelevant given the longitudinal motion.
- Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 5
- Lateral Time Safety Score: 0
- Overall Time Safety Score: 5
- Overall Risk Score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 30694

- Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 5
- Lateral Distance Safety Score: 3
- Overall Distance Safety Score: 4
- Time Risk Reason: Longitudinal TTC is inf, showing no longitudinal risk.  Lateral TTC is 4.14s, a moderate value requiring attention.
- Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 5
- Lateral Time Safety Score: 4
- Overall Time Safety Score: 4.5
- Overall Risk Score: 4

- Obstacle ID: 30696
- Relative Direction: Behind
- Distance Risk Reason: The obstacle is approaching longitudinally (-12.53m) and has been consistently doing so over previous timesteps. Lateral distance is zero, implying direct alignment.
- Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 5
- Lateral Distance Safety Score: 0
- Overall Distance Safety Score: 5
- Time Risk Reason:  Longitudinal TTC (3.62s) presents a moderate risk, though not immediately dangerous.  Lateral TTC is 0 due to alignment but not a direct indicator of lateral risk in this case.
- Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 4
- Lateral Time Safety Score: 0
- Overall Time Safety Score: 4
- Overall Risk Score: 4

- Obstacle ID: 30697
- Relative Direction: Rear-left
- Distance Risk Reason: Obstacle is far behind (-11.77m) and moving away laterally (1.45m), posing no risk.
- Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 5
- Lateral Distance Safety Score: 3
- Overall Distance Safety Score: 4
- Time Risk Reason:  Longitudinal TTC (26.44s) and Lateral TTC (inf) confirm no collision risk.
- Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 5
- Lateral Time Safety Score: 5
- Overall Time Safety Score: 5
- Overall Risk Score: 4

- Obstacle ID: 30698
- Relative Direction: Rear-left
- Distance Risk Reason: The obstacle is far behind (-21.42m) and moving away laterally (1.12m). Poses no immediate risk.
- Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 5
- Lateral Distance Safety Score: 3
- Overall Distance Safety Score: 4
- Time Risk Reason: Both longitudinal TTC (50.02s) and lateral TTC (inf) show no risk of collision.
- Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 5

- Overall Time Safety Score: 5
- Overall Risk Score: 4


- Obstacle ID: 30700
- Relative Direction: Front-left
- Distance Risk Reason: Obstacle is moving away longitudinally (16.91m) and laterally towards the ego car (4.57m), but the distances are significant and not indicating immediate danger.
- Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 5
- Lateral Distance Safety Score: 4
- Overall Distance Safety Score: 4.5
- Time Risk Reason:  Longitudinal TTC is inf, showing no risk.  Lateral TTC (8.83s) shows no immediate lateral risk.
- Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 5
- Lateral Time Safety Score: 5
- Overall Time Safety Score: 5
- Overall Risk Score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 30702
- Relative Direction: Behind
- Distance Risk Reason: The obstacle is far behind (-24.68m), posing no immediate risk. Lateral distance is zero, indicating alignment but no immediate lateral risk due to longitudinal separation.
- Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 5
- Lateral Distance Safety Score: 0
- Overall Distance Safety Score: 5
- Time Risk Reason: Longitudinal TTC is high (7.77s), representing no risk.  Lateral TTC is 0, but it does not pose a risk in this scenario because of the large longitudinal distance and longitudinal motion away from the ego vehicle.
- Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 5
- Lateral Time Safety Score: 0
- Overall Time Safety Score: 5
- Overall Risk Score: 5
