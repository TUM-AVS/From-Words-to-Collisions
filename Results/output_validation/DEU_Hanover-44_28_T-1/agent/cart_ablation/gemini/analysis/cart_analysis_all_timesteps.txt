Analysis:

Obstacle 30730: This obstacle is stationary in the same lane as the ego vehicle. The minimum distance between the ego and this obstacle is around 4.5 meters and this distance is increasing in following time steps.  Although the distance is not extremely large, given the stationary nature of the obstacle and the ego vehicle's clearly defined trajectory with speed decreasing gradually ,  a collision is unlikely. The risk level is assessed as 4 (Low Risk).

Obstacle 30733: This obstacle is stationary in a different lane (874) than the ego vehicle (872). Given the ego vehicle's trajectory and the significant lateral separation, there is no immediate risk of collision. This obstacle can be categorized as 5 (Negligible Risk).
