Obstacle 30730: This obstacle is stationary and in the same lane as the ego vehicle.  The ego vehicle is approaching this obstacle, but the distance between them remains relatively constant throughout the provided timesteps.  While the ego vehicle's deceleration might eventually lead to a collision if it continues, within the observed timeframe, the risk isn't immediate or extreme.  I'd classify this as a Medium Risk (3) due to the potential for future collision if the ego vehicle's behavior doesn't change.

Obstacle 30733: This obstacle is stationary and in a different lane (874) than the ego vehicle (872).  The positions remain constant, and there's a significant lateral separation. This obstacle poses a Negligible Risk (5).
