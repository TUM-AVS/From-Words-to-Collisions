In this scenario, at the most recent timestep of 5.5 seconds, the Ego vehicle is at the position (-430.0018, -379.6024) with a decreasing velocity of 3.918 due to negative acceleration. There are two obstacles, 30730.0 and 30733.0, both stationary (velocity = 0.0, acceleration = 0.0) throughout the entire period.

### Analysis:
- **Distance Evaluation**: 
  - **Obstacle 30730.0**: Located at (-432.9627, -384.2309). The Euclidean distance to the Ego vehicle is approximately 5.18 meters. The same lanelet 872 indicates no lateral separation, introducing higher risk.
  - **Obstacle 30733.0**: Located at (-438.8426, -380.4217). The Euclidean distance to the Ego vehicle is approximately 9.85 meters. This obstacle is in a different lanelet (874), suggesting lateral separation.

- **Risk Assessment**:
  - **Obstacle 30730.0** presents a potentially high risk due to proximity and being in the same lanelet, which could lead to a collision if not managed correctly. Therefore, urgent action is recommended to prevent a collision.
  - **Obstacle 30733.0**, while close, does not pose an immediate and direct risk due to its position in a different lanelet, thus reducing the likelihood of a collision.
