At t=5.5s, ego is at (-430.0018, -379.6024) with velocity 3.918 m/s and acceleration -0.1262 m/sÂ².  Obstacle 30730 is stationary at (-432.9627, -384.2309) and obstacle 30733 is stationary at (-438.8426, -380.4217).

**Obstacle 30730:** This obstacle is behind and to the left of the ego vehicle, in the same lanelet.  Since it is stationary and the ego is moving forward, there is no immediate risk of collision. The distance between ego and obstacle 30730 is approximately 5 meters. Risk level: 4

**Obstacle 30733:** This obstacle is ahead and slightly to the left of the ego, in a different lanelet. Since it is stationary and the ego is moving forward, there is a potential risk of collision if the ego continues its trajectory and does not change lanes or decelerate sufficiently. The distance between the ego and obstacle 30733 is approximately 9 meters. The ego's deceleration suggests it may be braking, likely due to the presence of the obstacle. More information is needed about the ego's intended lane changes or future trajectory. Risk level: 3
