To properly assess the risks to the ego vehicle, we will consider the relative position, speed, and lanelet information, focusing primarily on the most recent timestep at 5.5 seconds.

**Timestep Analysis (5.5 seconds):**

- **Ego vehicle (ID: 30732.0)**
  - Position: (-430.0018, -379.6024)
  - Velocity: 3.918 m/s
  - Located in lanelet 872.0

- **Obstacle 30730.0**
  - Position: (-432.9627, -384.2309)
  - Velocity: 0.0 m/s
  - Located in the same lanelet 872.0
  - Relative longitudinal position: ~5.4309 m behind ego
  - Relative longitudinal velocity: -3.918 m/s (ego is moving away)
  - Distance to collision (MDC): ~5.4309 m
  - Risk Assessment: Low risk since the ego is moving away from the obstacle.

- **Obstacle 30733.0**
  - Position: (-438.8426, -380.4217)
  - Velocity: 0.0 m/s
  - Located in a different lanelet 874.0
  - Relative lateral distance: ~8.8408 m
  - Risk Assessment: Negligible risk due to significant lateral separation and different lanelet.

**Risk Conclusion:**

- Obstacle 30730.0: The ego's trajectory suggests it is moving away from the stationary obstacle placed behind it. The risk is considered as low due to adequate MDC and the velocity of the ego vehicle.
- Obstacle 30733.0: Given the substantial lateral distance and lane separation, this obstacle poses negligible risk.

In light of these assessments, no obstacles present a risk score of 0 (Collision) or 1 (Extreme Risk).
