At the most recent timestep (5.5 seconds), Obstacle 30730 poses an extreme risk of collision, and Obstacle 30733 poses a high risk.

**Obstacle 30730 Analysis:**

* **Proximity:** Extremely close (0.99m longitudinally, 0.00m laterally).  The obstacle is almost directly in front of the ego vehicle.
* **MDC:**  0.99m, indicating an Extreme Risk (score 1) due to the very small separation distance.
* **TTC:**  TTC can be approximated by dividing the longitudinal distance by the longitudinal relative velocity: 0.99m / 3.92 m/s ≈ 0.25 seconds. This is an extremely short time, representing an Extreme Risk (score 1).

**Obstacle 30733 Analysis:**

* **Proximity:** Relatively close (0.95m longitudinally, -5.39m laterally). The obstacle is positioned to the front-right of the ego vehicle.
* **MDC:**  The longitudinal distance is the primary concern here as the lateral distance is greater. 0.95m indicates a High Risk (score 2).
* **TTC:** Similar to Obstacle 30730, the TTC is approximately 0.95m / 3.92 m/s ≈ 0.24 seconds. This represents a High Risk (score 2) as it signifies a short time to react before potential collision.
