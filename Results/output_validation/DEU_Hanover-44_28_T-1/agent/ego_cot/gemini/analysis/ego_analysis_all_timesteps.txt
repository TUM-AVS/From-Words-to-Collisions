### Safety analysis for timestep 5.5 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

Given the consistent longitudinal relative velocity (-3.92 m/s) and rapidly decreasing longitudinal distance (0.99m for Obstacle 30730 and 0.95m for Obstacle 30733), a collision is imminent within the next 0.25 seconds (approximately).  Lateral movement is negligible.

**Calculations:**

* **TTClong (Obstacle 30730):** 0.99m / 3.92 m/s ≈ 0.25 seconds
* **TTClong (Obstacle 30733):** 0.95m / 3.92 m/s ≈ 0.24 seconds

### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID:** 30730
- **Distance Risk reason:**  Obstacle 30730 is directly in front of the ego vehicle at a distance of 0.99m, indicating an extremely high risk of collision.
- **Distance safety score:** 1 (Extreme Risk)
- **Time Risk reason:**  TTC is approximately 0.25 seconds, confirming the imminent collision risk.
- **Time safety score:** 1 (Extreme Risk)
- **Overall Risk score:** 1 (Extreme Risk - using the lower of the distance and time scores as the overall score)

- **Obstacle ID:** 30733
- **Distance Risk reason:** Obstacle 30733 is in the front-right of the ego vehicle at a distance of 0.95m, indicating an extremely high risk of collision.
- **Distance safety score:** 1 (Extreme Risk)
- **Time Risk reason:** TTC is approximately 0.24 seconds, confirming the imminent collision risk.
- **Time safety score:** 1 (Extreme Risk)
- **Overall Risk score:** 1 (Extreme Risk)



### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
  "CollisionObstacles": null,
  "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {
    "ObstacleID": "30730", 
    "OverallRiskScore": 1
  },
  "HighRiskObstacle": null
}
```
It's important to note that while the JSON highlights Obstacle 30730, both obstacles present EXTREME risk and a collision is virtually certain in the immediate future without intervention. The selection of 30730 for the "ExtremeRiskObstacle" field is somewhat arbitrary given the nearly identical risk profiles of both obstacles.  A more sophisticated system might flag both as posing extreme risk, but the requested JSON format limits the extreme risk output to a single object.  I have therefore selected 30730 as the primary extreme risk to conform to the specified structure.
