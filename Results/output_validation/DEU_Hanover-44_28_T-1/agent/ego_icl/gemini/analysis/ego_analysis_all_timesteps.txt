**Obstacle 30730:**

* **Trajectory Analysis:** This obstacle has been directly in front of the ego vehicle (lateral distance 0.00m) and steadily approaching over all observed timesteps.  The longitudinal distance has decreased from 4.54m to 0.99m.
* **Longitudinal TTC:** 0.99m / 3.92 m/s = 0.25 seconds
* **Longitudinal MDC:**  0.99m (since lateral distance is 0.00, MDC is the longitudinal distance)
* **Lateral TTC:** Not applicable (lateral velocity is 0.00 m/s)
* **Lateral MDC:** 0.00m
* **Risk Assessment:**  Both TTC (0.25s) and MDC (0.99m) indicate Extreme Risk (1). The consistent approach trajectory and very short distance confirm this high risk.

**Obstacle 30733:**

* **Trajectory Analysis:** This obstacle has been to the front-right of the ego vehicle, maintaining a roughly constant lateral distance of around -5.4 meters while approaching longitudinally. The longitudinal distance has decreased from 4.49m to 0.95m.
* **Longitudinal TTC:** 0.95 m / 3.92 m/s = 0.24 seconds
* **Longitudinal MDC:** 0.95m
* **Lateral TTC:** Not applicable (lateral velocity is 0 m/s)
* **Lateral MDC:** 5.39m (absolute value used)
* **Risk Assessment:** The longitudinal TTC (0.24s) suggests an Extreme Risk(1). While lateral distance is significant, the rapidly closing longitudinal distance takes precedence in this diagonal approach.
