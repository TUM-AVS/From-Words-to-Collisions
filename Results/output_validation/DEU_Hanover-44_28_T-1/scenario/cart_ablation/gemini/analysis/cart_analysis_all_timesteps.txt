At t=5.7s, the ego vehicle at (-430.4244, -380.2619) in lanelet 872 is closest to obstacle 30730 at (-432.9627, -384.2309), also in lanelet 872.  While the ego vehicle is decelerating significantly (-0.9316 m/sÂ²), it's still moving at a substantial speed (3.7841 m/s). Obstacle 30730 is stationary. The distance between them is approximately 4.2 meters. Given the ego vehicle's deceleration and current velocity, a collision is not imminent in the very next timestep, but the risk is extremely high if the ego continues to decelerate at a similar rate in that lane.

Obstacle 30733 at (-438.8426, -380.4217) is in a different lanelet (874), and poses no immediate risk.
