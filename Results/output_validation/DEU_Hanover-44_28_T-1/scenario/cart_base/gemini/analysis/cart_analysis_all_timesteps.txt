At t=5.7s, Ego is in lanelet 872 and rapidly decelerating (-0.9316 m/sÂ²).

Obstacle 30730 is stationary in the same lanelet (872) as Ego.  Given Ego's position (-430.4244, -380.2619) and Obstacle 30730's position (-432.9627, -384.2309), they are close.  The rapid deceleration of Ego suggests a possible emergency braking maneuver to avoid Obstacle 30730. While not colliding in this timestep, the sharp deceleration and proximity suggest an extremely high risk of imminent collision.

Obstacle 30733 is stationary in lanelet 874 and poses no immediate risk.
