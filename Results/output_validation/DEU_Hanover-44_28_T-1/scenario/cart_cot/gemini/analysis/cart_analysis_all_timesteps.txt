### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 30730.0
- Distance Risk reason: This obstacle is in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle and relatively close.  While not immediately colliding, the distance has remained fairly consistent throughout the provided timesteps, indicating a potential for collision if the ego vehicle were to decelerate significantly or the obstacle were to unexpectedly accelerate. The Y-coordinate difference is larger than the X-coordinate difference, suggesting some lateral separation, which reduces the immediate risk.
- Distance safety score: 2
- Time Risk reason: The obstacle is stationary, while the ego vehicle is moving at a moderate speed. This presents a medium risk as any continued motion by the ego vehicle directly towards the obstacle could result in a collision.  While the ego vehicle shows slight deceleration over several timesteps, followed by stronger deceleration in the final timesteps, it's still approaching the obstacle.
- Time safety score: 2
- Overall Risk score: 2

- Obstacle ID: 30733.0
- Distance Risk reason: This obstacle is in a different lanelet than the ego vehicle. Although the X and Y separations are not very large, the different lanelets suggest a designated path for each vehicle, thus reducing the risk of collision. The data shows consistently maintained separation over all timesteps.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Both the ego vehicle and the obstacle are in their respective lanelets and maintain those throughout the provided timesteps, showing no sign of converging. The obstacle is stationary, and the ego vehicle's motion, even with its deceleration, doesn't suggest any immediate convergence.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4


### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. **Most critical obstacle:** Obstacle 30730.0 poses the most immediate risk due to its proximity to the ego vehicle and its presence within the same lane.

2. **Trajectory Analysis (10 timesteps):**  The ego vehicle is moving towards Obstacle 30730.0 while decelerating. Obstacle 30730.0 is stationary throughout the entire duration. Obstacle 30733.0 is also stationary and in a different lane, presenting less of a concern.

3. **Relative Positions, Velocities, and Accelerations:** The ego vehicle's deceleration lowers the risk compared to constant velocity, but itâ€™s not sufficient to prevent a collision if it maintains its current path. The obstacle's static nature increases the collision risk if the ego's trajectory isn't corrected.

4. **Collision Determination:**  While no collision has occurred within the provided timeframe, a collision is probable if the ego vehicle does not significantly change its path or decelerate substantially more. The ego vehicle continues to approach the obstacle even as its braking increases.

5. **Reasoning:** The consistent approach of the ego towards a stationary obstacle in the same lane, despite deceleration, creates a likely collision scenario if the ego vehicle does not take immediate corrective action.
