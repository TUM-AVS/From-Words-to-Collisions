### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep (5.7 seconds):

### Obstacle Analysis:
1. **Obstacle ID: 30730.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Static obstacle in the same lanelet (872.0) as ego. Distance is ~3.9m and decreasing slightly over time.
   - **Distance safety score**: 2 (High Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: Ego is decelerating (-0.9316 m/sÂ²), but obstacle is static. TTC is ~10.3s (distance/relative velocity).
   - **Time safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 2 (High Risk)

2. **Obstacle ID: 30731.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Moving away from ego in lanelet 581.0. Distance is ~112m and increasing over time.
   - **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: Relative velocity is high (ego ~3.78 m/s, obstacle ~13.50 m/s away). No collision risk.
   - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)

3. **Obstacle ID: 30733.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Static obstacle in adjacent lanelet (874.0). Distance is ~10.2m and stable.
   - **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: No relative motion (obstacle is static). Ego is decelerating.
   - **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low Risk)

4. **Obstacle ID: 30734.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Moving away in lanelet 901.0. Distance is ~55m and increasing.
   - **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: Relative velocity is high (ego ~3.78 m/s, obstacle ~7.40 m/s away).
   - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. No obstacles are on a direct collision course with ego.
2. Obstacle 30730.0 is the closest but is static, and ego is decelerating.
3. Other obstacles are either moving away or in non-conflicting lanes.
4. No immediate collision risk detected.
