### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 30730.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is in the same lanelet as ego and relatively close.  Historical data shows it is stationary.
- Distance safety score: 2
- Time Risk reason: Ego is approaching the stationary obstacle.  Deceleration of ego from t=5.3 to t=5.7 suggests braking, but still a risk.
- Time safety score: 2
- Overall Risk score: 2

- Obstacle ID: 30733.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is in a different lanelet and poses no immediate threat based on current and past trajectories.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Obstacle is stationary and poses no time-dependent risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. At t=5.7, ego vehicle is still moving towards the stationary obstacle 30730.0, which is in the same lane.
2. Ego vehicle is decelerating, but current position and velocity suggest a likely collision if deceleration is not sufficient.
3. Obstacle 30733.0 is not a risk as it's in a different lane and stationary.
4. Conclusion: This is not a collision scenario yet, but it's highly probable without further deceleration.
