### Obstacle Analysis:

#### Obstacle ID: 30730.0
- **Distance Risk Reason**: Obstacle 30730 is within the same lanelet as the Ego vehicle. Over the past timesteps, its position has remained constant while the Ego vehicle approaches. As of the most recent timestep, the closest recorded position difference is approximately 4.5 units. This indicates a proximity requiring attention but not immediate collision.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 2 (High Risk)

- **Time Risk Reason**: With a constant velocity of 0.0 for the obstacle, the relative velocity is entirely due to the Ego vehicle's speed. Considering the vehicle's velocity trends, the time to collision (TTC) is around 1.14 seconds without any deceleration. However, Ego vehicle is decelerating, reducing the risk over time.
- **Time Safety Score**: 3 (Medium Risk)

- **Overall Risk Score**: 2 (High Risk)

#### Obstacle ID: 30733.0
- **Distance Risk Reason**: Obstacle 30733 is positioned in a different lanelet than the Ego vehicle, maintaining a constant distance without lateral movement into the Ego's trajectory. With a relatively stable distance of over 8 units, there is minimal immediate risk.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)

- **Time Risk Reason**: This obstacle has also been stationary. The distance ensures that relative velocity effects are negligible for risk. There is no imminent threat posed by this obstacle.
- **Time Safety Score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)

- **Overall Risk Score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
Given the behavior of obstacles, there is no evidence of an imminent collision scenario. Obstacle 30730 poses a higher risk due to proximity but not enough to classify as extreme. The Ego vehicle's ability to slow down and change lanes would manage the risk effectively.
