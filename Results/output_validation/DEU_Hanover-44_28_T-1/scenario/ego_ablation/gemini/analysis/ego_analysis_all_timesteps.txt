Obstacle 30730 shows extremely dangerous proximity to the ego vehicle at the most recent timestep (5.7 seconds).  The longitudinal distance is a mere 0.20 meters, indicating a near-certain collision if the current trajectories are maintained. The relative longitudinal velocity of -3.78 m/s further confirms the rapid closing of the distance.  Obstacle 30733, while not as immediately critical as 30730, still presents a high risk. It's located 0.17 meters longitudinally and 5.39 meters laterally from the ego, with the same high closing velocity as 30730. This lateral distance might be just enough to avoid a collision depending on the ego and obstacle dimensions. The very small longitudinal distances and high negative relative velocities suggest a likely imminent collision.

    "Reasoning": "Obstacle 30730 is at a longitudinal distance of 0.20m and approaching with negative velocity indicating an unavoidable collision. Obstacle 30733 also shows high risk with a close longitudinal distance of 0.17m, though its lateral offset might prevent direct impact.  The scenario is classified as a collision due to the imminent impact with obstacle 30730."
