At t=5.7s, obstacle 30730 is directly in front of the ego vehicle at a distance of 0.20m with a closing velocity of -3.78 m/s.  This is extremely close and represents an unavoidable collision in the next timestep. Obstacle 30733 is also very close at 0.17m, but laterally offset by -5.39m.  While also close, the primary concern is the imminent collision with obstacle 30730.

**Risk Levels and Definitions:**
<Collision (Score: 0)>: Actual collision has occurred or is unavoidable within the next timestep.
<Extreme Risk (Score: 1)>: Immediate collision or very high likelihood of impact. Urgent action is required.
<High Risk (Score: 2)>: Close to collision or highly probable collision path. Needs prompt attention and quick manoeuvring.
<Medium Risk (Score: 3)>: Moderate collision risk but manageable with timely reactions and proper strategies.
<Low Risk (Score: 4)>: Minimal collision risk. The situation is controllable with sufficient time to react.
<Negligible Risk (Score: 5)>: No significant collision risk. Obstacles are either moving away or far enough not to interfere.
