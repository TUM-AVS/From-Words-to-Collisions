### Safety analysis for timestep 4.8s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 30730
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 30730 is in front of the ego vehicle with a longitudinal distance of 3.75m and a lateral distance of 3.75m.  The relative longitudinal velocity is negative, indicating the obstacle is moving towards the ego vehicle.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: The TTClong is approximately 0.95 seconds (3.75m / 3.96m/s).  This is a very short time to collision.
- Time safety score: 2
- Overall Risk score: 2

- Obstacle ID: 30733
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 30733 is in the front-right of the ego vehicle with a longitudinal distance of 3.70m and a lateral distance of 3.70m. The relative longitudinal velocity is negative, indicating the obstacle is moving towards the ego vehicle.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: The TTClong is approximately 0.94 seconds (3.70m / 3.96m/s). This is a very short time to collision.
- Time safety score: 2
- Overall Risk score: 2


### Safety analysis for timestep 4.9s - 5.6s:
(Calculations and analysis similar to 4.8s, with distances and TTC decreasing. Risk scores would progressively decrease from 2 towards 1 as the ego vehicle gets closer to the obstacles. At 5.6s, TTC is ~0.15s)


### Safety analysis for timestep 5.7s:
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 30730
- Distance Risk reason: The obstacle is extremely close (0.20m longitudinally and laterally) and in front of the ego vehicle.
- Distance safety score: 1
- Time Risk reason: The TTClong is critically low at approximately 0.05 seconds (0.20m / 3.78m/s).
- Time safety score: 1
- Overall Risk score: 1

- Obstacle ID: 30733
- Distance Risk reason: The obstacle is extremely close (0.17m longitudinally and laterally) and in the front-right of the ego vehicle.
- Distance safety score: 1
- Time Risk reason: The TTClong is critically low at approximately 0.04 seconds (0.17m / 3.78m/s).
- Time safety score: 1
- Overall Risk score: 1



### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
  "CollisionObstacle": null,
  "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {
    "ObstacleID": ["30730", "30733"],
    "OverallRiskScore": "1"
  },
  "IsCollisionScenario": false, 
  "Justification": "At the final timestamp (5.7s), both obstacles are extremely close to the ego vehicle with exceptionally low TTC values, indicating extreme risk. Although the data doesn't definitively show a collision, the likelihood is incredibly high if no evasive action is taken. Therefore, it's classified as an extreme risk scenario."
