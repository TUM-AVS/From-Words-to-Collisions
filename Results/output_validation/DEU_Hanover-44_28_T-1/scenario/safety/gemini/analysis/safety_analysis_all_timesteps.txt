### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
    - Obstacle ID: 30730
    - Relative Direction: Front
    - Distance Risk Reason: DTClong is 0.20m, indicating extreme risk. The obstacle has consistently approached the ego vehicle over the past 10 timesteps, with DTClong decreasing steadily.  DTClat is 0.00m, posing no lateral risk as the obstacle remains directly ahead.
    - Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 1
    - Lateral Distance Safety Score: 5
    - Overall Distance Safety Score: 1.0 * 1 + (1 - 1.0) * 5 = 1.0
    - Time Risk Reason: TTClong is 0.05s, indicating extreme risk of longitudinal collision. TTC has decreased steadily across all timesteps, signifying imminent collision. TTClat is 0.00s, further confirming the direct front collision course.
    - Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 1
    - Lateral Time Safety Score: 0
    - Overall Time Safety Score: 1.0 * 1 + (1 - 1.0) * 0 = 1.0
    - Overall Risk Score: 1

    - Obstacle ID: 30733
    - Relative Direction: Front-right
    - Distance Risk Reason: DTClong is 0.17m, indicating extreme risk. The obstacle is very close longitudinally and has consistently approached the ego vehicle over the past 10 timesteps. DTClat is -5.39m, implying no lateral collision risk in the most recent timestep although the relative lateral distance remains nearly constant throughout. 
    - Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 1
    - Lateral Distance Safety Score: 5
    - Overall Distance Safety Score: 0.5 * 1 + (1 - 0.5) * 5 = 3.0
    - Time Risk Reason: TTClong is 0.04s, indicating extreme risk. The obstacle's TTClong has consistently decreased across all timesteps.  TTClat is inf, indicating no lateral collision risk.
    - Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 1
    - Lateral Time Safety Score: 5
    - Overall Time Safety Score: 0.5 * 1 + (1 - 0.5) * 5 = 3.0
    - Overall Risk Score: 3
