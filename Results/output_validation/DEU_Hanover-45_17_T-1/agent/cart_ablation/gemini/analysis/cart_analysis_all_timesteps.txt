Analysis:

Both Ego and Obstacle 30700 are in the same lanelet (596.0).  Over the provided time steps, the obstacle's x-coordinate is consistently decreasing its distance from the ego vehicle's x-coordinate. The y-coordinates also show the vehicles are moving closer together, although more gradually than the change in x values. The obstacle's velocity is consistently higher than the ego vehicle's velocity. The obstacle vehicle's acceleration oscillates yet remains positive. Although there is no collision in the observed timeframes, the continuously decreasing distance, combined with the velocity differences and unpredictable acceleration of the obstacle, indicates a potential future collision if these trends continue. Given the current trajectories and velocities, a collision is increasingly likely within the next few seconds. Thus, I classify obstacle 30700 as presenting an Extreme Risk (1).
