The ego vehicle and obstacle 30700 are in the same lanelet (596.0).  Analyzing the provided data, the lateral distance between the ego and the obstacle remains relatively constant, but the longitudinal distance is decreasing.  While the obstacle's velocity is initially higher than the ego's, both vehicles are decelerating. The obstacle's deceleration is inconsistent though, oscillating between positive and negative values. This makes predicting its future behavior and precise collision risk difficult solely based on the provided 1-second snapshots.

However, based on the shrinking longitudinal distance and the relatively small lateral distance, a collision is possible within a short timeframe if the obstacle continues its overall deceleration trend and the ego maintains its course. Although a collision isn't imminent in the next immediate time step, the closing distance necessitates classifying the obstacle as a high risk.
