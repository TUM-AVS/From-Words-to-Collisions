At t=7.5s, the ego vehicle is at (405.7125, -80.3602) with a velocity of 5.739 m/s and the obstacle 30700.0 is at (404.1045, -75.5338) with a velocity of 8.3216 m/s. Both are in the same lanelet (596.0).  The obstacle is ahead and slightly to the left of the ego vehicle, but the x-coordinates are converging. The y-coordinate difference suggests a lane change might be in progress by the obstacle or that the vehicles aren't perfectly aligned within the lane.

Over the past few timesteps, the obstacle's velocity has fluctuated, indicating some instability in its motion.  The ego vehicle has maintained a relatively constant velocity and deceleration.

While a precise TTC calculation is difficult without detailed trajectories, the closing x-coordinate values combined with the y-coordinate offset suggests an increasing risk if these trends continue. It's unlikely to be an immediate collision (risk 0 or 1) given the current separation, but requires monitoring. We assign a risk score of 2 (High Risk) given the possibility of a lane change or unexpected maneuver from the obstacle, and the close proximity in the x-direction within the same lanelet. More data is needed for accurate TTC/MDC.
