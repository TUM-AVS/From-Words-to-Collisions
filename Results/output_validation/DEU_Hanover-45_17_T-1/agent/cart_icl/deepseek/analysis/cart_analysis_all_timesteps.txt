### Analysis:

1. **Relative Motion and Trajectory**:
   - Both the ego vehicle (ID: 30697) and the obstacle (ID: 30700) are in the same lanelet (596.0) and have similar orientations (~-1.248 rad), indicating they are moving in the same direction.
   - The obstacle is ahead of the ego vehicle and moving faster (obstacle velocity: ~8.32 m/s vs. ego velocity: ~5.74 m/s). The relative longitudinal velocity is ~2.58 m/s (obstacle is pulling away).

2. **Distance and TTC**:
   - At the most recent timestep (7.5s):
     - Ego position: (405.7125, -80.3602)
     - Obstacle position: (404.1045, -75.5338)
     - Longitudinal distance: ~4.83 m (obstacle ahead)
     - Lateral distance: ~4.83 m (since they are in the same lane, lateral distance is negligible for collision risk).
     - TTC: Longitudinal distance / relative velocity = 4.83 / 2.58 ≈ 1.87 s (not imminent, as the obstacle is pulling away).

3. **Acceleration Trends**:
   - The ego vehicle is decelerating (acceleration: ~-0.02 m/s²), while the obstacle's acceleration fluctuates but is generally negative (decelerating). The relative acceleration is not significant enough to cause an imminent collision.

4. **Risk Assessment**:
   - The obstacle is ahead and pulling away, with a TTC of ~1.87 s. The lateral distance is negligible (same lane). The risk is **Low (4)** as there is no immediate danger.
