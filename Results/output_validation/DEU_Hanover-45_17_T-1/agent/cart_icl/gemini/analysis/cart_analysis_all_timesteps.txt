At t=7.5s, the ego vehicle is at (405.7125, -80.3602) with a velocity of 5.739 m/s and the obstacle 30700 is at (404.1045, -75.5338) with a velocity of 8.3216 m/s. Both are in the same lanelet (596).

The obstacle is slightly behind the ego vehicle in the x-direction (longitudinal) but significantly to its right in the y-direction (lateral).  The obstacle's greater velocity suggests it might overtake the ego vehicle.  However, the lateral separation and the consistent orientations suggest the obstacle is likely in an adjacent lane and not on a direct collision course.

Calculating a precise TTC is challenging without accurate heading information (needed to decompose velocities). However, based on the provided data and observed trends, a collision appears unlikely in the immediate future.  The risk level will be assessed as Medium (3) due to the relatively close proximity and differing velocities, requiring monitoring.
