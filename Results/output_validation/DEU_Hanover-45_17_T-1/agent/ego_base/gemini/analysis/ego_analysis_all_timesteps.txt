At t=7.5s, obstacle 30700 is behind the ego vehicle with a longitudinal distance of -0.58m and a lateral distance of 0.00m.  It is approaching the ego vehicle at a longitudinal relative velocity of 2.58 m/s.  The negative longitudinal distance indicates the obstacle is very close to the rear of the ego vehicle.  Given the closing velocity, a collision is imminent in the next few timesteps if the obstacle and ego vehicle maintain their current trajectories and velocities. This qualifies as an extreme risk.

Risk Levels:
0: Collision - Physical contact occurred or unavoidable
1: Extreme Risk - Immediate collision likely
2: High Risk - Close to collision, needs quick action
3: Medium Risk - Manageable with proper reaction
4: Low Risk - Minimal risk, sufficient time to react
5: Negligible Risk - No significant risk
