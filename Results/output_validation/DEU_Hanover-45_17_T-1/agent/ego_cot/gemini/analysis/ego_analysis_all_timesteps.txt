### Safety analysis for timestep 7.5s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

**Calculations and Assumptions:**

Since the lateral distance and velocity are almost identical to the longitudinal values and the obstacle is approaching from behind, we can simplify the analysis by focusing primarily on the longitudinal component. We'll assume a worst-case scenario where lateral movement doesn't significantly alter the risk.  We will directly use the provided longitudinal distances as a proxy for MDC since vehicle dimensions weren't explicitly provided.  TTC will be a simple linear estimation based on closing velocity.

**Obstacle Analysis:**

- **Obstacle ID:** 30700
- **Distance Risk reason:**  At 7.5 seconds, the obstacle is -0.58m behind the ego vehicle longitudinally. This extremely close proximity indicates a very high risk of collision.
- **Distance safety score:** 1 (Extreme Risk)
- **Time Risk reason:**  With a closing velocity of approximately 2.58 m/s and a distance of -0.58m, a very short time to collision is expected (TTC ~= 0.58m / 2.58 m/s ~= 0.22 seconds).
- **Time safety score:** 1 (Extreme Risk)
- **Overall Risk score:** 1 (Extreme Risk - The combination of very close proximity and high closing velocity leads to a high likelihood of imminent collision.)
