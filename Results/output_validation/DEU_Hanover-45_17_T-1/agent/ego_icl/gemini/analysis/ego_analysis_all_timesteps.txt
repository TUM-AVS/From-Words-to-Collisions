Obstacle 30700 is behind the ego vehicle and approaching rapidly.  The longitudinal distance has been steadily decreasing across the provided timesteps, from -2.89m to -0.58m in the last timestep.  The lateral distance remains at 0.00m, indicating the obstacle is directly behind and in the same lane as the ego vehicle. The relative longitudinal velocity is consistently around 2.55 m/s - 2.60 m/s showing persistent closing speed.

Given the longitudinal distance of -0.58m and a relative velocity of 2.58 m/s, the TTC is calculated as 0.58/2.58 = 0.22 seconds. The MDC is 0.58m. Both values indicate an *extreme* risk of collision.
