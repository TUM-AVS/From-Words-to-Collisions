**Obstacle Analysis**

### Obstacle 30700

#### Trajectory Analysis:
- **6.6 seconds:** Longitudinal distance from ego: -2.89m, relative velocity: 2.55 m/s (approaching the ego from behind)
- **6.7 seconds:** Longitudinal distance: -2.63m, relative velocity: 2.60 m/s
- **6.8 seconds:** Longitudinal distance: -2.37m, relative velocity: 2.59 m/s
- **6.9 seconds:** Longitudinal distance: -2.12m, relative velocity: 2.54 m/s
- **7.0 seconds:** Longitudinal distance: -1.86m, relative velocity: 2.54 m/s
- **7.1 seconds:** Longitudinal distance: -1.61m, relative velocity: 2.58 m/s
- **7.2 seconds:** Longitudinal distance: -1.35m, relative velocity: 2.60 m/s
- **7.3 seconds:** Longitudinal distance: -1.10m, relative velocity: 2.56 m/s
- **7.4 seconds:** Longitudinal distance: -0.84m, relative velocity: 2.60 m/s
- **7.5 seconds (most recent):** Longitudinal distance: -0.58m, relative velocity: 2.58 m/s

#### Calculations:
- **TTC Calculation:**
  - TTC = Distance / |Relative Velocity|
  - At 7.5 seconds: TTC = 0.58m / 2.58 m/s â‰ˆ 0.225 seconds

- **MDC Considerations:**
  - Current longitudinal distance is -0.58 meters.
  - With exact alignment and rapidly decreasing distance, the problem is mainly longitudinal.
  - The obstacle's trajectory indicates a continuous approach with no discernible lateral movement that affects risk, aligning with the motion description of exact lateral alignment.

#### Risk Assessment:
- **Time-to-Collision (TTC):** 0.225 seconds indicates an imminent collision.
- **Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC):** -0.58 meters, suggests near-collision conditions.
- **Risk Level:**
  - With an approaching velocity and a TTC < 0.5 seconds, the risk level is classified as Extreme Risk, indicating an immediate action is necessary to avoid collision.

### JSON Output:
```json
{
  "CollisionObstacle": {
    "ObstacleID": "30700",
    "OverallRiskScore": "0"
  },
  "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {
    "ObstacleID": "",
    "OverallRiskScore": ""
  },
  "HighRiskObstacle": {

**Note:**
Given the exact lateral alignment and rapidly closing longitudinal distance, obstacle 30700 is at imminent risk of collision at the most recent timestamp, hence classified under "CollisionObstacle".
