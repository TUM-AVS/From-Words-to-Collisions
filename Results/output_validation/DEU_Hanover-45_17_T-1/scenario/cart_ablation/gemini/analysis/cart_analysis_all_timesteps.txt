At t=7.7s, the ego vehicle is at (406.0761, -81.4489) and the obstacle (ID 30700.0) is at (404.63, -77.1085).  Both are in the same lanelet (596.0). The distance between them is approximately 4.6 meters.  While the obstacle's velocity (8.3082 m/s) is higher than the ego vehicle's (5.7321 m/s), the obstacle's fluctuating acceleration suggests inconsistent behavior but at the last timestep is decelerating (-0.3282 m/sÂ²).

Given the current distance and the rate of closure, a collision is not imminent in the very next timestep, though the rapidly changing acceleration of the obstacle vehicle introduces uncertainty. Thus, I classify this as a high risk (2), not extreme risk (1), because of the separation distance, and not medium (3) because of the unpredictable nature of the leading obstacle's behavior.
