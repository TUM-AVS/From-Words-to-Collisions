At t=7.7s, the ego vehicle at (406.0761, -81.4489) and the obstacle 30700.0 at (404.63, -77.1085) are in the same lanelet (596.0). The obstacle is approximately 4.4 meters away longitudinally and about 4.3 meters away laterally. While the lateral distance might seem significant, both vehicles are moving in a generally parallel direction (similar orientations of ~-1.25 radians), and the obstacle's higher velocity (8.3082 vs ego's 5.7321) suggests it is closing the longitudinal gap. Although the data fluctuates, the overall trend shows a decreasing distance between the vehicles. Given these factors, the scenario presents an extreme risk of collision within the next few seconds.  Further projections are needed to ascertain if the fluctuating accelerations will avert a collision, but based on the current trajectories and velocities, an immediate risk exists.

    "Reasoning": "Obstacle 30700.0 poses an extreme risk (score 1) due to its proximity, higher speed, and closing distance to the ego vehicle within the same lanelet. The lateral distance is significant but not enough to guarantee safety given the current trajectories."
