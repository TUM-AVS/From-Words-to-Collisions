### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 30700.0
- Distance Risk reason: The obstacle is in the same lane and getting closer to the ego vehicle over time. At the last timestep, the lateral distance is small and longitudinal distance is decreasing, posing a risk.
- Distance safety score: 2
- Time Risk reason: While the obstacle's velocity is higher than the ego vehicle's, both are moving in the same general direction, and the relative velocity indicates a decreasing trend over time, slightly reducing the time-related risk.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 2

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. **Identify Obstacles:** One obstacle (ID 30700.0) is present and in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle.
2. **Analyze Trajectory:** Over the observed timesteps, the obstacle and ego vehicle are moving in the same general direction, with the obstacle initially ahead. The obstacle's position relative to the ego vehicle indicates a closing distance, although its fluctuating acceleration adds complexity.
3. **Calculate Metrics (for the latest timestep):**  The distance between the two vehicles has been decreasing over time. The relative velocity is positive, indicating the obstacle is moving slightly faster, but the decreasing trend over time might indicate the obstacle slowing down. Therefore, there is some concern about the risk of a future collision.
4. **Conclusion:** Due to the proximity, relative velocities, and observed trajectories, the scenario is evaluated as a high-risk situation at the most recent timestep, but it's not a certain collision, hence there is still no indication of immediate collision nor extreme risk.
