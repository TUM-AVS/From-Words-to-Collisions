Obstacle 30700 is approaching the ego vehicle from behind at a high rate of speed. In the most recent timestep (7.7 seconds), the longitudinal distance is only -0.07 meters, meaning it is extremely close to the ego vehicle's rear bumper.  The relative longitudinal velocity indicates that the obstacle is still moving towards the ego vehicle. This represents an extremely dangerous situation.
