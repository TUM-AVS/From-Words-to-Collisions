Obstacle 30700 is very close to the ego vehicle, with a longitudinal distance of only -0.07 meters at the most recent timestep (7.7 seconds).  The negative distance indicates it's behind the ego vehicle.  The relative longitudinal velocity shows that the obstacle is closing in at 2.58 m/s.  While lateral movement isn't a significant factor currently (0.00 m lateral distance and speed), the fluctuating lateral acceleration suggests some instability or potential lane change by the obstacle. The continuous decrease in longitudinal distance implies a high risk of collision in the next few timesteps if the current trend continues.

**Risk Levels and Definitions:**
<Collision (Score: 0)>: Actual collision has occurred or is unavoidable within the next timestep.
<Extreme Risk (Score: 1)>: Immediate collision or very high likelihood of impact. Urgent action is required.
<High Risk (Score: 2)>: Close to collision or highly probable collision path. Needs prompt attention and quick manoeuvring.
<Medium Risk (Score: 3)>: Moderate collision risk but manageable with timely reactions and proper strategies.
<Low Risk (Score: 4)>: Minimal collision risk. The situation is controllable with sufficient time to react.
<Negligible Risk (Score: 5)>: No significant collision risk. Obstacles are either moving away or far enough not to interfere.
