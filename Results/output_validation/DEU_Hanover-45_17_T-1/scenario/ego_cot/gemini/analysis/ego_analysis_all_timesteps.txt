### Safety analysis for timestep 6.8s - 7.7s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:
- **Obstacle ID:** 30700
- **Distance Risk reason:** The obstacle is consistently approaching the ego vehicle from behind, with longitudinal distances decreasing from -2.37m to -0.07m over the analyzed time steps. Lateral distance also decreases similarly, indicating a potential rear-end collision. The negative sign indicates the obstacle is behind the ego vehicle.
- **Distance safety score:** 1 (Extreme Risk)
- **Time Risk reason:**  Given the closing longitudinal velocities (around 2.5 m/s) and decreasing distances, the TTC is very short, indicating imminent collision risk if the ego vehicle doesn't accelerate or the obstacle doesn't decelerate significantly.  Although lateral velocity is zero, the small lateral distances coupled with varying lateral accelerations still pose a risk.
- **Time safety score:** 1 (Extreme Risk)
- **Overall Risk score:** 1 (Extreme Risk - due to the imminent rear-end collision risk indicated by both distance and time metrics.)


### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
  "CollisionObstacle": {
    "ObstacleID": "30700",
    "OverallRiskScore": "1"
  },
  "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {
    "ObstacleID": "30700",
    "OverallRiskScore": "1"
  },
  "IsCollisionScenario": true,
  "Justification": "Obstacle 30700 poses an extreme risk of a rear-end collision with the ego vehicle within the next second, as evidenced by the rapidly decreasing longitudinal and lateral distances and short TTC.  The data suggests a high probability of impact if evasive maneuvers aren't taken immediately."
