Obstacle 30700 is behind the ego vehicle and approaching rapidly.  The longitudinal distance has been decreasing across all timesteps, from -2.37m at 6.8 seconds to -0.07m at 7.7 seconds (the most recent timestep). The lateral distance remains consistently at 0.00m, indicating the obstacle is directly behind the ego vehicle in the same lane.

The relative longitudinal velocity is consistently around 2.5 m/s, showing continuous rapid approach. While the relative acceleration fluctuates, the overall trend is still towards a collision given the consistently decreasing longitudinal distance.

At the last timestep (7.7 seconds), the longitudinal distance is -0.07m.  The obstacle is extremely close. With a relative longitudinal velocity of 2.58 m/s, the TTC is -0.07 / 2.58 = -0.027 seconds. This negative TTC, combined with the very small MDC (0.07m), and the continuous approach across all timesteps, strongly suggests an imminent collision or a collision that has just occurred.

**Risk Assessment for Obstacle 30700:**
* **MDC:** 0.07m (Extreme Risk - 1)
* **TTC:** -0.027s (Extreme Risk - 1)
* **Overall Risk:** 1 (Extreme Risk - Collision likely without intervention) - Given the extremely small distance and negative TTC, this is an extremely high risk situation where collision is imminent.

**Collision Scenario Determination:**

Yes, this is a collision scenario. Obstacle 30700 poses an Extreme Risk (1) with an extremely low MDC and negative TTC, indicating a likely imminent collision.
