### Obstacle-by-Obstacle Analysis

#### Obstacle 30700 Analysis

**Trajectory Analysis Across Timesteps:**
- The obstacle is consistently moving toward the ego vehicle from the rear.
- The longitudinal distance is consistently decreasing, indicating the obstacle is approaching.
- Relative velocity is consistently positive, meaning the obstacle is closing in on the ego vehicle.

**At the Most Recent Timestep (7.7 seconds):**
- **Adjusted Longitudinal Distance:** -0.07 m
- **Adjusted Lateral Distance:** 0.00 m
- **Relative Longitudinal Velocity:** 2.58 m/s
- **Relative Lateral Velocity:** 0.00 m/s

**Time-to-Collision (TTC) Calculation:**
- **Longitudinal TTC:** |(-0.07 m) / 2.58 m/s| â‰ˆ 0.027 seconds

**Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC) Calculation:**
- Since the lateral distance is 0.00 m, focus on longitudinal distance.
- The MDC is effectively -0.07 m since the obstacle is longitudinally aligned and closing.

**Risk Assessment:**
- **TTC (0.027 seconds):** Extreme Risk (1) as it is less than 0.5 seconds.
- **MDC (-0.07 m):** Qualifies as Collision Risk (0) due to negative distance.
  
**Overall Risk Score:**
- The lower of the two risk assessments (lower score is higher risk): 0 (Collision occurring).

**Analysis Alignment with Motion Description:**
- The obstacle is described as "driving toward the ego car from behind" with an exact lateral alignment, corroborating the collision status indicated by both a near-zero and negative longitudinal distance and positive closing velocity.

### Conclusion

This scenario qualifies as a collision scenario because the distance is effectively zero or negative in both adjusted dimensions with a significantly closing longitudinal velocity.
