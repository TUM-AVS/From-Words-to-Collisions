### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 30700
- Relative Direction: Behind
- Distance Risk Reason: The obstacle is very close behind the ego vehicle, with a longitudinal distance of -0.07m.  The consistent decrease in longitudinal distance and TTC over the past several timesteps indicates a high risk of collision. Lateral distance is not a factor as the obstacle is directly behind.
- Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 1
- Lateral Distance Safety Score: 5
- Overall Distance Safety Score: 1.0
- Time Risk Reason: The TTC is extremely low at 0.03 seconds, indicating an imminent collision if the current trajectories continue. This aligns with the decreasing trend observed in the previous timesteps.  Lateral TTC is not a factor given the obstacle's position directly behind.
- Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 1
- Lateral Time Safety Score: 5
- Overall Time Safety Score: 1.0
- Overall Risk Score: 1
