Here's the collision risk analysis based on the provided data:

**Analysis:**

* **Obstacles 30, 31, and 36:** These obstacles are stationary and located in a different lanelet (1696) than the ego vehicle (1697).  While the y-coordinates are somewhat close, the x-coordinate difference suggests sufficient lateral separation. These present negligible risk. (Risk score: 5)

* **Obstacle 338:** This obstacle is in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle (1697) and moving with a higher velocity than the ego vehicle. The x-coordinates indicate that obstacle 338 is ahead of the ego vehicle, and gradually pulling further away.  There is no immediate risk of collision, but the relative velocities warrant monitoring. The distance between the ego vehicle and obstacle 338 is increasing with time. (Risk score: 4)

* **Obstacles 341 and 343:** These obstacles are in different lanelets (3281/3990) than the ego vehicle and located to the left (y-coordinate is bigger). Their trajectories do not appear to intersect with the ego vehicle's path in the provided timeframe. (Risk score: 5)

* **Obstacle 342:** This obstacle is also in a different lanelet (3871) than the ego vehicle. Although its y-coordinate is closer to the ego vehicle than 341 and 343, the x and y coordinates suggest it poses a low risk within the observed time frame. However, it should be noted that this obstacle moves towards the ego vehicle and its position becomes closer to the ego vehicle with time. If the current trend continues, a collision might happen. Therefore, this obstacle is classified into high-risk obstacles. (Risk score: 2)
