Obstacles 30, 31, and 36 are stationary and positioned in a different lanelet (1696) than the ego vehicle (1697), posing negligible risk.

Obstacle 338 is in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle (1697) and moving significantly faster. Although its x-position is increasing away from the ego vehicle's x-position, it's important to consider the relative velocities and future trajectories for a definitive risk assessment. Given the provided data, the risk appears to be low to medium, as the distance between them is increasing.

Obstacles 341, 342, and 343 are in different lanelets and don't appear to pose an immediate threat based on their current positions and trajectories.
