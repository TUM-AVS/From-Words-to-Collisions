Obstacle 338 is showing concerning behavior.  It's in the same lane as the ego vehicle and rapidly approaching from behind at a significantly higher speed (14.98 m/s vs. 2.12 m/s). While a collision isn't imminent in the next second, the rapid speed differential and acceleration trend for both vehicles suggest a high probability of an imminent collision if the ego vehicle decelerates or obstacle 338 does not. The risk level is high (level 2) as it requires immediate attention and action.  Obstacle 30, 31, and 36 are stationary and present no immediate risk. Obstacles 341, 342 and 343 are also far and not in the same lanelet as Ego, thus presenting negligible risk.
