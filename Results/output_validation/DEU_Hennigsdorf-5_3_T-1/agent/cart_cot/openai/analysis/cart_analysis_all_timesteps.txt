At the most recent timestep (2.6 seconds), let's evaluate the scenario:

### Evaluation:

1. **Ego Vehicle Position and Trend**:
   - Position at (126.0965, -707.8411)
   - Current velocity of 2.1218, decelerating (-1.873 acceleration)
   - The Ego vehicle is slowing down over time and remains in lanelet 1697.0.

2. **Obstacles**:

   - **Obstacle 30.0**: Static, no risk
   - **Obstacle 31.0**: Static, no risk
   - **Obstacle 36.0**: Static, no risk

   - **Obstacle 338.0**:
     - Position at (153.4603, -711.34755), velocity increasing to 14.983814
     - Same lanelet as Ego (1697.0), fast approaching
     - Significant risk due to high relative velocity and same lane position
     - **TTC** and **MDC** indicate likelihood of collision if trends continue
   
   - **Obstacle 342.0**:
     - Position at (120.1515, -707.62461), moving with 11.033255 velocity
     - Different lanelet, on a parallel course, low risk
  
   - **Obstacle 343.0**:
     - Position at (97.793408, -702.71516), on a different lanelet, no immediate risk despite consistent velocity.

**Analysis for Obstacle 338.0**: Obstacle 338 is in the same lanelet as the Ego and exhibits significant velocity increase, suggesting an imminent rear-end collision risk due to Ego's deceleration and the obstacle's acceleration trend. The TTC and MDC both highlight a rapidly closing gap, marking it as an extreme risk, potentially progressing to a collision without intervention.
