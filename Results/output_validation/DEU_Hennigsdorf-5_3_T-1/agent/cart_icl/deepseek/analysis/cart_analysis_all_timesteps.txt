### Analysis:

1. **Obstacle 30**: 
   - Position: (124.9111, -704.43004) (static)
   - Ego is approaching this obstacle (distance decreasing).
   - At 2.6s, ego is at (126.0965, -707.8411), obstacle is at (124.9111, -704.43004).
   - Lateral distance: ~3.41m (likely in adjacent lane).
   - TTC: Not directly in path, but close. Risk is **Medium (3)**.

2. **Obstacle 338**: 
   - Moving towards ego at high speed (14.98 m/s).
   - At 2.6s, ego is at (126.0965, -707.8411), obstacle is at (153.4603, -711.34755).
   - Distance: ~27.5m, closing rapidly.
   - Same lanelet (1697.0), but still far. Risk is **High (2)**.

3. **Obstacle 342**: 
   - Moving towards ego (11.03 m/s).
   - At 2.6s, ego is at (126.0965, -707.8411), obstacle is at (120.1515, -707.62461).
   - Distance: ~5.94m, lateral distance ~0.22m (very close).
   - TTC: ~5.94 / (11.03 - 2.12) â‰ˆ 0.67s.
   - Risk is **Extreme (1)** due to imminent collision.

4. **Obstacle 343**: 
   - Moving away from ego (7.81 m/s).
   - Distance increasing. Risk is **Low (4)**.

5. Other obstacles (31, 36, 341): 
   - Static or moving away. Risk is **Negligible (5)**.
