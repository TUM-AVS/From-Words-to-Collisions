Obstacle 30, 31, and 36 are stationary and positioned laterally to the ego vehicle, posing no immediate risk.  Obstacle 338 is in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle and moving faster, but is sufficiently far ahead, posing a low risk. Obstacle 342, while in a different lanelet, is relatively close to the ego vehicle; however, its trajectory does not appear to intersect with the ego vehicle's path in the immediate future.  Obstacle 343 is in a different lanelet and poses no immediate risk.
