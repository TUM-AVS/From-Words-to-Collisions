To evaluate the risk level of different obstacles concerning the ego vehicle, we will focus on the latest data at 2.6 seconds and analyze the movement trends up to this point. Here's the analysis:

**Latest Position and Movements at 2.6 seconds:**

- **Ego:**
  - Position: (126.0965, -707.8411)
  - Velocity: 2.1218 m/s
  - Acceleration: -1.873 m/sÂ²
  - Orientation: -0.1205 radians

**Obstacles Analysis:**

1. **Obstacle 30:**
   - Position: (124.9111, -704.43004)
   - Velocity: 0.0 m/s
   - The obstacle is stationary in its lanelet. Given its location and the negative acceleration of the ego vehicle, this obstacle does not pose an immediate threat since it's on a different lanelet and is not moving.

2. **Obstacle 31:**
   - Position: (132.9169, -705.38292)
   - Velocity: 0.0 m/s
   - Similarly, it's stationary and located in different lanelet, with no immediate risk due to the static position and existent lane separation.

3. **Obstacle 36:**
   - Position: (139.72437, -706.19318)
   - Velocity: 0.0 m/s
   - Another static obstacle in a different lanelet, posing no immediate risk.

4. **Obstacle 338:**
   - Position: (153.4603, -711.34755)
   - Velocity: 14.983814 m/s
   - This obstacle is in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle and closing at a relative speed, potentially posing a risk. However, due to the significant positional distance and the orientation, it's not immediately critical but needs monitoring.

5. **Obstacle 342:**
   - Position: (120.1515, -707.62461)
   - Velocity: 11.033255 m/s
   - While moving in a different lanelet, due to its high velocity and proximity, it requires attention. However, based on its position and orientation difference, it's not high risk for collision with the ego.

6. **Obstacle 343:**
   - Position: (97.793408, -702.71516)
   - Velocity: 7.8115197 m/s
   - Moving at a decent speed, but on a different path with no immediate threat detected based on the orientation and position.

**Conclusion and Risk Summary:**

- **Collision Risk (0):** No collision was observed or unavoidable when considering calculated relative movement.
- **Extreme Risk (1):** No obstacles present an extreme risk as barriers are either stationary or well-oriented not to influence the ego.
- **High Risk (2):** None hit the threshold due to different lanelets and manageable distances.
