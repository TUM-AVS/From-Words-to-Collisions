At t=2.6s, Obstacle 342 poses a high risk due to its close proximity behind the ego vehicle and a high probability of collision. Obstacles 30 and 31 are positioned to the left and front-left of the ego vehicle, respectively, exhibiting medium risk. The remaining obstacles do not present any immediate risk of collision.

Obstacle 30: This obstacle is positioned to the left of the ego vehicle and maintains a safe lateral distance. The longitudinal velocity indicates it is nearly stationary relative to the ego vehicle, minimizing risk. Overall Risk Score: 3

Obstacle 31: Situated in the front-left of the ego vehicle, this obstacle is relatively close, but the distance is not extremely concerning. The longitudinal velocity indicates a closing motion but not at a rate to cause extreme risk. Overall Risk Score: 3

Obstacle 36: Located further ahead and to the left of the ego vehicle, this obstacle poses minimal risk due to its larger distance and slow relative velocity. Overall Risk Score: 4

Obstacle 338: This obstacle is far ahead of the ego vehicle and moving away, eliminating any risk. Overall Risk Score: 5

Obstacle 342: This obstacle is very close behind the ego vehicle and moving towards it longitudinally. It presents a high risk of collision in the immediate future. Overall Risk Score: 2

Obstacle 343: While this obstacle is moving away longitudinally, it remains relatively close laterally. However, given the current dynamics, it doesn't pose an immediate risk of collision. Overall Risk Score: 4
