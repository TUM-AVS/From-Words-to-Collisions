At t=2.6s, Obstacle 342 is closest to the ego vehicle, with a longitudinal distance of -1.42m (behind the ego vehicle).  It's approaching quickly with a longitudinal relative velocity of 8.90 m/s. While not an immediate collision, this situation requires immediate action to avoid a potential rear-end collision in the next few timesteps.  Therefore, Obstacle 342 poses a High Risk (2). Other obstacles are further away and do not represent an immediate danger.

Risk Levels:
0: Collision - Physical contact occurred or unavoidable
1: Extreme Risk - Immediate collision likely
2: High Risk - Close to collision, needs quick action
3: Medium Risk - Manageable with proper reaction
4: Low Risk - Minimal risk, sufficient time to react
5: Negligible Risk - No significant risk
