### Safety analysis for timestep 2.6 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

**Assumptions and Clarifications:**

* Since adjusted distances (adjusted_d_long, adjusted_d_lat) are not provided in the scenario context, the provided real distance (DTClong, DTClat) will be used.  This will affect the accuracy of the risk assessment.  **Providing adjusted distances is crucial for a realistic evaluation.**
* TTC will be calculated based on the provided relative velocity and distance. If the relative velocity is positive (moving away), TTC is considered infinite (no risk). We will follow TTClat = DTClat/Vrel_lat and TTClong = DTClong/Vrel_long for calculations.


### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 30**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is located to the left of the ego vehicle with 0 longitudinal and lateral distance, indicating a collision.
- Distance safety score: 0
- Time Risk reason:  Obstacle has negative longitudinal velocity, indicating movement towards the ego vehicle. Given the 0 distance, collision is imminent.
- Time safety score: 0
- Overall Risk score: 0

- **Obstacle ID: 31**
- Distance Risk reason:  Obstacle is located to the front-left with 1.97m longitudinal and lateral distance. This close proximity represents a high risk.
- Distance safety score: 2
- Time Risk reason:  Obstacle has negative longitudinal velocity, indicating movement towards the ego vehicle. The small distance and closing velocity create a high risk.
- Time safety score: 2
- Overall Risk score: 2

- **Obstacle ID: 36**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is located to the front-left at 8.82m longitudinal and lateral distance.  This signifies a medium risk.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason:  Obstacle has negative longitudinal velocity and is approaching the ego vehicle but has ample time and distance to react.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3

- **Obstacle ID: 338**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is in front of the ego vehicle at 23.08m, posing no immediate risk.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Obstacle has positive longitudinal velocity, and is moving away from the ego vehicle.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 342**
- Distance Risk reason:  Obstacle is behind the ego vehicle with -1.42m longitudinal and lateral distance, indicating an extremely high risk.
- Distance safety score: 1
- Time Risk reason:  Obstacle has positive longitudinal velocity, meaning that it is approaching from behind quickly, making it high risk.
- Time safety score: 1
- Overall Risk score: 1

- **Obstacle ID: 343**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is located rear-left, far from the ego vehicle (-24.21m), representing no immediate risk.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason:  Though the obstacle has a negative longitudinal velocity, the large distance means there is negligible risk
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5
