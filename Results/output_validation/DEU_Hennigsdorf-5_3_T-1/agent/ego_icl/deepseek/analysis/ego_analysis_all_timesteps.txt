Let me analyze the most recent timestep (2.6 seconds) for each obstacle:

1. Obstacle 30 (Left):
   - Lateral distance: 1.63m (stable)
   - Longitudinal alignment (0.00m)
   - No lateral relative motion
   - MDC: 1.63m (lateral)
   - TTC: N/A (not closing)
   - Risk: 3 (Medium) - stable side position

2. Obstacle 31 (Front-left):
   - Longitudinal distance: 1.97m (closing at 2.12m/s)
   - Lateral distance: 1.65m (stable)
   - TTC: 1.97/2.12 = 0.93s
   - MDC: 1.65m (lateral)
   - Risk: 2 (High) - rapidly approaching frontally

3. Obstacle 36 (Front-left):
   - Longitudinal distance: 8.82m (closing at 2.12m/s)
   - Lateral distance: 1.66m (stable)
   - TTC: 8.82/2.12 = 4.16s
   - MDC: 1.66m (lateral)
   - Risk: 4 (Low) - distant approach

4. Obstacle 338 (Front):
   - Longitudinal distance: 23.08m (moving away at 12.86m/s)
   - Lateral alignment (0.00m)
   - Risk: 5 (No Risk) - moving away rapidly

5. Obstacle 342 (Behind):
   - Longitudinal distance: -1.42m (approaching at 8.90m/s)
   - Lateral alignment (0.00m)
   - TTC: 1.42/8.90 = 0.16s
   - Risk: 1 (Extreme) - imminent rear collision

6. Obstacle 343 (Rear-left):
   - Longitudinal distance: -24.21m (moving away)
   - Lateral distance: 0.08m (closing at 7.81m/s)
   - TTC: 0.08/7.81 = 0.01s
   - Risk: 0 (Collision) - lateral contact imminent

Trajectory Analysis:
- Obstacle 342 shows consistent rear approach with increasing speed (7.03m/s→8.90m/s)
- Obstacle 31 maintains steady frontal approach
- Obstacle 343 shows dangerous lateral convergence (7.20m→0.08m in 0.9s)
