* **Obstacle 30 (Left):** Lateral distance is 1.63m, longitudinal distance is 0.00m.  The lateral distance is stable, and the longitudinal velocity is negative indicating the obstacle and ego vehicle might be driving in the same direction. Risk level: Medium (3)

* **Obstacle 31 (Front-Left):** Longitudinal distance is 1.97m, lateral distance is 1.65m, longitudinal relative velocity is -2.12 m/s.  TTC_longitudinal = 1.97/2.12 = 0.93s. The obstacle is approaching the ego vehicle, which represents a high risk. Risk level: High (2)

* **Obstacle 36 (Front-Left):** Longitudinal distance is 8.82m, lateral distance is 1.66m, longitudinal relative velocity is -2.12 m/s. TTC_longitudinal = 8.82/2.12 = 4.16s. Risk level: Low (4)

* **Obstacle 338 (Front):** Longitudinal distance is 23.08m, lateral distance is 0.00m. The obstacle is moving away from the ego vehicle longitudinally with a positive relative velocity.  Risk level: Negligible (5)

* **Obstacle 342 (Behind):** Longitudinal distance is -1.42m, lateral distance is 0.00m.  The obstacle is very close behind and approaching rapidly based on the positive relative velocity. The negative longitudinal distance combined with the motion description suggests a high risk of rear-end collision. Risk level: Extreme (1)

* **Obstacle 343 (Rear-Left):** Longitudinal distance is -24.21m, lateral distance is 0.08m. Although the lateral distance is minimal, the large negative longitudinal distance and negative longitudinal velocity indicate that this obstacle is moving away and does not pose a collision risk. Risk level: Negligible (5)
