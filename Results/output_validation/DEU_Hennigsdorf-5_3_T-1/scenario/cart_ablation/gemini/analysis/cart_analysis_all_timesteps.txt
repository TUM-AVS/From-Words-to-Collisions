At t=2.8s, the ego vehicle is at (126.5262, -707.8932) with a velocity of 1.6862 m/s and decelerating at -1.2092 m/sÂ².  Obstacle 30, 31, and 36 are stationary and pose no immediate threat. Obstacle 338 is in the same lane but sufficiently far ahead. Obstacle 343 is also far and in a different lane.  Obstacle 342, however, is at (122.3586, -707.86766) in the same lane and traveling at 11.212749 m/s.  The small difference in y-coordinates (-707.8932 vs -707.86766), coupled with the large velocity difference and ego's deceleration suggests an impending rear-end collision with obstacle 342 is highly likely unless immediate evasive action is taken. Thus, obstacle 342 is classified as an extreme risk.
