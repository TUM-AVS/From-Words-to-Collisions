At t=2.8s, Ego (1.0) is at (126.5262, -707.8932) in lanelet 1697.0 with a velocity of 1.6862 m/s and decelerating.

Obstacle 338.0 is in the same lanelet as Ego, significantly ahead and moving faster. No immediate risk.

Obstacle 342.0 is now also in lanelet 1697.0 at (122.3586, -707.86766), very close to Ego.  Given the close proximity and Ego's deceleration, an immediate collision is unlikely, but still represents a high risk if Ego does not continue decelerating or Obstacle 342.0 does not adjust its trajectory.

Obstacle 30.0, 31.0, and 36.0 are stationary and in a different lanelet (1696.0), posing no immediate risk.

Obstacles 341.0 and 343.0 are in different lanelets and far enough away to be of negligible risk.

Because of the close proximity of Obstacle 342.0, this is considered a high-risk scenario but not an immediate collision.
