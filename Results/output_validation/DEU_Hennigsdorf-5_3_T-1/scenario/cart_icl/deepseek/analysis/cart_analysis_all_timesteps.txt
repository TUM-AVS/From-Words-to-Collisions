### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. **Obstacle 342.0** is the only high-risk obstacle, moving towards the ego vehicle in the same lanelet with a high relative velocity (TTC ~0.36s). This poses an extreme risk (score 1).
2. All other obstacles are either static, moving away, or in non-intersecting lanelets.
3. No collision has occurred yet, but Obstacle 342.0 requires immediate evasive action.
