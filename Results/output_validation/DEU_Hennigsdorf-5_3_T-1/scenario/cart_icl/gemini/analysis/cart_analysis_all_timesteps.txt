### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
No obstacles pose an immediate collision risk. Obstacle 338 is approaching from behind at a higher speed but is still a safe distance away. Obstacle 342 recently merged into the ego vehicle's lane but maintains a safe following distance. No collision is imminent.

### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
  "CollisionObstacles": null,
  "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null,
  "ScenarioAnalysis": {
    "IsCollisionScenario": false,
    "Reasoning": "No obstacle is on a direct collision course with the ego vehicle at the most recent timestep. While some obstacles are relatively close, they are either stationary, moving away, or maintaining a safe following distance."
