### Obstacle Analysis:

#### Obstacle 30.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: Static obstacle very close to lanelet boundary but separated from the ego's path.
- **Distance safety score**: 4
- **Time Risk reason**: No movement detected over all timesteps, no time-based collision risk.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 4

#### Obstacle 31.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: Static and positioned away from the ego path.
- **Distance safety score**: 4
- **Time Risk reason**: No velocity or acceleration, indicating no immediate threat over time.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 4

#### Obstacle 36.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: Static obstacle positioned safely due to ego's trajectory.
- **Distance safety score**: 4
- **Time Risk reason**: Zero velocity ensures no time-based collision concern.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 4

#### Obstacle 338.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: Fast-moving in the same lanelet with decreasing longitudinal gap.
- **Distance safety score**: 2
- **Time Risk reason**: Increased acceleration and high velocity suggest potential collision if ego continues at current speed; TTC is low.
- **Time safety score**: 2
- **Overall Risk score**: 2

#### Obstacle 342.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: Increasing proximity but not immediately threatening.
- **Distance safety score**: 3
- **Time Risk reason**: Relative velocity and acceleration indicate minor risk, not an immediate crash trajectory.
- **Time safety score**: 3
- **Overall Risk score**: 3

#### Obstacle 343.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: Located on a separate/adjacent lanelet, moving steadily.
- **Distance safety score**: 4
- **Time Risk reason**: Consistent, low-risk velocity and acceleration trend.
- **Time safety score**: 4
- **Overall Risk score**: 4

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
- The static obstacles (30.0, 31.0, 36.0) do not pose any collision risk.
- Obstacle 338.0 is the most concerning due to high speed matching the ego's lanelet and trajectory.
- Other moving obstacles (342.0, 343.0) show minor risk but are not in direct paths leading to a collision.
- No obstacle suggests a collision in the scenario; however, vehicle 338.0 demands close monitoring.
