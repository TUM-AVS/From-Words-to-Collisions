### Safety analysis for timestep 1.9s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 30
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 30 has 0 longitudinal and lateral distance indicating a collision with the ego vehicle.
- Distance safety score: 0
- Time Risk reason: The obstacle is currently colliding, hence TTC is 0.
- Time safety score: 0
- Overall Risk score: 0

- Obstacle ID: 31
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 31 is in the Front-left, with both longitudinal and lateral distances of 4.78m.  While not immediately colliding, the short distance and closing velocity represent a high risk.
- Distance safety score: 2
- Time Risk reason: The closing longitudinal velocity is -5.34 m/s, along with positive acceleration implies a decreasing TTC, raising concern. 
- Time safety score: 2
- Overall Risk score: 2

- Obstacle ID: 36
- Distance Risk reason: Situated Front-left at 11.63m longitudinally and laterally. Poses less immediate risk than Obstacle 31 due to the larger distance.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: Approaching longitudinally at -5.34 m/s necessitates monitoring but allows more time to react compared to Obstacle 31.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3

- Obstacle ID: 338
- Distance Risk reason: Located in front at 15.80m, this obstacle is moving away longitudinally at 8.60 m/s, significantly reducing risk.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: The positive and increasing longitudinal velocity indicates divergence, making collision unlikely.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 341
- Distance Risk reason: Positioned Rear-right at -21.09m, and moving away both longitudinally and laterally, posing no risk.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: The motion indicates increasing separation, eliminating collision possibility.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 342
- Distance Risk reason: At -6.16m behind and closing, this obstacle requires attention.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: Approaching at 5.01 m/s longitudinally increases the risk of rear-end collision.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3

- Obstacle ID: 343
- Distance Risk reason: Located Rear-left at -21.58m, moving away longitudinally but approaching laterally.  The large longitudinal distance mitigates the lateral movement.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason:  While the lateral motion warrants observation, the longitudinal separation makes collision unlikely.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4


### Safety analysis for timestep 2.0s - 2.7s:
*Analysis and scores similar to 1.9s would be applied here, with appropriate updates to the values and reasoning based on the changing distances, velocities, and accelerations. It is crucial to observe how the risk levels for Obstacles 31 and 342 evolve, particularly since they are closing in on the ego vehicle.*

### Safety analysis for timestep 2.8s:
*Here, it's evident that Obstacle 342 has collided with the ego vehicle as indicated by the 0 distance and the term "Collision". This would result in a score of 0 for all metrics related to this obstacle.  All other obstacles should be evaluated as in previous timesteps.*


### Summary in JSON Format:

  },
  "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {
    "ObstacleID": "31",
    "OverallRiskScore": "1"
  },
  "IsCollisionScenario": true,
  "Justification": "Obstacle 30 shows 0 distance at the initial timestep and the motion description explicitly states 'Collision' with Obstacle 342 at 2.8 seconds."
}
