* **Obstacle 30 (Left):**  This obstacle maintains exact longitudinal alignment with the ego vehicle (0.00m) over multiple timesteps, while the lateral distance remains steady at 1.63m.  Although longitudinally aligned, there's no longitudinal relative motion in the last timestep (-1.69 m/s), and a safe lateral distance. Thus, no immediate collision risk.
    * _MDC:_ 1.63m (Medium Risk)
    * _TTC (Longitudinal):_ Not applicable due to negative relative velocity but minimal. 
    * _TTC (Lateral):_  Not applicable (no lateral relative motion)
    * _Overall Risk:_ 3 (Medium Risk) - due to the close longitudinal alignment.

* **Obstacle 31 (Front-Left):** This obstacle is approaching the ego vehicle longitudinally, with the longitudinal distance decreasing from 4.78m to 1.53m over the timesteps. The lateral distance remains relatively constant around 1.65m. The decreasing longitudinal distance combined with the negative longitudinal relative velocity (-1.69 m/s) indicates a potential collision risk if this trend continues.
    * _MDC:_ Approximately 1.53m. This uses the last timestep distance. (Medium Risk)
    * _TTC (Longitudinal):_ 1.53m / 1.69 m/s ≈ 0.9s (High Risk)
    * _TTC (Lateral):_ Not applicable (no lateral relative motion)
    * _Overall Risk:_ 2 (High Risk)

* **Obstacle 36 (Front-Left):** This obstacle is also approaching longitudinally, but it's farther away than Obstacle 31. The longitudinal distance decreases from 11.63m to 8.39m. Similar constant lateral distance around 1.66m.
    * _MDC:_ Approximately 8.39m (No Risk)
    * _TTC (Longitudinal):_ 8.39m / 1.69 m/s ≈ 4.96s (Low Risk)
    * _TTC (Lateral):_  Not applicable (no lateral relative motion)
    * _Overall Risk:_ 4 (Low Risk)

* **Obstacle 338 (Front):** This obstacle is moving *away* from the ego vehicle longitudinally, increasing from 15.80m to 20.68 and above.  It presents no collision risk.
    * _MDC:_ >5m (No Risk)
    * _TTC (Longitudinal):_ Not applicable (diverging).
    * _TTC (Lateral):_ Not applicable (minimal lateral relative motion)
    * _Overall Risk:_ 5 (No Risk)


* **Obstacle 341 (Rear-Right):** This obstacle is moving *away* from the ego vehicle both longitudinally and laterally. It poses no risk.
    * _MDC:_ > 5m (No risk)
    * _TTC:_ Not applicable (diverging)
    * _Overall Risk:_ 5 (No Risk)

* **Obstacle 342 (Behind/Collision at last timestep):** This obstacle, initially behind the ego vehicle, exhibits a concerning trajectory. Its longitudinal distance decreases significantly across the timesteps, ultimately resulting in a collision at the final timestep (0.00m longitudinal and lateral distance). The motion description confirms "Collision". 
    * _MDC:_ 0m (Collision Risk)
    * _TTC (Longitudinal):_  0 (Collision Risk)
    * _TTC (Lateral):_ 0 (Collision Risk)
    * _Overall Risk:_ 0 (Collision)

* **Obstacle 343 (Rear-Left/Behind at last timestep):**  This obstacle's path is complex. While moving away longitudinally, it was approaching laterally. At the final timestep, both are at 0.00m, though the description notes it's behind. It is no longer a risk given its position and velocity.

    * _MDC:_ Approximately 0m at the collision point if projected backward
    * _TTC (Longitudinal):_ Negative TTC but not applicable.
    * _TTC (Lateral):_ Negative TTC but not applicable.
    * _Overall Risk:_ 5 (No Risk)


**Collision Scenario Determination:** Yes, this is a collision scenario. Obstacle 342 has collided with the ego vehicle at the last timestep, evidenced by both the 0.00m distances and the "Collision" designation in the motion description.
