### Analysis for the Most Recent Timestep at 2.8 seconds:

**Obstacle 30:**
- **Position & Direction:** Left of the ego car, adjusted long 0.00 m, lateral 1.63 m
- **Velocity:** Longitudinal -1.69 m/s (moving leftward)
- **Trajectory:** No change in lateral distance, aligned side-by-side
- **TTC Calculation:** Not applicable laterally due to zero relative motion 
- **MDC Calculation:** 1.63 meters (lateral side-by-side distance)
- **Risk Assessment:** No lateral motion and stable side position; No Risk (5)

**Obstacle 31:**
- **Position & Direction:** Front-left, adjusted long 1.53 m, lateral 1.65 m
- **Velocity:** Longitudinal -1.69 m/s (approaching the ego vehicle)
- **TTC Calculation:** 1.53 m / 1.69 m/s = 0.91 seconds
- **MDC Calculation:** Minimum projected lateral distance is stable at 1.65 meters
- **Risk Assessment:** High Risk (2) due to TTC < 1.0s

**Obstacle 36:**
- **Position & Direction:** Front-left, adjusted long 8.39 m, lateral 1.66 m
- **Velocity:** Longitudinal -1.69 m/s (approaching the ego vehicle)
- **TTC Calculation:** 8.39 m / 1.69 m/s = 4.96 seconds
- **MDC Calculation:** 1.66 meters (safe lateral alignment)
- **Risk Assessment:** Low Risk (4)

**Obstacle 342:**
- **Position & Direction:** Collision of ego car, adjusted long 0.00 m, lateral 0.00 m
- **Velocity:** Longitudinal 9.53 m/s (relative closing velocity)
- **Trajectory:** Exact longitudinal and lateral alignment with closing velocity
- **Collision Assessment:** Distances are 0 in both dimensions with positive closing velocity
- **Risk Assessment:** Collision occurring (0)

**Obstacle 343:**
- **Position & Direction:** Behind, adjusted long -24.58 m, lateral 0.00 m
- **Velocity:** Longitudinal -1.40 m/s (moving away)
- **Trajectory:** Alignment but increasing separation
- **TTC Calculation:** Not approaching, trajectory diverging
- **MDC Calculation:** Negative and increasing in size
- **Risk Assessment:** No Risk (5)

### Conclusion
This scenario is a collision scenario as Obstacle 342 shows a direct collision occurring due to exact alignment in both longitudinal and lateral dimensions with a positive relative velocity suggesting an impact is occurring.

### JSON Summary:
```json
{
    "CollisionObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "342",
        "OverallRiskScore": "0"
    },
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null,
    "IsCollisionScenario": true,
    "Justification": "Obstacle 342 is in direct collision with exact alignment in both dimensions and positive velocity."
}
```

The primary justification for declaring this a collision scenario centers on obstacle 342, which has zero distance in both lateral and longitudinal dimensions, indicating a current collision.
