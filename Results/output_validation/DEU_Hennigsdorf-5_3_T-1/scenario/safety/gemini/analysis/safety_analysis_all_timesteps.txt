### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 30
- Relative Direction: Left
- Distance Risk Reason:  Laterally safe distance, longitudinally colliding (DTClat = 1.63 > 5, DTClong = 0). The lateral distance has remained constant, while the longitudinal distance has consistently been 0 over multiple timesteps, showing no sign of improvement.
- Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 0
- Lateral Distance Safety Score: 3
- Overall Distance Safety Score: 3.0  (0 * 0.0 + 3 * (1-0.0))
- Time Risk Reason: Laterally safe, but longitudinally colliding (TTClat = inf, TTClong = 0). This has persisted over time, indicating a high risk of longitudinal collision.
- Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 0
- Lateral Time Safety Score: 5
- Overall Time Safety Score: 5.0 (0 * 0.0 + 5 * (1-0.0))
- Overall Risk Score: 4 (round(2.5 + 2.5) = round(4))

- Obstacle ID: 31
- Relative Direction: Front-left
- Distance Risk Reason:  Longitudinally and laterally at extreme risk of collision.  DTClong decreasing over time and now critically low (2.53m), as well as DTClat (1.65m) consistently low.
- Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 2
- Lateral Distance Safety Score: 3
- Overall Distance Safety Score: 2.5 (2 * 0.5 + 3 * 0.5)
- Time Risk Reason: TTClong consistently below 1 second over time, indicating persistent high longitudinal risk. TTClat safe at infinity.
- Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 2
- Lateral Time Safety Score: 5
- Overall Time Safety Score: 3.5 (2 * 0.5 + 5 * 0.5)
- Overall Risk Score: 3 (round(1.25 + 1.75) = round(3))

- Obstacle ID: 36
- Relative Direction: Front-left
- Distance Risk Reason: Safe longitudinal distance, low lateral distance.  DTClong > 5m consistently, while DTClat consistently less than 3m.
- Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 5
- Lateral Distance Safety Score: 3
- Overall Distance Safety Score: 4 (5 * 0.5 + 3 * 0.5)
- Time Risk Reason: Safe TTClong, TTClat safe at infinity.
- Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 4
- Lateral Time Safety Score: 5
- Overall Time Safety Score: 4.5 (4 * 0.5 + 5 * 0.5)
- Overall Risk Score: 4 (round(2.0 + 2.25) = round(4.25))

- Obstacle ID: 338
- Relative Direction: Front
- Distance Risk Reason:  Longitudinally safe and laterally colliding. DTClong > 5m consistently, DTClat consistently 0.
- Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 5
- Lateral Distance Safety Score: 0
- Overall Distance Safety Score: 5.0 (5 * 1.0 + 0 * (1-1.0))
- Time Risk Reason:  TTClong is inf, TTClat is 0, representing an unusual and undefined situation.
- Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 5
- Lateral Time Safety Score: 0
- Overall Time Safety Score: 5.0 (5 * 1.0 + 0 * (1-1.0))
- Overall Risk Score: 5 (round(2.5 + 2.5) = round(5))

- Time Risk Reason: TTClong consistently high risk, TTClat colliding and persists.
- Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 1
- Lateral Time Safety Score: 0
- Overall Time Safety Score: 1.0 (1 * 1.0 + 0 * (1-1.0))
- Overall Risk Score: 1 (round(0 + 0.5) = round(0.5))

- Obstacle ID: 343
- Relative Direction: Rear-left
