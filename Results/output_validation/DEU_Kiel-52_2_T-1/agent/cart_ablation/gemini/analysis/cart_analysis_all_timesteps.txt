Obstacle 30664.0: This obstacle is moving with a relatively high velocity and acceleration, but its trajectory doesn't appear to intersect with the ego vehicle's path in the given timeframe. The lateral distance remains significant, so the risk is negligible. Risk score: 5

Obstacle 30665.0: Similar to obstacle 30664.0, this one also maintains a safe lateral distance from the ego vehicle. Although its velocity and acceleration are high, the trajectory doesn't pose an immediate threat. Risk score: 5

Obstacle 30666.0: This obstacle's trajectory is somewhat concerning as it's closer to the ego vehicle. However, the data shows it is moving away from the ego vehicle. Overall Risk score: 4

Obstacle 30667.0:  The trajectory of this obstacle initially suggests a potential collision, but the change in velocity/acceleration and position suggests the obstacle might maneuver away from the ego vehicle. Overall Risk score: 3

Obstacle 30668.0: This obstacle is stationary and poses no immediate risk.  Risk score: 5

Obstacle 30670.0: This obstacle, while moving, maintains enough lateral separation. Risk score: 5

Obstacle 30675.0: This obstacle maintains a safe trajectory and does not represent a collision risk. Risk score: 5

Obstacle 30677.0: Similar to obstacle 30675, this obstacle's trajectory is also safe and doesn't pose a collision risk. Risk score: 5
