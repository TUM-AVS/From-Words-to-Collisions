### Analysis:

- **Obstacle 30664.0**: This vehicle is moving away from the ego in a different lanelet. However, given its proximity and position, it constantly has potential interference due to its high velocity and acceleration.
  
- **Obstacle 30665.0**: This obstacle is some distance from the ego with a high velocity and acceleration, but it is in a different lanelet, reducing the immediate risk of collision.
  
- **Obstacle 30666.0**: Positioned ahead of the ego vehicle within a different lanelet and heading away, it does not pose an immediate risk.

- **Obstacle 30667.0**: Initially close to the ego vehicle in coordinates, and its heading shows a large deviation, but it maintains a significant lateral distance (MDC) without heading into the ego's path.

- **Obstacle 30668.0**: Stationary, directly behind the ego vehicle and not moving, thus presenting no immediate danger.

- **Obstacle 30670.0**: Positioned quite far from the ego vehicle and with a steady decrease in velocity, it poses no imminent threat.

- **Obstacle 30675.0**: Stationary in a distant lanelet from the ego vehicle. No risk of collision.

- **Obstacle 30677.0**: Similar to 30675.0, this obstacle is further away and not aligned with the ego vehicle's path.

```

**Explanation**: 
- **Obstacle 30664.0** is assessed as Extreme Risk due to its proximity in earlier timestamps and potential for sudden lane cross-over or trajectory change that could impact the ego vehicle in the next time frames if the trend continues.
- **Obstacle 30667.0** is assessed as High Risk because it's in closer proximity potentially on a converging path to the ego vehicle, though maintaining a safe lateral distance for now.
