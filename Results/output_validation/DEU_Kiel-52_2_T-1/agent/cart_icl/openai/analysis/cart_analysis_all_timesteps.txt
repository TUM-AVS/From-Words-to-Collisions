To evaluate the collision risk, we analyze the data from the most recent timestamp at 3.6 seconds, focusing on each obstacle's relative motion compared to the ego vehicle.

**Ego Vehicle at 3.6 seconds**:
- Position: (278.2226, -185.3628)
- Velocity: 5.0544 m/s
- Orientation: Positive bearing, consistent with movements along the lanelet.

**Analysis of Obstacles**:

1. **Obstacle 30664**:
   - Position: (255.3102, -196.8873)
   - Velocity: 9.5155 m/s, approaching the ego vehicle.
   - This obstacle is closing in from the rear and has continued acceleration. 
   - Relative position and speed imply it is not in the immediate path of the ego but could pose a future risk if trajectory changes. **Overall Risk Score: 4 (Low Risk)**

2. **Obstacle 30665**:
   - Position: (299.7064, -166.3088)
   - Velocity: 12.1743 m/s, moving faster and in a different lane.
   - Positioned ahead and moving away from the ego vehicle. **Overall Risk Score: 5 (Negligible Risk)**

3. **Obstacle 30666**:
   - Position: (275.7263, -182.7459)
   - Velocity: 5.4171 m/s, similar speed to the ego.
   - Located in an adjacent lanelet without immediate crossing trajectory. **Overall Risk Score: 4 (Low Risk)**

4. **Obstacle 30667**:
   - Position: (276.7911, -174.1706)
   - Velocity: 1.4934 m/s, decelerating rapidly.
   - In closer proximity and same direction, continuous deceleration could lead to rapid approach by ego vehicle. **Overall Risk Score: 2 (High Risk)**

5. **Obstacle 30668**:
   - Stationary at (273.1457, -194.6046).
   - Positioned behind and right of the ego, posing no threat. **Overall Risk Score: 5 (Negligible Risk)**

6. **Obstacle 30670**:
   - Position: (285.0426, -165.7588)
   - Velocity: 3.4726 m/s.
   - Far ahead, but moving slowly and laterally closer to the ego's path. **Overall Risk Score: 3 (Medium Risk)**

7. **Obstacle 30675**:
   - Position: (266.3052, -201.669)
   - Velocity: 2.1095 m/s, also decelerating.
   - Positioned far enough back from the ego with slower speed, causing no immediate threat. **Overall Risk Score: 5 (Negligible Risk)**

8. **Obstacle 30677**:
   - Position: (263.2912, -199.7493)
   - Velocity: 2.6261 m/s, slow and decelerating.
   - Similar to obstacle 30675, posing minimal risk at present. **Overall Risk Score: 5 (Negligible Risk)**

**Summary of Risky Obstacles**:

- **Obstacle 30667** presents the highest risk due to its slow speed and stopping in close proximity in the same travel direction as ego, thereby classified under **High Risk**.
