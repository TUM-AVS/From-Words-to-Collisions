At timestamp 3.6 seconds, let's analyze the risk posed by each obstacle:

* **Obstacle 30664:** Located rear-left, moving away longitudinally and slightly towards the ego vehicle laterally.  Poses no immediate threat. Risk score: 5 (Negligible Risk)

* **Obstacle 30665:** Located in front, moving away longitudinally.  Lateral movement is minimal and not a concern. Risk score: 5 (Negligible Risk)

* **Obstacle 30666:** Located to the left, with almost no longitudinal distance and decreasing lateral distance. Although the longitudinal velocity is relatively low, the continuous lateral approach suggests a potential high risk. Risk score: 2 (High Risk)

* **Obstacle 30667:**  Located front-left and approaching longitudinally, but the distance is still relatively safe. Lateral movement is minimal. Risk score: 4 (Low Risk)

* **Obstacle 30668:** Rear-right and moving away longitudinally, no lateral movement. No immediate risk. Risk score: 5 (Negligible Risk)

* **Obstacle 30670:** Front-left, some distance away but approaching longitudinally.  Lateral movement is minimal. Risk score: 4 (Low Risk)


* **Obstacle 30675:** Rear-right and moving away both longitudinally and laterally. Poses no immediate threat. Risk score: 5 (Negligible Risk)

* **Obstacle 30677:** Located behind and moving away longitudinally.  No significant lateral movement.  Poses no immediate threat. Risk score: 5 (Negligible Risk)


Risk Levels:
0: Collision - Physical contact occurred or unavoidable
1: Extreme Risk - Immediate collision likely
2: High Risk - Close to collision, needs quick action
3: Medium Risk - Manageable with proper reaction
4: Low Risk - Minimal risk, sufficient time to react
5: Negligible Risk - No significant risk
