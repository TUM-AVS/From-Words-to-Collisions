### Safety analysis for timestep 3.6 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

**Assumptions and Clarifications:**

* **Missing Adjusted Distances:** The provided scenario lacks the crucial "adjusted_d_long" and "adjusted_d_lat" values.  These are essential for accurate collision risk assessment.  I will proceed with the analysis using the raw "real distance" values (DTClong, DTClat), but the results *will not be accurate* without accounting for vehicle sizes.  **You must provide the adjusted distances for a reliable safety assessment.**
* **TTC Calculation:**  TTC will be calculated as DTClong / Vrel_long  and DTClat / Vrel_lat.  Negative TTC values imply the objects are moving away from each other.
* **Combined TTC/MDC Risk:** I will combine TTC and MDC risks by taking the minimum of the two scores. This reflects that the most imminent danger (either in time or distance) dictates the overall risk.



### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 30664**
    - Distance Risk reason: Located behind and to the left of the ego vehicle at a significant distance.
    - Distance safety score: 5
    - Time Risk reason: Moving away longitudinally and slowly approaching laterally, but current distances suggest ample time to react.
    - Time safety score: 5
    - Overall Risk score: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 30665**
    - Distance Risk reason: Located far ahead and to the right, posing no immediate threat.
    - Distance safety score: 5
    - Time Risk reason: Moving away longitudinally and slightly approaching laterally, but the distance and relative velocity suggest no immediate risk.
    - Time safety score: 5
    - Overall Risk score: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 30666**
    - Distance Risk reason:  Zero distance reported, indicating a likely collision (using raw values, remember adjusted distances are missing!).
    - Distance safety score: 0 
    - Time Risk reason: Negative longitudinal velocity suggests it might have just collided. Lateral velocity indicates movement towards the ego vehicle.
    - Time safety score: 0
    - Overall Risk score: 0

- **Obstacle ID: 30667**
    - Distance Risk reason: Very close to the ego vehicle, representing a high risk.
    - Distance safety score: 2
    - Time Risk reason:  Approaching quickly longitudinally; TTC is very low.
    - Time safety score: 1
    - Overall Risk score: 1

- **Obstacle ID: 30668**
    - Distance Risk reason: Behind and slightly to the right, but quite close.
    - Distance safety score: 4
    - Time Risk reason: Moving away longitudinally and not moving laterally.
    - Time safety score: 5
    - Overall Risk score: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 30670**
    - Distance Risk reason: Reasonably far ahead and to the left.
    - Distance safety score: 5
    - Time Risk reason: Approaching longitudinally, but with some time to react.
    - Time safety score: 4
    - Overall Risk score: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 30675**
    - Distance Risk reason: Far behind and to the right.
    - Distance safety score: 5
    - Time Risk reason: Moving away longitudinally and slightly approaching laterally, but poses no immediate threat.
    - Time safety score: 5
    - Overall Risk score: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 30677**
    - Distance Risk reason: Far behind.
    - Distance safety score: 5
    - Time Risk reason: Moving away longitudinally and slightly approaching laterally but poses no immediate threat given the distance.
    - Time safety score: 5
    - Overall Risk score: 5
