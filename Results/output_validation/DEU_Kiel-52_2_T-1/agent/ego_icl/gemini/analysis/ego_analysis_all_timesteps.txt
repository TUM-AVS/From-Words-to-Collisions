* **Obstacle 30664 (Rear-Left):**  This obstacle is moving away longitudinally and poses no risk in that dimension. Laterally, it is approaching but at a safe distance (4.88m) and slow relative velocity (-0.92 m/s).  The lateral motion trend shows the lateral distance is decreasing but not rapidly enough to be a high risk. Risk assessment: Negligible Risk (5).

* **Obstacle 30665 (Front):** This obstacle is far ahead (24.21m) and moving further away longitudinally. Although it's slightly off-center, it's not a concern, and the overall motion indicates a diverging path. Risk assessment: Negligible Risk (5).

* **Obstacle 30666 (Left):** This obstacle is longitudinally aligned (0.00m) and poses no risk in that dimension, as confirmed by the motion description.  Laterally, it is relatively close (2.00m) and moving closer (-4.15 m/s).  Given the lateral distance and the closing velocity, this presents a medium risk. TTC = 2.00m / 4.15m/s ≈ 0.48s. MDC ≈ 2.00m. This obstacle is considered a high risk due to its low TTC. Risk assessment: High Risk (2).

* **Obstacle 30667 (Front-Left):** This obstacle is the closest longitudinally (1.81m) and approaching (-6.54 m/s). It's also laterally offset (7.74m), but the primary concern is longitudinal. TTC = 1.81m / 6.54m/s ≈ 0.28s. MDC ≈ 1.81m. This obstacle is a extreme risk due to the low TTC and MDC. Risk assessment: Extreme Risk (1).

* **Obstacle 30668 (Rear-Right):** This obstacle is behind the ego vehicle and moving further away longitudinally. The lateral distance and slightly negative longitudinal distance are not a concern. Overall, this is poses no risk to the ego car. Risk assessment: Negligible Risk (5).

* **Obstacle 30670 (Front-Left):** This obstacle is at a medium distance longitudinally (13.56m) and closing (-8.52 m/s), but its lateral offset is substantial.  While approaching, there's ample time to react, and it's not considered an immediate threat. TTC = 13.56m / 8.52m/s ≈ 1.59s. MDC ≈ 8.60m. Risk assessment: Medium Risk (3).

* **Obstacle 30675 (Rear-Right):** This obstacle is well behind and moving further away.  The lateral motion is minimal and not a concern. Risk assessment: Negligible Risk (5).

* **Obstacle 30677 (Behind):**  This obstacle is behind the ego vehicle and moving further away.  The exact lateral alignment is not a concern, and there's no collision risk. Risk assessment: Negligible Risk (5).
