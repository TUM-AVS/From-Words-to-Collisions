Let's delve into the details and conduct a comprehensive analysis based on the latest timestep (3.6 seconds) for each obstacle by considering their adjusted distances and motion data:

### Obstacle 30664 Analysis:
- **Location**: Rear-left of the ego car.
- **Adjusted Distances**: Longitudinal = -20.30m, Lateral = 4.88m.
- **Velocity**: Longitudinal = -14.53 m/s (moving away), Lateral = -0.92 m/s (moving towards).
- **Trajectory Analysis**: The obstacle is steadily moving away longitudinally, reducing risk despite the lateral closeness. Over time, the lateral distance has been increasing slightly, decreasing immediate risk from the side approach.
- **TTC Calculations**:
  - Longitudinal: Not applicable due to negative velocity (moving away).
  - Lateral: TTC = 4.88m / 0.92 m/s = 5.30s.
- **MDC Consideration**: Based on current movement trajectory, the obstacle is diverging, reducing MDC risk.
- **Risk Assessment**: Risk score of 5 (Negligible Risk).

### Obstacle 30665 Analysis:
- **Location**: Front of the ego car.
- **Adjusted Distances**: Longitudinal = 24.21m, Lateral = 0.00m.
- **Velocity**: Longitudinal = 7.05 m/s (moving away), Lateral = 1.32 m/s.
- **Trajectory Analysis**: This obstacle is moving away from the ego car, increasing the longitudinal distance over time, resulting in a negligible collision risk.
- **TTC Calculations**: TTC is not applicable due to the obstacle moving away.
- **MDC Consideration**: No closing trajectory present.
- **Risk Assessment**: Risk score of 5 (Negligible Risk).

### Obstacle 30666 Analysis:
- **Location**: Left of the ego car.
- **Adjusted Distances**: Longitudinal = 0.00m, Lateral = 2.00m.
- **Velocity**: Longitudinal = -1.57 m/s (moving away), Lateral = -4.15 m/s (closing).
- **Trajectory Analysis**: The obstacle is longitudinally aligned but moving away. However, the quick lateral closing distance indicates a significant risk.
- **TTC Calculations**: Lateral: TTC = 2.00m / 4.15 m/s = 0.48s.
- **MDC Consideration**: Lateral closure is nearing critical levels.
- **Risk Assessment**: Risk score of 1 (Extreme Risk).

### Obstacle 30667 Analysis:
- **Location**: Front-left of the ego car.
- **Adjusted Distances**: Longitudinal = 1.81m, Lateral = 7.74m.
- **Velocity**: Longitudinal = -6.54 m/s (closing), Lateral = -0.11 m/s.
- **Trajectory Analysis**: The obstacle is primarily closing longitudinally.
- **TTC Calculations**: Longitudinal: TTC = 1.81m / 6.54 m/s = 0.28s.
- **MDC Consideration**: Lateral impact minimized given inertia but significant longitudinal closure.
- **Risk Assessment**: Risk score of 1 (Extreme Risk).

### Obstacle 30668 Analysis:
- **Location**: Rear-right of the ego car.
- **Adjusted Distances**: Longitudinal = -5.41m, Lateral = -1.97m.
- **Velocity**: Longitudinal = -5.05 m/s (moving away).
- **Trajectory Analysis**: Diverging longitudinally, alleviating risk.
- **TTC Calculations**: Not applicable as both longitudinal and lateral movements diverge.
- **MDC Consideration**: Consistent movement away.
- **Risk Assessment**: Risk score of 5 (Negligible Risk).

### Obstacle 30670 Analysis:
- **Location**: Front-left of the ego car.
- **Adjusted Distances**: Longitudinal = 13.56m, Lateral = 8.60m.
- **Velocity**: Longitudinal = -8.52 m/s (closing), Lateral = -0.25 m/s.
- **Trajectory Analysis**: Closing longitudinally, but given the substantial distance, no immediate risk.
- **TTC Calculations**: Longitudinal: TTC = 13.56m / 8.52 m/s = 1.59s.
- **MDC Consideration**: Longitudinal trajectory primarily determines stability.
- **Risk Assessment**: Risk score of 3 (Medium Risk).

### Obstacle 30675 Analysis:
- **Location**: Rear-right of the ego car.
- **Adjusted Distances**: Longitudinal = -15.21m, Lateral = -2.75m.
- **Velocity**: Longitudinal = -2.95 m/s (moving away).
- **Trajectory Analysis**: Divergent trajectory, mainly moving away.
- **TTC Calculations**: Not applicable for each direction.
- **MDC Consideration**: Diverting lateral paths.
- **Risk Assessment**: Risk score of 5 (Negligible Risk).

### Obstacle 30677 Analysis:
- **Location**: Behind of the ego car.
- **Adjusted Distances**: Longitudinal = -16.21m, Lateral = 0.00m.
- **Velocity**: Longitudinal = -2.44 m/s (moving away).
- **Trajectory Analysis**: Not creating collision risk.
- **TTC Calculations**: Not applicable.
- **MDC Consideration**: No closing action.
- **Risk Assessment**: Risk score of 5 (Negligible Risk).
