At t=3.8s, Ego (30673.0) is at (278.9684, -184.6813) with velocity 4.3603 m/s.  Obstacle 30668.0 is stationary at (273.1457, -194.6046). The y-coordinates suggest Ego and Obstacle 30668.0 are in different lanes, but the x-coordinate difference of ~5.8m is small enough to be concerning given the recent timesteps show Ego's x-coordinate increasing while its velocity decreases. While not an immediate collision, the rapidly decreasing velocity of the Ego vehicle, coupled with the close proximity of the static obstacle, raises serious concerns.  This warrants an "Extreme Risk" assessment.  No other obstacles present immediate collision risks at this timestep.

    "Reasoning": "Ego (30673.0) is approaching static Obstacle 30668.0 rapidly while Ego's velocity is decreasing.  The x-coordinate difference is small (~5.8m) suggesting a possible lane change maneuver by Ego, but with the decreasing velocity, a collision is likely if Ego continues on its current trajectory."
