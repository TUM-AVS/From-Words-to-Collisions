At t=3.8s, obstacle 30668 is stationary and closest to the ego vehicle.  The positions (Ego: (278.9684, -184.6813), Obstacle 30668: (273.1457, -194.6046)) suggest proximity, and the ego vehicle's continued movement in its current direction might lead to a collision given the small lateral distance and the ego vehicle's changing orientation. Other obstacles are further away and their trajectories don't suggest an immediate collision risk within this single timestep.
