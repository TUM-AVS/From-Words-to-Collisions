### Obstacle Analysis:

#### Obstacle ID: 30664
- **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is consistently far from the ego vehicle, and their paths do not seem to intersect at any point. Over time, obstacle 30664 has been steadily moving away from the ego vehicle direction.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: The obstacle is on a different trajectory with relatively high speed but moving further from the ego. Trends show continued divergence.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 30665
- **Distance Risk reason**: This obstacle is further away from the ego vehicle. It is oriented such that it continues to increase the distance between itself and the ego vehicle.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: Traveling at high speed, but again in a different lane and moving away, reducing any potential impact risks.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 30666
- **Distance Risk reason**: It is moving parallel to the ego vehicle in a nearby lane; however, it maintains a safe distance with no intention of moving towards the ego vehicle.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: Modest and consistent speed with no sudden acceleration/deceleration patterns; trajectory doesn't suggest an imminent collision.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 30667
- **Distance Risk reason**: Very close in proximity to the ego vehicle; its slow speed and almost halting movement pose a near-collision threat if the ego vehicle swerves slightly.
- **Distance safety score**: 2
- **Time Risk reason**: Extremely slow deceleration with a tendency to stop means a potential obstacle in the ego's path.
- **Time safety score**: 1
- **Overall Risk score**: 1

#### Obstacle ID: 30668
- **Distance Risk reason**: Stationary throughout. Located away from the typical path of ego and not in a collision trajectory.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: No movement; thus, no collision risk stemming from stationary status.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 30670
- **Distance Risk reason**: Maintains a parallel trajectory with reasonable separation. Continuous speed reduction further lowers collision threat.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: Adequate velocity reduction trend adding distance over time.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 30675
- **Distance Risk reason**: Consistent path away from ego suggests no imminent risk despite relative proximity.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: Modest speed decrease underscoring reduced risk interaction.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 30677
- **Distance Risk reason**: Presence in the far lane suggests minimal collision possibility, maintaining a steady, safe distance.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: Gradual deceleration trend shows continued safe divergence with no acceleration spikes towards ego.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
- **Scenario Evaluation**: No immediate collision risk detected for the majority of obstacles, except 30667 which presents an extreme risk due to proximity and reduction in velocity.
- **Conclusion**: Given that obstacle 30667 is the only potential extreme threat without indicating a certain collision, the scenario does not suggest a colliding scenario overall.
