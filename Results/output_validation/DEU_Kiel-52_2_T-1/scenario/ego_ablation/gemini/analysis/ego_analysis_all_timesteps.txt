Obstacle 30666 is the closest obstacle laterally to the ego vehicle at 1.39 meters, and thus represents the most immediate collision risk. Although the longitudinal velocity is minimal, the lateral motion suggests it is moving into the ego vehicle's path.  Obstacle 30667 is also quite close longitudinally at 0.95 meters, but it is further away laterally at 7.53 meters. The rapid acceleration and longitudinal velocity suggest the time to collision is very short.

    "IsCollisionScenario": false,
    "Reasoning": "Obstacle 30667 poses an extreme risk with a very low longitudinal distance (0.95m) and a high closing velocity (-4.74 m/s). While not a guaranteed collision in the next timestep, the risk is imminent, warranting an overall risk score of 1. Although Obstacle 30666 is very close laterally (1.39m), the small longitudinal velocity (-0.21m/s) suggests it is less of an immediate threat than 30667 at this specific moment. Since no obstacle has an overall risk score of 0, it's not a collision scenario yet."
