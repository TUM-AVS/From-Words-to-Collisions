At timestamp 3.8 seconds, Obstacle 30667 is the highest risk obstacle. It's located in the Front-left of the ego vehicle at a longitudinal distance of 0.95 meters and a lateral distance of 7.53 meters.  Its longitudinal relative velocity indicates it is moving towards the ego car at -4.74 m/s. Given the short distance and the closing velocity, this obstacle presents a high risk of collision if the ego vehicle does not take evasive action. No obstacle shows an immediate or unavoidable collision.


**Risk Levels and Definitions:**
<Collision (Score: 0)>: Actual collision has occurred or is unavoidable within the next timestep.
<Extreme Risk (Score: 1)>: Immediate collision or very high likelihood of impact. Urgent action is required.
<High Risk (Score: 2)>: Close to collision or highly probable collision path. Needs prompt attention and quick manoeuvring.
<Medium Risk (Score: 3)>: Moderate collision risk but manageable with timely reactions and proper strategies.
<Low Risk (Score: 4)>: Minimal collision risk. The situation is controllable with sufficient time to react.
<Negligible Risk (Score: 5)>: No significant collision risk. Obstacles are either moving away or far enough not to interfere.
