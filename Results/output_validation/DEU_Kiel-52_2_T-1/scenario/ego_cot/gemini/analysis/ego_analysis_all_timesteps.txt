### Safety analysis for timestep 2.9s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 30664
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is behind the ego vehicle and moving away longitudinally, posing no immediate longitudinal risk. Lateral distance is significant, and although moving towards the ego vehicle, it's not an immediate threat.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Moving away longitudinally, indicating no longitudinal collision risk. Lateral movement towards ego vehicle suggests a potential risk, but not imminent.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- Obstacle ID: 30665
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is far ahead and moving further away longitudinally, indicating no risk.  Lateral distance is large.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason:  Moving away longitudinally and no lateral relative velocity info.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 30666
- Distance Risk reason: Zero distance in both longitudinal and lateral directions indicates a collision.
- Distance safety score: 0
- Time Risk reason: Zero distance implies zero time to collision.
- Time safety score: 0
- Overall Risk score: 0

- Obstacle ID: 30667
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is relatively close and approaching longitudinally, creating a high risk. Lateral motion towards the ego further increases the concern.
- Distance safety score: 2
- Time Risk reason:  Closing velocity longitudinally combined with proximity suggests high risk. Lateral motion makes collision very probable.
- Time safety score: 2
- Overall Risk score: 2

- Obstacle ID: 30668
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is very close behind and moving away longitudinally, which lessens the longitudinal risk. However, the small lateral distance is concerning.
- Distance safety score: 2
- Time Risk reason:  Moving away longitudinally reduces collision risk. No lateral relative motion implies current lateral distance stays constant for the moment. 
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3

- Obstacle ID: 30670
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is relatively far and poses minimal immediate threat.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason:  Closing velocity longitudinally warrants attention.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3

- Obstacle ID: 30675
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is behind and moving further away, lowering collision risk. Lateral movement towards the ego warrants attention.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason:  Moving away longitudinally signifies reduced risk.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- Obstacle ID: 30677
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is behind and moving further away longitudinally, decreasing risk. Lateral movement towards the ego requires monitoring.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason:  Moving away longitudinally indicates reduced risk.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4



### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
    "CollisionObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "30666",
        "OverallRiskScore": "0"
    },
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null,
    "IsCollisionScenario": true,
    "Justification": "Obstacle 30666 has zero distance to ego vehicle in both longitudinal and lateral directions, indicating a collision."
}
```

(Analysis for timesteps 3.0s to 3.8s would follow the same format, evaluating each obstacle based on provided data and updating the JSON summary accordingly. Given that obstacle 30666 continues to have 0 distance at 3.0s and subsequent timestamps and other obstacles maintain similar risk levels with no new extreme or collision risks, the JSON output for these timesteps would likely stay consistent.)
