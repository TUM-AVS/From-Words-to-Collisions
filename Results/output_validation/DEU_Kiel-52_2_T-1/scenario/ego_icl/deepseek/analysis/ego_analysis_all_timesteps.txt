Let me analyze the most recent timestep (3.8 seconds) for collision risks:

### Obstacle-by-Obstacle Analysis:

1. **Obstacle 30664 (Rear-left)**
   - Distance: Longitudinal -23.03m, Lateral 5.58m
   - Velocity: Longitudinal -14.15 m/s (moving away), Lateral -0.63 m/s (slowly approaching)
   - MDC: Lateral distance >5m → No Risk (5)
   - TTC: Not applicable (moving away longitudinally)
   - **Overall Risk: 5 (No Risk)**

2. **Obstacle 30666 (Left)**
   - Distance: Longitudinal 0.00m (aligned), Lateral 1.39m
   - Velocity: Lateral -3.47 m/s (approaching rapidly)
   - MDC: 1.39m → Medium Risk (3)
   - TTC: 1.39/3.47 = 0.4s → Extreme Risk (1)
   - **Overall Risk: 1 (Extreme Risk)** - Rapid lateral approach with very small distance

3. **Obstacle 30667 (Front-left)**
   - Distance: Longitudinal 0.95m, Lateral 7.53m
   - Velocity: Longitudinal -4.74 m/s (approaching), Lateral -0.02 m/s (negligible)
   - MDC: 0.95m → High Risk (2)
   - TTC: 0.95/4.74 = 0.2s → Extreme Risk (1)
   - **Overall Risk: 1 (Extreme Risk)** - Very close longitudinal approach

4. **Obstacle 30668 (Rear-right)**
   - Distance: Longitudinal -6.53m, Lateral -1.63m
   - Velocity: Longitudinal -4.36 m/s (moving away)
   - MDC: 1.63m → Medium Risk (3)
   - TTC: Not applicable (moving away)
   - **Overall Risk: 3 (Medium Risk)**

5. **Obstacle 30670 (Front-left)**
   - Distance: Longitudinal 12.24m, Lateral 7.99m
   - Velocity: Longitudinal -7.39 m/s (approaching)
   - MDC: 7.99m → No Risk (5)
   - TTC: 12.24/7.39 = 1.66s → Medium Risk (3)
   - **Overall Risk: 3 (Medium Risk)**

6. **Obstacle 30675 (Rear-right)**
   - Distance: Longitudinal -15.97m, Lateral -2.08m
   - Velocity: Longitudinal -2.55 m/s (moving away)
   - MDC: 2.08m → Medium Risk (3)
   - TTC: Not applicable (moving away)
   - **Overall Risk: 3 (Medium Risk)**

7. **Obstacle 30677 (Behind)**
   - Distance: Longitudinal -16.76m, Lateral 0.00m
   - Velocity: Longitudinal -2.13 m/s (moving away)
   - MDC: >5m → No Risk (5)
   - TTC: Not applicable
   - **Overall Risk: 5 (No Risk)**

### Trajectory Analysis:
- Obstacle 30666 shows consistent lateral approach from left (distance decreasing from 4.67m to 1.39m over 0.9s)
- Obstacle 30667 shows rapid longitudinal approach (distance decreasing from 7.63m to 0.95m)
- All other obstacles are either maintaining or increasing distance

### Critical Findings:
- Two obstacles (30666 and 30667) show Extreme Risk (score 1)
- Obstacle 30667 is particularly dangerous with only 0.95m longitudinal distance and closing at 4.74 m/s
- Obstacle 30666 has critical lateral proximity (1.39m) closing at 3.47 m/s

    },
    "IsCollisionScenario": true,
    "Justification": "Two obstacles (30666 and 30667) show Extreme Risk (score 1). Obstacle 30667 has only 0.95m longitudinal distance closing at 4.74 m/s (TTC=0.2s), while 30666 has 1.39m lateral distance closing at 3.47 m/s (TTC=0.4s). Both represent imminent collision threats."
