* **Obstacle 30664 (Rear-Left):**  This obstacle is moving away longitudinally and has a significant lateral distance.  Over the past few timesteps, its longitudinal distance has been increasing, indicating diverging paths. The lateral distance is decreasing slightly, but not rapidly enough to pose an immediate threat.
    * **Risk Assessment:** Low Risk (4) due to lateral motion, but receding longitudinally.

* **Obstacle 30666 (Left):** This obstacle has exact longitudinal alignment (0.00m) with the ego vehicle, but is laterally separated by 1.39m. The lateral distance is decreasing.  This situation requires careful monitoring. Since it is approaching from the left side, the longitudinal alignment is less concerning, unless very close laterally. The key metric here is lateral motion.
    * **Risk Assessment:** Medium Risk (3) due to decreasing lateral distance and longitudinal alignment.

* **Obstacle 30667 (Front-Left):** The longitudinal distance to this obstacle is only 0.95m, and the lateral distance is decreasing. The longitudinal distance is rapidly decreasing across the timesteps, indicating high risk.
    * **Risk Assessment:** Extreme Risk (1) due to very close longitudinal distance with converging trajectories. This is potentially a collision scenario.

* **Obstacle 30668 (Rear-Right):** The longitudinal distance of this obstacle is negative and increasing in magnitude, meaning it's moving further behind the ego vehicle. The lateral distance is also non-zero.  There is no risk of collision.
    * **Risk Assessment:** No Risk (5)

* **Obstacle 30670 (Front-Left):** This obstacle is diagonally in front of the ego vehicle. While the distances are not extremely close, they are decreasing across timesteps, indicating a potential risk.
    * **Risk Assessment:** Medium Risk (3) because distances are decreasing, but not immediately threatening.

* **Obstacle 30675 (Rear-Right):**  This obstacle is moving away longitudinally and the lateral distance is not extremely close and is decreasing. No immediate risk.
    * **Risk Assessment:** No Risk (5)

* **Obstacle 30677 (Behind):** This obstacle is behind the ego vehicle and its distance is increasing over time. No collision risk.
    * **Risk Assessment:** No Risk (5)

**Collision Scenario Determination:** Yes, this is a collision scenario. Obstacle 30667 poses an Extreme Risk (1) due to its close proximity (0.95m) and rapid approach towards the ego vehicle longitudinally.
