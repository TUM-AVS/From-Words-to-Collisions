Based on the scenario context provided, let's evaluate the collision risks for each obstacle at the most recent timestamp (3.8 seconds), using the adjusted distances and other relevant data.

#### Obstacle Analysis at 3.8 Seconds:

1. **Obstacle 30664 (Rear-left)**
   - **Adjusted Distances**: Longitudinal -23.03m, Lateral 5.58m
   - **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal -14.15 m/s, Lateral -0.63 m/s
   - **MDC Calculation**: None required since it's moving away longitudinally with increasing distance.
   - **TTC Calculation**: Not applicable as the obstacle is moving away.
   - **Risk Assessment**: No Risk (5). The obstacle is moving away, and there are no indications of convergence.

2. **Obstacle 30666 (Left)**
   - **Adjusted Distances**: Longitudinal 0.00m, Lateral 1.39m
   - **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal -0.21 m/s, Lateral -3.47 m/s
   - **MDC Calculation**: Lateral position is decreasing, indicating a closing lateral distance.
   - **TTC Calculation**: Lateral TTC = 1.39m / 3.47m/s ≈ 0.40s
   - **Risk Assessment**: Extreme Risk (1). The lateral TTC is very low with closing velocity.

3. **Obstacle 30667 (Front-left)**
   - **Adjusted Distances**: Longitudinal 0.95m, Lateral 7.53m
   - **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal -4.74 m/s, Lateral -0.02 m/s
   - **MDC Calculation**: Longitudinal distance is very close but moving away; lateral position stable.
   - **TTC Calculation**: Longitudinal (approaching): TTC = 0.95m / 4.74m/s ≈ 0.20s
   - **Risk Assessment**: Extreme Risk (1). The longitudinal TTC is very low with converging trajectory.

4. **Obstacle 30668 (Rear-right)**
   - **Adjusted Distances**: Longitudinal -6.53m, Lateral -1.63m
   - **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal -4.36 m/s, No lateral motion
   - **MDC Calculation**: Moving away in both dimensions.
   - **TTC Calculation**: Not applicable as it's moving away.
   - **Risk Assessment**: No Risk (5). The obstacle is moving away.

5. **Obstacle 30670 (Front-left)**
   - **Adjusted Distances**: Longitudinal 12.24m, Lateral 7.99m
   - **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal -7.39 m/s, Lateral -0.12 m/s
   - **MDC Calculation**: Paths are converging slowly, but not immediate.
   - **TTC Calculation**: Longitudinal TTC = 12.24m / 7.39m/s ≈ 1.66s
   - **Risk Assessment**: Medium Risk (3). Moderate risk due to convergence but not immediate.

6. **Obstacle 30675 (Rear-right)**
   - **Adjusted Distances**: Longitudinal -15.97m, Lateral -2.08m
   - **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal -2.55 m/s, Lateral motion toward ego
   - **MDC Calculation**: Increasing both longitudinal and lateral positions, moving away.
   - **TTC Calculation**: Not applicable as it is not closing enough.
   - **Risk Assessment**: No Risk (5). Moving away in both dimensions.

7. **Obstacle 30677 (Behind)**
   - **Adjusted Distances**: Longitudinal -16.76m, Lateral 0.00m
   - **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal -2.13 m/s
   - **MDC Calculation**: None needed, paths diverging.
   - **TTC Calculation**: Not applicable, stable path.
   - **Risk Assessment**: No Risk (5). Steadily moving away.

#### Overall Assessment:
- Obstacle 30666 poses an Extreme Risk due to its rapidly closing lateral distance.
- Obstacle 30667 poses an Extreme Risk in both lateral and longitudinal dimensions, albeit slightly lower.
- No obstacle has a collision currently (score of 0), but the low TTC values for these two obstacles indicate imminent collision paths if unaddressed.

Given the extreme risks associated with obstacles 30666 and 30667, this qualifies as a collision scenario, especially focusing on closing distances and the convergence of paths.
