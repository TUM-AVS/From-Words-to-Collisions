    - Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 1
    - Lateral Distance Safety Score: 5
    - Overall Distance Safety Score: 3
    - Time Risk Reason: TTClong is 0.20s indicating an extreme longitudinal collision risk. TTClat is 470.93s suggesting no lateral risk.
    - Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 1
    - Lateral Time Safety Score: 5
    - Overall Time Safety Score: 3
    - Overall Risk Score: 3

    - Obstacle ID: 30668
    - Relative Direction: Rear-right
    - Distance Risk Reason: DTClong is -6.53m and DTClat is -1.63m indicating a very low risk longitudinally. Negative values suggest the obstacle is behind the ego vehicle. The trends over several timesteps show the obstacle moving away longitudinally and laterally away from the ego vehicle. 
    - Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 5
    - Lateral Distance Safety Score: 3
    - Overall Distance Safety Score: 4
    - Time Risk Reason:  Both TTClong and TTClat are inf, further confirming a negligible collision risk.
    - Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 5
    - Lateral Time Safety Score: 5
    - Overall Time Safety Score: 5
    - Overall Risk Score: 5


    - Obstacle ID: 30670
    - Relative Direction: Front-left
    - Distance Risk Reason: DTClong is 12.24m and DTClat is 7.99m. Both values indicate relative safety. The obstacle has maintained some distance from the ego vehicle throughout the previous time steps.
    - Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 5
    - Lateral Distance Safety Score: 5
    - Overall Distance Safety Score: 5
    - Time Risk Reason: TTClong is 1.66s and TTClat is 67.34s. This indicates a medium longitudinal risk and a low risk laterally.
    - Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 3
    - Lateral Time Safety Score: 5
    - Overall Time Safety Score: 4
    - Overall Risk Score: 5

    - Obstacle ID: 30675
    - Relative Direction: Rear-right
    - Distance Risk Reason: DTClong is -15.97m indicating it is far behind and DTClat is -2.08m. Negative values suggest the obstacle is behind and to the side of the ego vehicle. Over the past few timesteps, it has been consistently moving away longitudinally.
    - Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 5
    - Lateral Distance Safety Score: 3
    - Overall Distance Safety Score: 4
    - Time Risk Reason: TTClong is inf and TTClat is 24.44s, indicating no immediate risk of collision. 
    - Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 5
    - Lateral Time Safety Score: 5
    - Overall Time Safety Score: 5
    - Overall Risk Score: 5

    - Obstacle ID: 30677
    - Relative Direction: Behind
    - Distance Risk Reason: DTClong is -16.76m and DTClat is 0.0m meaning it is directly behind the ego vehicle. The negative DTClong indicates that it is located behind the ego vehicle. The distance has been consistently increasing.
    - Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 5
    - Lateral Distance Safety Score: 0
    - Overall Distance Safety Score: 5
    - Time Risk Reason: TTClong is inf and TTClat is 0.0s. The obstacle poses no longitudinal collision risk as it moves away. There's no lateral risk given the exact alignment and lack of lateral relative motion.
    - Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 5
    - Lateral Time Safety Score: 0
    - Overall Time Safety Score: 5
    - Overall Risk Score: 5
