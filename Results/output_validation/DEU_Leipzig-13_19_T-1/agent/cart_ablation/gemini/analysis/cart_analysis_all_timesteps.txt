Obstacle 3243:  This obstacle is located in a different lanelet (198) than the ego vehicle (1126), and their y-coordinates are significantly different.  The obstacle also comes to a complete stop. It poses no immediate risk. Risk score: 5

Obstacle 3244: This obstacle is located in a different lanelet (667) than the ego vehicle (1126), and their y-coordinates are significantly different. Although it has a high velocity, it's moving away from the ego vehicle. Risk score: 5

Obstacle 3247: This obstacle is located in a different lanelet (198) than the ego vehicle (1126), and while their y-coordinates were initially close, they are diverging as the obstacle's y-coordinate increases.  Risk score: 5

Obstacle 3249: This obstacle is in a neighboring lanelet (1125) and its y-coordinate and orientation are very close to the ego vehicle's. Over the provided timesteps, its x-coordinate gets significantly closer to the ego vehicle's. Although a collision hasn't happened yet, the trajectories suggest a very high risk of a near-term collision. Risk score: 1.

Obstacle 3253: This obstacle is stationary and located in a different lanelet (668) with a significantly different y-coordinate. It presents no risk. Risk score: 5

Obstacle 3254: This obstacle is in the same lanelet (1126) as the ego vehicle. It is behind the ego vehicle and moving slower, so there is no collision risk. Risk score: 5

Obstacle 3255: This obstacle is in the same lanelet (1126) as the ego vehicle, but further ahead.  The data shows it moving away from the ego vehicle, so it presents no risk. Risk score: 5
