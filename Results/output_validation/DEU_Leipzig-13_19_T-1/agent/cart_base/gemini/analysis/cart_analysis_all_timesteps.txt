Obstacle 3243: This obstacle is in a different lanelet (198) than the ego vehicle (1126), and its velocity decreases to 0 over the observed time steps, ultimately stopping.  The y-coordinate difference suggests it poses no immediate threat. Risk score: 5

Obstacle 3244: This obstacle is also in a different lanelet (667) and moving with a high velocity away from the ego vehicle.  The large y-coordinate difference and its movement pattern indicate no risk of collision. Risk score: 5

Obstacle 3247: Similar to 3243, this obstacle is in lanelet 198, a different lanelet from the ego vehicle. Although its velocity initially increases slightly, it also appears to be decelerating, reducing the risk. Risk score: 4

Obstacle 3249: This obstacle is in lanelet 1125, adjacent to the ego vehicle's lanelet (1126). Its x-coordinate and orientation suggest it is moving in roughly the same direction as the ego vehicle.  However, the y-coordinate separation and the decelerating trend indicate a low chance of collision. Risk score: 4


Obstacle 3253: This stationary obstacle is in lanelet 668, with a significant difference in the y-coordinate compared to the ego vehicle, eliminating collision risk. Risk score: 5

Obstacle 3254: This obstacle shares the same lanelet (1126) as the ego vehicle and is moving in the same direction. Its x-coordinate shows it's behind the ego vehicle but its approaching gradually. The consistently decreasing velocity and the significant distance at the last time step suggest only a medium risk. Risk score: 3

Obstacle 3255: Also in the same lanelet (1126) as the ego vehicle. The x position is significantly behind the ego. Therefore, the risk of collision is low despite being in the same lane. Risk score: 4
