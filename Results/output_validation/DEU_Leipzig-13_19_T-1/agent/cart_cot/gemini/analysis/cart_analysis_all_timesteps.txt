Obstacle 3249 shows a concerning trend.  While not immediately colliding, its trajectory suggests a potential collision with the ego vehicle within the next few seconds as it is changing lanes into the ego vehicle's lane. This warrants a high-risk assessment. Other obstacles maintain a safe distance and trajectory for now.
