### Analysis

For the last timestep (4.0 seconds), I analyzed each obstacle's trajectory and its potential threat to the Ego vehicle within its lanelet and path. Here's the assessment based on distances, velocities, and the trajectory path:

1. **Obstacle 3247.0**: Located at (-410.5634, -38.4011) and is moving at 6.1032 m/s with a deceleration trend. This obstacle is on a different lanelet (198.0), though approaching the ego vehicle's path. Given its deceleration and path deviation, it holds only a Medium or High Risk.

2. **Obstacle 3249.0**: At (-422.9357, -25.9073), moving at a higher speed of 7.2714 m/s and showing consistent acceleration. It's in lanelet 1125.0, close to Ego's lanelet 1126.0. Given its relative velocity and proximity, assisted by constant velocity increase, it's categorized as High Risk because it could potentially move ahead or enter into Ego's path at a higher speed.

3. **Obstacle 3255.0** resides in lanelet 1126.0 with Ego, moving at 7.672 m/s at position (-449.0082, -36.7914). It’s relatively further in position but shares the same lanelet. Despite its negative acceleration, given the shared lanelet, it has a higher risk but remains manageable due to deceleration, indicating possible High or Medium Risk.

4. **Obstacle 3243.0** remains stationary (0 m/s) at (-418.2099, -53.4242), with no risk of collision or movement into Ego’s lanelet.

5. **Obstacle 3253.0** is also stationary, has shown no movement or acceleration trends, maintaining negligible risk given its substantial distance and lack of velocity.

### Conclusion

In this assessment, I identified:
- No immediate collision risks requiring an Overall Risk Score of 0.
- Obstacle 3249.0 as the most concerning with a High Risk Score due to potential path encroachment and acceleration.
- No Extreme Risk Obstacle since none show an immediate intention or capacity to collide directly given current trajectory trends.
