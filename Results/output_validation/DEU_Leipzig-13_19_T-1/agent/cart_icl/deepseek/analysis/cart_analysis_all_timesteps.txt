### Analysis:

1. **Obstacle 3249**:
   - **Position**: (-422.9357, -25.9073) at 4.0s, moving towards ego.
   - **Relative Motion**: Ego is at (-427.7146, -31.2816), obstacle is ahead and to the right.
   - **Velocity**: Obstacle velocity is 7.2714 m/s, ego velocity is 1.9685 m/s.
   - **TTC**: Distance ~5.5m, relative velocity ~5.3 m/s → TTC ~1.04s.
   - **Lateral Distance**: ~5.4m (safe).
   - **Risk**: **Medium (3)** due to high relative velocity but safe lateral distance.

2. **Obstacle 3254**:
   - **Position**: (-433.1163, -32.8844) at 4.0s, same lanelet as ego (1126.0).
   - **Relative Motion**: Ego is at (-427.7146, -31.2816), obstacle is behind and slightly to the left.
   - **Velocity**: Obstacle velocity is 6.779 m/s, ego velocity is 1.9685 m/s.
   - **TTC**: Distance ~5.5m, relative velocity ~4.8 m/s → TTC ~1.15s.
   - **Lateral Distance**: ~1.6m (close).
   - **Risk**: **High (2)** due to proximity and same lanelet.

3. **Obstacle 3247**:
   - **Position**: (-410.5634, -38.4011) at 4.0s, lanelet 198.0 (adjacent to ego's lanelet).
   - **Relative Motion**: Ego is at (-427.7146, -31.2816), obstacle is ahead and to the left.
   - **Velocity**: Obstacle velocity is 6.1032 m/s, ego velocity is 1.9685 m/s.
   - **TTC**: Distance ~17.5m, relative velocity ~4.1 m/s → TTC ~4.27s.
   - **Lateral Distance**: ~7.1m (safe).
   - **Risk**: **Low (4)** due to large distance and safe lateral separation.

4. **Obstacle 3253**:
   - **Position**: (-432.8601, -58.7855) at 4.0s, stationary.
   - **Relative Motion**: Ego is at (-427.7146, -31.2816), obstacle is far behind and to the left.
   - **Velocity**: 0 m/s.
   - **TTC**: Not applicable (stationary and far).
   - **Lateral Distance**: ~27.5m (safe).
   - **Risk**: **Negligible (5)**.

### Highest Risks:
- **Obstacle 3254**: High risk due to proximity and same lanelet.
