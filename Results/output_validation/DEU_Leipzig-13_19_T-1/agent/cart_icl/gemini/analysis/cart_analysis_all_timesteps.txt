Obstacle 3249 is showing concerning behavior.  It's in a neighboring lanelet and its lateral distance to the ego vehicle is decreasing, while its longitudinal velocity and acceleration fluctuate. Although a collision is not imminent in the next few seconds, the current trajectory suggests a potential lane change maneuver by obstacle 3249, posing a high risk to the ego vehicle if the obstacle doesn't yield appropriately.

Obstacle 3247 is moving in a different lanelet but has a decreasing longitudinal velocity and negative acceleration. While not immediately dangerous, the changing dynamics warrant attention and continuous monitoring in subsequent timesteps.
