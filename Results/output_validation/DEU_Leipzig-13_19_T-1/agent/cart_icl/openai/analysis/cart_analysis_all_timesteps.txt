To evaluate the scenario at the most recent timestep (4.0 seconds), we measure the risk based on proximity to the ego vehicle and relative motions to assess the relative risk level of each obstacle.

1. **Ego Vehicle**:
   - Position: (-427.7146, -31.2816)
   - Velocity: 1.9685 m/s

2. **Obstacle Analysis**:
   - **Obstacle 3243.0**:
     - Position: (-418.2099, -53.4242)
     - Velocity: 0 m/s (stationary)
     - Relative position: Approximated extremely far and not in direct path currently.
     - **Risk**: Low (4) – Stationary and far from ego's direct path.
   
   - **Obstacle 3247.0**:
     - Position: (-410.5634, -38.4011)
     - Velocity: 6.1032 m/s
     - Relative position: Approaching rapidly from ahead.
     - **Risk**: Medium Risk (3) – Further consideration needed for changes in paths.

   - **Obstacle 3249.0**:
     - Position: (-422.9357, -25.9073)
     - Velocity: 7.2714 m/s
     - Relative position: Somewhat parallel travel. Slightly ahead-left; closing distance.
     - **Risk**: Medium Risk (3) – Monitoring needed as closing distance.

   - **Obstacle 3253.0**:
     - Position: (-432.8601, -58.7855)
     - Velocity: 0 m/s (stationary)
     - Relative position: Further & stationary, not directly in path.
     - **Risk**: Negligible (5) – No movement detected.

   - **Obstacle 3254.0**:
     - Position: (-433.1163, -32.8844)
     - Velocity: 6.779 m/s
     - Relative position: Just behind the line of the ego in the same lanelet; closing.
     - **Risk**: High Risk (2) – Monitor as it's closing in, same lanelet, could approach rapidly.

   - **Obstacle 3255.0**:
     - Position: (-449.0082, -36.7914)
     - Velocity: 7.672 m/s
     - Relative position: Behind ego; faster velocity but slightly offset.
     - **Risk**: Medium Risk (3) – Further checks needed for direct path crossing.

In summary, the analysis shows a high risk concerning Obstacle 3254.0 due to its position and velocity relative to the ego vehicle.
