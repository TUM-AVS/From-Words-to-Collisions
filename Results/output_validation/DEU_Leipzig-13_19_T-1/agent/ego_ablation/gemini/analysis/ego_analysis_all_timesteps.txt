At timestamp 4.0 seconds, the ego vehicle faces potential risks from multiple obstacles.

* **Obstacle 3243:** Located to the right (lateral -22.38 m) with no longitudinal movement relative to the ego vehicle but moving slightly away laterally.  This poses no immediate risk. Proximity (5), MDC (5), TTC (5).

* **Obstacle 3247:** Located in the front-right (longitudinal 9.65 m, lateral -10.41 m) and moving towards the ego longitudinally.  Lateral movement suggests it might be turning. Given the distance and moderate closing speed, the risk is low. Proximity (4), MDC (4), TTC (4).

* **Obstacle 3249:** Located in the front-left (longitudinal 1.69 m, lateral 2.05 m). Although close longitudinally, it is moving away from the ego vehicle both longitudinally and laterally, therefore is not a high risk. Proximity (3), MDC (4), TTC (5).

* **Obstacle 3253:** Located to the rear-right and moving away from the ego vehicle.  No immediate risk. Proximity (5), MDC (5), TTC (5).

* **Obstacle 3254:** Located directly behind the ego vehicle (longitudinal -1.13 m) and approaching rapidly, based on the longitudinal distance and relative velocity. This presents a high risk of collision. Proximity (2), MDC (2), TTC (2).

* **Obstacle 3255:** Located behind the ego vehicle at a greater distance than obstacle 3254. It's approaching, but poses less of an immediate risk than 3254. This needs to be monitored but is not currently high risk. Proximity (4), MDC (4), TTC (4).
