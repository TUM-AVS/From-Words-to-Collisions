* **Obstacle 3243**: Located to the right of the ego vehicle, with no longitudinal movement relative to the ego vehicle.  Lateral velocity is also negligible.  This poses a low risk. Risk score: 4.
* **Obstacle 3247**: Located front-right, moving towards the ego vehicle longitudinally and laterally to the right. The distance is substantial and poses no immediate threat.  Risk score: 3.
* **Obstacle 3249**: Located front-left and moving away from the ego vehicle both longitudinally and laterally.  Risk score: 5.
* **Obstacle 3253**: Located rear-right and moving away from the ego vehicle longitudinally. No lateral movement. Risk score: 5.
* **Obstacle 3254**: Located behind the ego vehicle and approaching longitudinally. The longitudinal distance is small (-1.13m) and the relative velocity is high (4.80 m/s), indicating a very high risk of collision. Risk score: 1.
* **Obstacle 3255**: Located behind the ego vehicle and approaching longitudinally. Distance is greater than Obstacle 3254, representing a lower, but still notable risk.  Risk score: 2.
