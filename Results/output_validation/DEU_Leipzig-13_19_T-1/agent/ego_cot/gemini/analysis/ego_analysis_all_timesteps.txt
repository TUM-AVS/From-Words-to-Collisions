### Safety analysis for timestep 4.0s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

**Assumptions and Calculations:**

* To calculate TTC (Time to Collision), we'll use the following simplified formula: `TTC = Distance / Relative Velocity`.  If the relative velocity is positive (moving away), TTC will be considered a large positive value(10), indicating no immediate risk. Because a negative relative velocity while the distance is negative implies moving away from each other which has no risk of collision. We cannot give a specific value for the TTC calculation, but only relatively positive or negative to indicate the collision status. We will give an assumed value to denote the TTC calculation for relative velocity is positive while the distance is negative.
* For MDC (Minimum Distance to Collision), we will use the current distance as a proxy. A more sophisticated analysis would involve predicting trajectories, which isn't possible with the given information.
* We are assuming there are no ego vehicle maneuvers during this time frame.

### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 3243**
- Distance Risk reason: Located directly to the right of the ego vehicle (0.00m longitudinal and lateral displacement). This indicates an extremely close proximity.
- Distance safety score: 0
- Time Risk reason: Exact longitudinal alignment and slightly moving away laterally. Indicates a potential for lateral collision.
- Time safety score: 1
- Overall Risk score: 0 (due to the immediate lateral collision risk).

- **Obstacle ID: 3247**
- Distance Risk reason:  Located 9.65m longitudinally and laterally in the front-right. This represents a safe distance.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Moving towards the ego longitudinally and away laterally. TTC poses no immediate concern.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 3249**
- Distance Risk reason: Located 1.69m longitudinally and laterally in the front-left. This represents a moderately safe distance.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: Moving away from the ego both longitudinally and laterally.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 3

- **Obstacle ID: 3253**
- Distance Risk reason: Located -8.80m longitudinally and laterally behind-right. This represents a safe distance.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Moving away from the ego longitudinally. No lateral relative motion
- Time safety score: 10
- Overall Risk score: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 3254**
- Distance Risk reason: Located -1.13m longitudinally and laterally behind. This indicates high proximity.
- Distance safety score: 2
- Time Risk reason:  Moving towards the ego vehicle from behind. 
- Time safety score: 2
- Overall Risk score: 2

- **Obstacle ID: 3255**
- Distance Risk reason: Located -17.45m longitudinally and laterally behind. This represents a safe distance.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Although approaching from behind, the distance is sufficient at this point.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5
