### Obstacle-by-Obstacle Analysis

**Obstacle 3243:**
- **Position and Motion:** Currently aligned to the right of the ego vehicle with a longitudinal distance of 0.00m and a lateral distance of -22.38m. The obstacle is not moving closer laterally (relative velocity of 0.00m/s).
- **Trajectory Analysis:** Over time, this obstacle has maintained a consistent lateral distance while the longitudinal velocity component is minimal.
- **TTC & MDC:** Lateral distance is stable; due to a non-zero lateral distance and movement away, both TTC and MDC indicate no immediate risk.
- **Risk Analysis:** Negligible Risk.

**Obstacle 3247:**
- **Position and Motion:** In the front-right of the ego vehicle with a longitudinal distance of 9.65m and lateral distance of -10.41m. Driving towards the ego longitudinally and moving away laterally.
- **Trajectory Analysis:** Although approaching longitudinally, the lateral distance is increasing.
- **TTC & MDC:** Calculated TTC longitudinally is negative (higher velocity moving away laterally). MDC is well over 5 meters due to the increasing lateral distance.
- **Risk Analysis:** No Risk, as paths diverge.

**Obstacle 3249:**
- **Position and Motion:** On the front-left with an adjusted longitudinal distance of 1.69m and lateral distance of 2.05m. Obstacle is moving away on both axes.
- **Trajectory Analysis:** Paths are diverging with increasing distances in both dimensions.
- **TTC & MDC:** Resulting in a No Risk configuration as longitudinal and lateral velocities are moving apart.
- **Risk Analysis:** No Risk.

**Obstacle 3253:**
- **Position and Motion:** Situated in the rear-right with an adjusted longitudinal distance of -8.80m and lateral distance of -23.00m. Moving away longitudinally, with no lateral approach.
- **Trajectory Analysis:** Continuous movement away both longitudinally and laterally.
- **TTC & MDC:** Both values support diverging paths, ruling out collision.
- **Risk Analysis:** No Risk.

**Obstacle 3254:**
- **Position and Motion:** Behind the ego vehicle with an adjusted longitudinal distance of -1.13m and lateral distance of 0.00m. Driving towards longitudinally at 4.80m/s.
- **Trajectory Analysis:** The obstacle is too close and closing longitudinally. Critical alignment in both longitudinal distance and velocity.
- **TTC & MDC:** TTC is approximately 0.24s (1.13m / 4.80m/s), indicating Extreme Risk with an MDC below 0.5m.
- **Risk Analysis:** Extreme Risk, high potential for collision due to close distances and high approach speed.

**Obstacle 3255:**
- **Position and Motion:** Positioned behind with adjusted longitudinal distance of -17.45m and lateral distance of 0.00m. Approaching longitudinally at 5.67m/s.
- **Trajectory Analysis:** Approaching but at a greater distance.
- **TTC & MDC:** MDC calculated >5m due to large current distance, though the velocity indicates constant approach.
- **Risk Analysis:** Low Risk, with sufficient margins unless conditions change drastically.
