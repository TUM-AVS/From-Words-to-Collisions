At t=4.2s, Ego is in lanelet 1126.  Several obstacles are nearby, but only Obstacle 3249 poses a significant risk.

Obstacle 3249, located in lanelet 1125, is at (-421.5229, -25.3955) while Ego is at (-427.3398, -31.1585).  Although Obstacle 3249 is in the adjacent lanelet, the y-coordinate difference is only ~5.8, indicating proximity. Given Obstacle 3249's velocity of 7.6591 and its x-coordinate rapidly approaching Ego's, an immediate collision is highly likely if both vehicles maintain their current trajectories. Thus, Obstacle 3249 represents an Extreme Risk.

Other obstacles are not immediately risky.  Obstacle 3254 is in the same lanelet as Ego but sufficiently behind and decelerating. Obstacles 3243, 3247, and 3253 are stationary or in different lanelets with safe distances.  Obstacle 3255 is further down the same lanelet as Ego.
