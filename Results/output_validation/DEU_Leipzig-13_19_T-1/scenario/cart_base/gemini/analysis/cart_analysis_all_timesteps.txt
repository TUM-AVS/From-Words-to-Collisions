At t=4.2s, Ego is in lanelet 1126.

Obstacle 3249 is in lanelet 1125, adjacent to Ego's lanelet.  While its lateral distance is small and decreasing, and its longitudinal velocity is higher than Ego's, its trajectory and acceleration suggest it's unlikely to cause a collision in the immediate next timestep.  Therefore, risk level 2 or 3 (High/Medium).

Obstacle 3254 is in the same lanelet as Ego, and its longitudinal distance is decreasing, though the lateral distance is minimal. While its velocity is currently higher than Ego's, it's decelerating significantly. Risk level 2 or 3 (High/Medium).

Obstacle 3255 is also in Ego's lanelet, and further ahead.  Its velocity is higher than Ego's, but its longitudinal separation seems sufficient for the next timestep. Risk level 3 (Medium).

Other obstacles are in different lanelets and have sufficient separation, posing low risk.
