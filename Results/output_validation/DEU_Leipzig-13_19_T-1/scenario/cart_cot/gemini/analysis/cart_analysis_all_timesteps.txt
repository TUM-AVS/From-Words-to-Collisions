### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:

- Obstacle ID: 3243.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is in a different lanelet (198.0) than the ego vehicle (1126.0) and consistently located laterally far away.  The historical data confirms it remains distant.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: The obstacle has come to a stop based on the last few timesteps velocity and acceleration data, posing no immediate time-related risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 3244.0
- Distance Risk reason: This obstacle is not present in the most recent timestep. It was in a different lanelet (667.0) and moving quickly in earlier timesteps.  We assume it has cleared the area of interest.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason:  Not applicable in the most recent timestep due to absence. Historical data shows it was moving rapidly but not towards ego.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 3247.0
- Distance Risk reason: Located in a different lanelet (198.0) and positioned laterally away from the ego vehicle. Historical data reinforces this separation.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: While the obstacle has a considerable velocity, its trajectory in a different lanelet, as confirmed by historical data, mitigates the time-related risk.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- Obstacle ID: 3249.0
- Distance Risk reason:  Located in a different lanelet (1125.0) and positioned laterally beside the ego vehicle.  Requires careful monitoring. Historical data shows it is getting closer.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason:  The obstacle’s velocity is higher than the ego vehicle's, and decreasing, but its lateral position and different lanelet reduce the immediate risk.  Needs ongoing observation.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- Obstacle ID: 3253.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is in a different lanelet (668.0) and positioned laterally far away from the ego vehicle. History confirms it is stationary.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Stationary object, no time-related risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 3254.0
- Distance Risk reason: In the same lanelet (1126.0) as the ego vehicle and positioned longitudinally ahead.  Historical data indicates it is getting closer, increasing risk.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: The obstacle’s velocity, while decreasing over time, is similar to the ego vehicle’s, indicating a closing distance.  Continuous monitoring needed.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3

- Obstacle ID: 3255.0
- Distance Risk reason: In the same lanelet (1126.0) as the ego vehicle and positioned longitudinally ahead at a greater distance than obstacle 3254.0.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: The obstacle’s velocity is higher than the ego vehicle’s, requiring attention. However, the greater longitudinal distance mitigates some risk.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4


### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. **Most critical obstacles:** Obstacles 3254.0 and 3249.0 are the most critical. 3254.0 is in the same lane and ahead but getting closer. 3249.0 is in the adjacent lane and also closing but less risk due to lane separation.

2. **Trajectory analysis:** 3254.0 shows a consistent trajectory within the same lane as the ego vehicle. The trend over the timesteps indicates closing. 3249.0 has maintained its adjacent lane trajectory, presenting less of a longitudinal risk than 3254.0.

3. **Relative position, velocity, and acceleration:** 3254.0 is closer with a similar, albeit slowly decreasing, velocity. This means the ego vehicle is likely approaching it faster than the velocity difference might suggest due to 3254's deceleration.

4. **Collision determination:**  No collision has occurred, but the trend of decreasing distance and velocity difference with obstacle 3254.0 makes the situation potentially risky. While no imminent collision is observed over the presented timeframe, vigilance is paramount.

5. **Reasoning:**  The continuous decrease in distance between ego and 3254.0 along with the relative velocities over time raises significant concern and justifies a medium risk level. While other obstacles exist, the combination of lane occupancy, proximity, and evolving velocities makes 3254.0 the primary focus.
