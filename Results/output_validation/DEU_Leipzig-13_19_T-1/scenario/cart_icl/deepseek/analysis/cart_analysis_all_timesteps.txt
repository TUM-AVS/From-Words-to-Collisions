### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. No obstacles are in immediate collision path with the ego vehicle.
2. All obstacles are either in different lanelets or maintaining safe distances.
3. Velocities and trajectories indicate no imminent collision risk.
4. Historical data shows consistent safe movement patterns.
