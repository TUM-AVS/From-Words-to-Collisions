### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep (4.2s): Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 3243.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is in a different lanelet and far from the ego vehicle.  History shows it has stopped moving.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Obstacle is stationary. No time-based risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 3247.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is in a different lanelet and relatively far from the ego vehicle. History shows it is moving away laterally.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: While the obstacle is moving, its lateral movement and the ego vehicle's trajectory suggest decreasing risk over time.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- Obstacle ID: 3249.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is in a different lanelet, but relatively close to the ego vehicle.  History indicates some lateral separation.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason:  The obstacle's movement and the ego vehicle's trajectory suggest a potential for closer proximity, though not imminent collision.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3

- Obstacle ID: 3253.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is in a different lanelet and far from the ego vehicle. History confirms it is stationary.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Obstacle is stationary.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 3254.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is in the same lanelet and somewhat close, but history indicates some separation is maintained.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: The obstacle's velocity is similar to the ego vehicle's, but the history shows some relative speed differences.  Requires monitoring.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3

- Obstacle ID: 3255.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is in the same lanelet and further behind the ego vehicle. History shows increasing separation.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: While in the same lanelet, the obstacle's velocity is not significantly different, and the history indicates they are moving similarly.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4



### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
No obstacles are on a direct collision course with the ego vehicle in the most recent timestep. While some obstacles are in relatively close proximity and share the same lanelet, analysis of their past trajectories indicates that collision is not imminent.

### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
  "CollisionObstacles": [],
  "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null,
  "ScenarioAnalysis": {
    "IsCollisionScenario": false,
    "Reasoning": "No obstacles pose an immediate collision risk in the most recent timestep.  While some obstacles are relatively close, their trajectory history and current movement do not indicate an imminent collision."
  }
