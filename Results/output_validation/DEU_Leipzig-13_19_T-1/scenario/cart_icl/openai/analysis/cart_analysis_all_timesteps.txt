### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep:

#### Obstacle Analysis:

1. **Obstacle ID: 3243.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Far and stationary in a different lanelet. Minimal risk as there is no direct trajectory towards the ego vehicle.
   - **Distance safety score**: 5
   - **Time Risk reason**: No movement indicates a negligible collision risk.
   - **Time safety score**: 5
   - **Overall Risk score**: 5
   
2. **Obstacle ID: 3247.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Moving in a different trajectory and lanelet. Not oriented towards the ego vehicle.
   - **Distance safety score**: 5
   - **Time Risk reason**: Slowing down and moving away.
   - **Time safety score**: 5
   - **Overall Risk score**: 5
   
3. **Obstacle ID: 3249.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Parallel but moving at a safe distance, currently in separate lanelet.
   - **Distance safety score**: 4
   - **Time Risk reason**: Although deceleration is reducing, the vehicle is not on a collision course.
   - **Time safety score**: 4
   - **Overall Risk score**: 4
   
4. **Obstacle ID: 3253.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Stationary and far away in a separate lanelet, no collision path.
   - **Distance safety score**: 5
   - **Time Risk reason**: Persistent zero velocity contributes to negligible risk.
   - **Time safety score**: 5
   - **Overall Risk score**: 5
   
5. **Obstacle ID: 3254.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: In the same lanelet, approaching but currently maintaining a side trajectory.
   - **Distance safety score**: 3
   - **Time Risk reason**: Current deceleration trends indicate reduced risk of impact.
   - **Time safety score**: 3
   - **Overall Risk score**: 3
   
6. **Obstacle ID: 3255.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Moving parallel at a sufficient distance, following alongside but not converging.
   - **Distance safety score**: 4
   - **Time Risk reason**: Continued moderate acceleration away from the trajectory of the ego vehicle.
   - **Time safety score**: 4
   - **Overall Risk score**: 4

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. **Obstacle 3243.0** is stationary, and there is no impending collision path. Other obstacles (3247.0, 3253.0) are in different trajectories or stationary lanes that pose no risk.
2. **Obstacle 3249.0** and **3255.0** are maintaining parallel courses with safe spacing.
3. **Obstacle 3254.0** poses moderate risk due to approaching direction; however, deceleration trends reduce potential threat.
4. No immediate collision scenario detected; all obstacles either decelerate or have stable trajectories away from the ego vehicle.
