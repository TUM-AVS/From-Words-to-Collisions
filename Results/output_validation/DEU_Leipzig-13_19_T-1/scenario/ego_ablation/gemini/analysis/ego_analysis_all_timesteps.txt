Obstacle 3254 is at high risk. It is extremely close to the ego vehicle longitudinally (-0.17m) and approaching from behind with a relative longitudinal velocity of 4.57 m/s. While not an immediate collision, the proximity and speed difference create a very high probability of collision in the next few timesteps if no evasive action is taken.
