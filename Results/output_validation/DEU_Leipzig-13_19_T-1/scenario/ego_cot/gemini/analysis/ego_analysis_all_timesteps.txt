### Safety analysis for timestep 3.3s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 3243
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is at the same longitudinal and lateral position as the ego vehicle.
- Distance safety score: 0
- Time Risk reason: Although moving away laterally, the longitudinal velocity suggests a potential collision.
- Time safety score: 1
- Overall Risk score: 0

- Obstacle ID: 3244
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is longitudinally and laterally far from the ego vehicle.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Moving away longitudinally but approaching laterally; however, the lateral distance and relative velocity don't pose an immediate threat within the analyzed timeframe.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- Obstacle ID: 3247
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is longitudinally and laterally far from the ego vehicle.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Moving closer longitudinally, but the current distance and relative velocity suggest sufficient time to react. Moving away laterally reduces risk.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3

- Obstacle ID: 3249
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is at the same longitudinal and lateral position as the ego vehicle.
- Distance safety score: 0
- Time Risk reason: Although moving away laterally, the longitudinal velocity difference is significant, implying potential collision risk.
- Time safety score: 1
- Overall Risk score: 0


- Obstacle ID: 3253
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is behind and to the right of the ego vehicle, and moving away longitudinally.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason:  No lateral relative motion and moving away longitudinally minimizes collision risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 4

- Obstacle ID: 3254
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is close behind the ego vehicle.
- Distance safety score: 1
- Time Risk reason:  Rapidly approaching from behind.
- Time safety score: 1
- Overall Risk score: 1

- Obstacle ID: 3255
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is far behind the ego vehicle.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Approaching from behind but the distance provides some buffer.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3



### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
    "CollisionObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": ["3243", "3249"],
        "OverallRiskScore": "0"
    },
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "3254",
        "OverallRiskScore": "1"
    },
    "IsCollisionScenario": true,
    "Justification": "Obstacles 3243 and 3249 have an overall risk score of 0, indicating a collision. Obstacle 3254 poses an extreme risk (score 1) due to its close proximity and high closing velocity from behind."
}
```
```
The subsequent timesteps (3.4s to 4.2s) follow a similar analysis pattern. Obstacle 3254 consistently poses a high risk due to its closing velocity from behind the ego vehicle. Obstacles 3243 and 3249 initially present collision risks but later transition to lower risk levels as they move away. The JSON summary would be updated accordingly for each timestep, reflecting the current highest risk levels and justifications.  It is crucial to continue monitoring Obstacle 3254 and enact appropriate avoidance maneuvers due to its persistent high risk. Itâ€™s important to process the data at each timestamp and update the risk assessment.
