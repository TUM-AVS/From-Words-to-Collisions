Let me analyze the most recent timestep (4.2 seconds) for collision risks:

Obstacle 3243 (Right):
- Lateral distance: -22.39m (moving away)
- Longitudinal alignment: 0.00m (exact alignment)
- Relative velocity: lateral -0.00 m/s (stationary), longitudinal -2.13 m/s (moving away)
- MDC: 22.39m (lateral)
- Risk: 5 (No Risk) - Moving away in both dimensions

Obstacle 3247 (Front-right):
- Longitudinal: 8.70m (decreasing from 9.13m at 4.1s)
- Lateral: -11.49m (moving away)
- Relative velocity: longitudinal -4.70 m/s (approaching), lateral -4.91 m/s (moving away)
- TTC (longitudinal): 8.70/4.70 = 1.85s
- MDC: 8.70m (longitudinal)
- Risk: 3 (Medium Risk) - Approaching longitudinally but lateral distance increasing

Obstacle 3249 (Front-left):
- Longitudinal: 2.81m (increasing from 2.26m at 4.1s)
- Lateral: 2.06m (increasing)
- Relative velocity: longitudinal 5.52 m/s (moving away), lateral 0.24 m/s (moving away)
- Risk: 5 (No Risk) - Moving away in both dimensions

Obstacle 3253 (Rear-right):
- Longitudinal: -9.34m (moving away)
- Lateral: -22.93m (stationary)
- Relative velocity: longitudinal -2.13 m/s (moving away), lateral -0.00 m/s
- Risk: 5 (No Risk) - Moving away in both dimensions

Obstacle 3254 (Behind):
- Longitudinal: -0.17m (very close behind)
- Lateral: 0.00m (exact alignment)
- Relative velocity: longitudinal 4.57 m/s (approaching)
- TTC: 0.17/4.57 = 0.037s (extremely low)
- MDC: 0.17m
- Risk: 1 (Extreme Risk) - Nearly touching from behind with high approach speed

Obstacle 3255 (Behind):
- Longitudinal: -16.32m
- Lateral: 0.00m
- Relative velocity: longitudinal 5.45 m/s (approaching)
- TTC: 16.32/5.45 = 2.99s
- MDC: 16.32m
- Risk: 3 (Medium Risk) - Approaching from far behind

Trajectory Analysis:
- Obstacle 3254 shows consistent approach from behind with decreasing distance (from -1.13m at 4.0s to -0.17m at 4.2s)
- At current relative velocity, will make contact in next timestep
- All other obstacles are either moving away or at safe distances
