### Analysis of Most Recent Timesteps:

**1. Obstacle 3243:**
- **Location/Description:** On the right, with exact longitudinal alignment.
- **Adjusted Distances:** Longitudinal = 0.00m, Lateral = -22.39m.
- **Velocity/Acceleration:** Lateral velocity 0.00 m/s, moving away right.
- **Trajectory:** Stable lateral position with no change in trajectory toward the ego vehicle. No longitudinal movement.
- **Risk Assessment:**
  - **MDC:** Not applicable since it's moving away and no relative lateral distance change.
  - **TTC:** Not applicable (no relative movement toward ego vehicle).
  - **Overall Risk Score:** 5 (No Risk).

**2. Obstacle 3247:**
- **Location/Description:** Front-right, driving toward ego longitudinally, moving away laterally.
- **Adjusted Distances:** Longitudinal = 8.70m, Lateral = -11.49m.
- **Velocity/Acceleration:** Longitudinal velocity -4.70 m/s, lateral velocity -4.91 m/s.
- **Trajectory:** Approaching ego vehicle longitudinally.
- **Risk Assessment:**
  - **MDC:** Calculated based on closing longitudinal distance.
  - **TTC-longitudinal:** 8.70 / 4.70 = 1.85s.
  - **MDC for lateral:** Lateral path not closing in short term.
  - **Overall Risk Score:** 3 (Medium Risk).

- **Trajectory:** Moving away in both dimensions.
- **Risk Assessment:**
  - **MDC and TTC not applicable:** Both distances are increasing.
  - **Overall Risk Score:** 5 (No Risk).

**4. Obstacle 3253:**
- **Location/Description:** Rear-right, moving away.
- **Adjusted Distances:** Longitudinal = -9.34m, Lateral = -22.93m.
- **Velocity/Acceleration:** Lateral velocity remains constant, not moving toward ego.
- **Trajectory:** Stable position.
- **Risk Assessment:**
  - **MDC and TTC not applicable:** Moving away.
  - **Overall Risk Score:** 5 (No Risk).

**5. Obstacle 3254:**
