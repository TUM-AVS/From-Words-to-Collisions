### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 3243
- Relative Direction: Right
- Distance Risk Reason: Laterally far away and longitudinally aligned. No risk of collision laterally as it's moving away.  No longitudinal risk as it maintains alignment.
- Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 0
- Lateral Distance Safety Score: 5
- Overall Distance Safety Score: 5.0
- Time Risk Reason: Infinite lateral TTC, confirming no lateral risk. Zero longitudinal TTC, but given the consistent lateral movement away, no immediate collision risk.
- Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 0
- Lateral Time Safety Score: 5
- Overall Time Safety Score: 5.0
- Overall Risk Score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 3247
- Relative Direction: Front-right
- Distance Risk Reason:  Longitudinally getting closer, posing an increasing risk.  Lateral distance is safe and increasing, reducing risk.
- Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 4
- Lateral Distance Safety Score: 5
- Overall Distance Safety Score: 4.5
- Time Risk Reason: Decreasing longitudinal TTC suggests increasing longitudinal risk, below 2 seconds now, needs attention. Infinite lateral TTC indicates no lateral risk.
- Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 3
- Lateral Time Safety Score: 5
- Overall Time Safety Score: 4
- Overall Risk Score: 4

- Obstacle ID: 3249
- Relative Direction: Front-left
- Distance Risk Reason: Longitudinally close, but trajectory suggests moving away from ego. Laterally safe distance.
- Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 5
- Lateral Distance Safety Score: 5
- Overall Distance Safety Score: 5.0
- Time Risk Reason: Infinite TTC in both directions indicates no collision risk currently.
- Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 5
- Lateral Time Safety Score: 5
- Overall Time Safety Score: 5
- Overall Risk Score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 3253
- Relative Direction: Rear-right
- Distance Risk Reason: Longitudinally and laterally far away and moving away from the ego vehicle, posing no risk.
- Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 5
- Lateral Distance Safety Score: 5
- Overall Distance Safety Score: 5.0
- Time Risk Reason: Infinite TTC in both directions reinforces the absence of risk from this obstacle.
- Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 5
- Lateral Time Safety Score: 5
- Overall Time Safety Score: 5
- Overall Risk Score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 3254
- Relative Direction: Behind
- Distance Risk Reason:  Longitudinally very close and rapidly approaching, posing extreme risk. No lateral distance.
- Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 1
- Lateral Distance Safety Score: 0
- Overall Distance Safety Score: 1.0
- Time Risk Reason: Very low longitudinal TTC, extremely high risk of rear-end collision imminently. Zero lateral TTC due to alignment but not contributing to increased risk given the longitudinal situation.
- Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 1
- Lateral Time Safety Score: 0
- Overall Time Safety Score: 1.0
- Overall Risk Score: 1

- Obstacle ID: 3255
- Relative Direction: Behind
- Distance Risk Reason: Longitudinally far, but closing in, although at a less concerning rate than 3254.
- Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 5
- Lateral Distance Safety Score: 0
- Overall Distance Safety Score: 5.0
- Time Risk Reason: TTC suggests a safe distance longitudinally currently, but continued monitoring is necessary.
- Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 4
- Lateral Time Safety Score: 0
- Overall Time Safety Score: 4.0
- Overall Risk Score: 5
