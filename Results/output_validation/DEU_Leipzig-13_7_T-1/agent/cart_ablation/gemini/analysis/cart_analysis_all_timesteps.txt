Here's the collision risk assessment:

**Analysis:**

* **Obstacle 3243:** This obstacle is moving at a substantial speed and shows some erratic acceleration behavior. It's located in a different lanelet initially but transitions to lanelet 198. Given its trajectory and proximity to the ego vehicle, there might be a medium risk (3), although further projection is needed to confirm.

* **Obstacle 3247:** Initially in lanelet 198, its velocity decreases significantly over the observed timesteps, nearly coming to a stop. It doesn't pose an immediate collision risk, and the risk level is medium (3).

* **Obstacle 3252:** Stationary and located in lanelet 668. It presents no risk (5).

* **Obstacle 3254:** This obstacle shares the same lanelet (1126) as the ego vehicle and is moving at a high speed. It's relatively close and its future trajectory needs careful monitoring. This is a High risk (2) obstacle, potentially becoming extreme (1) very soon.

* **Obstacle 3256:** Located in lanelet 2734 and moving at a considerable speed. Based on the provided data, it seems to be moving away from the ego vehicle and represents a low risk (4).

* **Obstacle 3260:** Initially in lanelet 2875 but later appears in lanelet 1126 (same as the ego vehicle).  Its high speed and presence in the same lane necessitate close observation. This is a high risk (2) obstacle, with potential to become extreme (1) soon.

* **Obstacle 3261:** Shares lanelet 1125 adjacent to and moving faster than the ego vehicle. Its behavior needs further prediction to determine precise risk, initially assessed as low (4), changing to medium (3) as the future trajectory is not confirmed.
