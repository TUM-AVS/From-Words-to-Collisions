Obstacle 3243: This obstacle is in a different lane and although its trajectory might bring it closer to the ego vehicle, it doesn't pose an immediate collision risk over the observed time steps. Risk score: 4 (Low Risk)

Obstacle 3245: This obstacle appears in later timesteps and is relatively far from the ego vehicle.  Risk score: 5 (Negligible Risk)

Obstacle 3247:  Similar to 3243, it's in a different lane and doesn't present an immediate collision risk. Risk score: 4 (Low Risk)

Obstacle 3252: Stationary and located to the side of the ego vehicle, not posing a risk based on current information. Risk score: 5 (Negligible Risk)

Obstacle 3254: This obstacle is in the same lane as the ego vehicle and moving considerably faster. Its x-position gets closer over the time steps, suggesting a potential collision risk.  Although the positions appear close, given the short prediction horizon, it's difficult to definitively say if it's an extreme risk. We need more future timesteps to determine the appropriate risk score.  To be conservative, we classify it as High Risk. Risk score: 2 (High Risk).

Obstacle 3256:  This obstacle is in a neighboring lane and its position suggests it's getting closer to the ego vehicle but not significantly.  Risk score: 3 (Medium Risk).

Obstacle 3260: This obstacle is in a different lane and although its trajectory could approach the ego vehicle, the data does not suggest immediate risk. Risk score: 3 (Medium Risk)

Obstacle 3261: In a neighboring lane and moving faster than the ego vehicle, but the provided data does not suggest an immediate collision risk. Risk score: 3 (Medium Risk)
