Obstacle 3254 shows concerning behavior. It is in the same lane as the ego vehicle and approaching rapidly from behind with significantly higher velocity (10.93 vs 4.47 m/s).  While not an immediate collision, the rapid approach and velocity difference require close monitoring and potential evasive action by the ego vehicle. A small deceleration by 3254 or ego's acceleration would mitigate risk.

Obstacle 3261 is also in a concerning position.  It has a much higher velocity (13.77 m/s) than the ego vehicle (4.47 m/s) and is approaching rapidly from behind. Although not as close as 3254 initially, its speed poses a high risk in the near future.  The lane change of the obstacle between timestamps introduces uncertainty and increases the risk.

Obstacle 3243 is moving with a higher velocity (7.20 m/s) and in close proximity to the ego vehicle. However, considering its current trajectory and the opposing heading angle, the risk of collision is not imminent and can be considered medium.
