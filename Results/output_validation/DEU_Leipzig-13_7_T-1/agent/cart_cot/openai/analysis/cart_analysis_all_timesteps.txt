### Analysis

1. **Obstacle 3260:**
   - **Position:** The obstacle is ahead of the ego vehicle in the same lane.
   - **Velocity:** 9.4677, significantly higher than the ego's 1.9087.
   - **Acceleration:** -2.3056, indicating it is decelerating.
   - **Risk:** The obstacle is moving away at a higher speed, reducing the risk of collision. Thus, it does not pose an immediate threat to the ego vehicle.

2. **Obstacle 3254:**
   - **Position:** Located behind the ego, moving in the same lane.
   - **Velocity:** 9.3837, higher than the ego's 1.9087.
   - **Acceleration:** -0.3745, decelerating slightly.
   - **Risk:** Given its higher speed and deceleration, the risk remains low due to its position behind the ego vehicle.

3. **Obstacle 3261:**
   - **Position:** Located on a parallel lane, slightly behind and to the side of the ego.
   - **Velocity:** 12.7599, much higher than the ego's velocity.
   - **Acceleration:** -4.1746, significant deceleration.
   - **Explanation for High Risk (Score = 2):** Given the high speed and proximity on a parallel lane, there might be a risk in the case of any unintended lane change or maneuvers made by either vehicle. However, significant deceleration reduces the immediate threat.

4. **Obstacle 3243 and 3247:**
   - **Position:** Located on a different lane and moving at a different orientation.
   - **Velocity & Acceleration:** Exhibit different trajectories, not aligning or coinciding with the ego vehicle's path.
   - **Risk:** Due to differing paths and orientations, they pose negligible immediate risk.

5. **Ego and Obstacle 3256:**
   - **Position:** While in a different lane, 3256 shows a pattern of increase in speed.
   - **Velocity:** 10.8652, significantly higher than the ego's speed.
   - **Acceleration:** 2.3476, indicating increasing velocity towards the ego.
   - **Explanation for Extreme Risk (Score = 1):** The combination of high speed and acceleration suggests the potential for a swift motion across lanes towards the ego vehicle. Particularly risky if there's a lane change or system delay.
