Obstacle 3254 is in the same lane as the ego vehicle and is closing in relatively fast. At the last timestep (3.8 seconds), the distance between the ego and obstacle 3254 is approximately 5.5 meters, and the relative velocity is roughly -7.5 m/s (obstacle is moving faster in the same direction), which translates to a TTC of roughly 0.73 seconds. This represents a very high risk of collision. However,  there is lateral space. Assuming lane width around 3.5m there appears to be some lateral space available for the ego vehicle for collision avoidance by emergency braking or lane change if feasible. Thus,  it does not seem to be an unavoidable collision at this point.

Obstacle 3261 is also relatively close to the ego vehicle, and moving significantly faster than the ego vehicle. The relative speed and closing distance suggests an eventual overtaking maneuver by this obstacle.
