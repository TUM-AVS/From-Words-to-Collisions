At timestamp 3.8 seconds, the following obstacles present varying degrees of risk:

* **Obstacle 3243:** This obstacle is in the front-right, 16.14m longitudinal and -9.51m lateral distance away, moving away laterally.  It poses no immediate threat. Risk score: 5.

* **Obstacle 3245:** Located front-right (6.37m longitudinal, -25.59m lateral), this obstacle is relatively close longitudinally but far laterally. Although it's driving toward the ego car laterally, the lateral distance is significant enough to not pose an immediate threat.  Risk score: 4.

* **Obstacle 3247:**  This obstacle is at 4.69m longitudinal and -22.14m lateral distance in the front-right. The MDC represents a low risk, and no lateral movement means a collision is unlikely. Risk score: 4.


* **Obstacle 3252:** At -1.84m longitudinal and -23.40m lateral distance in the rear-right, this obstacle is moving away. It poses no risk. Risk score: 5

* **Obstacle 3254:** This obstacle is very close behind the ego vehicle at -1.17m longitudinal distance. The small MDC indicates a high risk of collision. Risk score: 2.

* **Obstacle 3256:** Located front-left (20.96m longitudinal and 3.84m lateral), it is moving away and presents negligible risk. Risk score: 5.

* **Obstacle 3260:** This obstacle is behind the ego vehicle (-18.28m longitudinally) and approaching. There's ample distance and time to react, so the risk is low. Risk score: 4.

* **Obstacle 3261:** At -1.25m longitudinal and 1.98m lateral distance, this obstacle is very close and approaching from the rear-left. While the lateral distance offers some margin, the longitudinal proximity indicates a high risk. Risk score: 2.
