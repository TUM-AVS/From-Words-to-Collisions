At timestamp 3.8 seconds, the following obstacles are present:

* **Obstacle 3243:** Located front-right, with a longitudinal distance of 16.14m and moving towards the ego vehicle at -3.72 m/s.  Lateral distance is -9.51m and moving away at -5.76 m/s. This obstacle poses a low risk (4) due to sufficient distance and the lateral movement away from the ego vehicle.

* **Obstacle 3245:** Located front-right, with a longitudinal distance of 6.37m and approaching at -0.55 m/s. Lateral distance is -25.59m and moving towards the ego vehicle laterally at 1.36 m/s. Despite the close longitudinal distance, the high lateral distance and slow approach speed suggest a medium risk (3).

* **Obstacle 3247:** Located front-right, 4.69m longitudinally and approaching at -1.91 m/s. Lateral distance is -22.14m with no lateral relative motion. The close longitudinal distance and approach speed warrant a medium risk assessment (3).

* **Obstacle 3252:**  Located rear-right, -1.84m longitudinally and moving away at -1.91 m/s. Lateral distance is -23.40m with no lateral relative motion.  This obstacle is moving away and poses a negligible risk (5).

* **Obstacle 3254:** Located behind the ego vehicle at -1.17m longitudinally and approaching at 7.47 m/s. Lateral distance is 0.00m. The very close proximity and high approach speed indicate an extreme risk (1) of collision.

* **Obstacle 3256:** Located front-left, 20.96m longitudinally and moving away at 8.86 m/s. Lateral distance is 3.84m and moving away at 1.42 m/s. This obstacle is moving away and poses a negligible risk (5).

* **Obstacle 3260:** Located behind the ego vehicle at -18.28m and approaching at 7.52 m/s. Lateral distance is 0.00m. Although approaching at a high speed, the distance warrants a low risk (4) for now, but requires monitoring.

* **Obstacle 3261:** Located rear-left, -1.25m longitudinally and approaching rapidly at 10.84 m/s. Lateral distance is 1.98m. This close proximity and very high approach speed from behind signifies an extreme risk (1) of collision.


Risk Levels:
0: Collision - Physical contact occurred or unavoidable
1: Extreme Risk - Immediate collision likely
2: High Risk - Close to collision, needs quick action
3: Medium Risk - Manageable with proper reaction
4: Low Risk - Minimal risk, sufficient time to react
5: Negligible Risk - No significant risk
