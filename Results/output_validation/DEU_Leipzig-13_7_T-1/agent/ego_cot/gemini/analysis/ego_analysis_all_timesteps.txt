### Safety analysis for timestep 3.8 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

**Assumptions and Clarifications:**

* Since *real* longitudinal and lateral distances are provided, and no vehicle sizes are given, I will use the provided real distances directly.  I will refer to these as simply `d_long` and `d_lat`. The prompt emphasizes using *adjusted* distances but doesn't provide them, so this is the best I can do.
* I will calculate TTC (Time-to-Collision) using the following simplified method: `TTC = distance / relative_velocity`. This assumes constant velocity, which is a simplification but suitable for short-term risk assessment.  I'll calculate longitudinal and lateral TTC (TTClong and TTClat). Note there isn't a true combined TTC; these must be considered somewhat separately as an object could have a long TTC in one direction but a short TTC in the other direction. I will consider the shortest TTC when assigning scores
* MDC (Minimum Distance to Collision) is assumed to be the minimum of the provided `d_long` and `d_lat` values since we have no other information. If an obstacle's distance is increasing, we consider the distance to the ego car increasing (MDC is the current distance), otherwise MDC is 0 as it may drive to the ego car. We can only work with the provided data.
* A combined overall risk score is provided based on the lower of the distance and time-based scores. For example, if an obstacle gets 3 for distance and 1 for time, its overall risk is 1.
