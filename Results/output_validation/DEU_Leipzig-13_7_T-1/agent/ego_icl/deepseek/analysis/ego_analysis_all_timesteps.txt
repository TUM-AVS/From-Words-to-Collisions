Let me analyze each obstacle at the most recent timestep (3.8 seconds) and assess collision risks:

1. Obstacle 3243 (Front-right):
   - Adjusted distances: longitudinal 16.14m, lateral -9.51m
   - Relative velocity: longitudinal -3.72m/s (approaching), lateral -5.76m/s (moving away)
   - MDC: Lateral distance increasing (9.51m), longitudinal closing but still large distance → MDC >5m
   - TTC: longitudinal 16.14/3.72 = 4.34s (Low Risk)
   - Overall Risk: 4 (Low Risk)

2. Obstacle 3245 (Front-right):
   - Adjusted distances: longitudinal 6.37m, lateral -25.59m
   - Relative velocity: longitudinal -0.55m/s (approaching), lateral 1.36m/s (approaching)
   - MDC: Very large lateral distance (25.59m) dominates → MDC >5m
   - TTC: longitudinal 6.37/0.55 = 11.58s (No Risk)
   - Overall Risk: 5 (No Risk)

3. Obstacle 3247 (Front-right):
   - Adjusted distances: longitudinal 4.69m, lateral -22.14m
   - Relative velocity: longitudinal -1.91m/s (approaching), lateral 0.00m/s
   - MDC: Large lateral distance (22.14m) → MDC >5m
   - TTC: longitudinal 4.69/1.91 = 2.46s (Medium Risk)
   - Overall Risk: 3 (Medium Risk)

4. Obstacle 3252 (Rear-right):
   - Adjusted distances: longitudinal -1.84m, lateral -23.40m
   - Relative velocity: longitudinal -1.91m/s (moving away), lateral 0.00m/s
   - MDC: Large lateral distance (23.40m) → MDC >5m
   - TTC: Not applicable (moving away)
   - Overall Risk: 5 (No Risk)

5. Obstacle 3254 (Behind):
   - Adjusted distances: longitudinal -1.17m, lateral 0.00m
   - Relative velocity: longitudinal 7.47m/s (approaching), lateral -0.29m/s
   - MDC: Lateral aligned (0.00m), longitudinal distance 1.17m closing fast → MDC 1.17m (High Risk)
   - TTC: 1.17/7.47 = 0.16s (Extreme Risk)
   - Overall Risk: 1 (Extreme Risk)

6. Obstacle 3256 (Front-left):
   - Adjusted distances: longitudinal 20.96m, lateral 3.84m
   - Relative velocity: longitudinal 8.86m/s (moving away), lateral 1.42m/s (moving away)
   - MDC: Both distances increasing → MDC >5m
   - TTC: Not applicable (moving away)
   - Overall Risk: 5 (No Risk)

7. Obstacle 3260 (Behind):
   - Adjusted distances: longitudinal -18.28m, lateral 0.00m
   - Relative velocity: longitudinal 7.52m/s (approaching), lateral -0.81m/s
   - MDC: Large longitudinal distance (18.28m) → MDC >5m
   - TTC: 18.28/7.52 = 2.43s (Medium Risk)
   - Overall Risk: 3 (Medium Risk)

8. Obstacle 3261 (Rear-left):
   - Adjusted distances: longitudinal -1.25m, lateral 1.98m
   - Relative velocity: longitudinal 10.84m/s (approaching), lateral -0.43m/s (approaching)
   - MDC: Longitudinal distance 1.25m closing very fast, lateral 1.98m → MDC 1.25m (High Risk)
   - TTC: longitudinal 1.25/10.84 = 0.12s (Extreme Risk)
   - Overall Risk: 1 (Extreme Risk)

Most critical observations:
- Obstacle 3254 is approaching from behind at extreme risk (TTC 0.16s)
- Obstacle 3261 is approaching from rear-left at extreme risk (TTC 0.12s)
- Both have very small distances and high closing velocities
