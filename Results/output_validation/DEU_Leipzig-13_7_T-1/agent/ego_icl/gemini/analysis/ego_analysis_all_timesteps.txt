Obstacle 3243: Front-right, moving away laterally, approaching longitudinally.  Longitudinal distance decreasing across timesteps, lateral distance increasing. Low risk.

Obstacle 3245: Front-right, recent appearance. Laterally approaching, longitudinally approaching. Medium risk due to longitudinal proximity.

Obstacle 3247: Front-right, moving away laterally, approaching longitudinally. Longitudinal distance decreasing across timesteps, lateral distance slightly increasing. Medium risk due to longitudinal proximity.

Obstacle 3252: Rear-right, moving away longitudinally. No lateral relative motion.  Longitudinal distance increasing, lateral distance stable. Low risk.

Obstacle 3254: Behind, approaching longitudinally. Exact lateral alignment. Longitudinal distance rapidly decreasing across timesteps. High risk due to longitudinal proximity and closing velocity.

Obstacle 3256: Front-left, moving away both longitudinally and laterally.  Distances increasing across timesteps. Negligible risk.

Obstacle 3261: Rear-left, approaching both longitudinally and laterally. Longitudinal distance rapidly decreasing, lateral distance stable. High risk due to longitudinal proximity and closing velocity.
