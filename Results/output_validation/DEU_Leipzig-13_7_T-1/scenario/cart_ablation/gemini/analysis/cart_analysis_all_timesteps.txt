Here's the collision risk analysis for the provided scenario:

**Timestep Focus:** 4.0 seconds

**Ego Vehicle (3250.0):** Located in lanelet 1126.0, velocity 1.52 m/s, decelerating at -1.08 m/s².

**Obstacle Analysis:**

* **Obstacle 3254.0:** Located in the same lanelet (1126.0) as Ego, position (-437.11, -33.96). Velocity 9.18 m/s, decelerating at -1.79 m/s².  While decelerating, this obstacle's high closing velocity relative to Ego and its proximity represents an extreme risk.

* **Obstacle 3261.0:** Located in lanelet 1125.0, position (-437.55, -30.46). Velocity 11.92 m/s, decelerating at -4.17 m/s². Though in an adjacent lanelet, its high velocity, proximity to Ego, and location relative to Ego's orientation (slightly ahead and to the side), suggests it might cut into Ego's lane, making it a high risk.  We classify it as Extreme risk due to limited reaction time and the potential for lane change behavior.

* **Obstacle 3256.0:** Located in lanelet 2734.0, position (-408.29, -20.06). Velocity 11.22 m/s, accelerating at 1.58 m/s².  Despite the different lanelet, the high velocity and acceleration combined with its trajectory and the relatively close proximity raise concerns.  We label this a high risk as it could cut in front of the ego vehicle without warning. Since it isn't currently on a direct collision path, and the location isn't imminent, it gets a 2 instead of a 1.

Other obstacles are not considered high risk due to greater distance, different lanelets, or low relative velocities.
