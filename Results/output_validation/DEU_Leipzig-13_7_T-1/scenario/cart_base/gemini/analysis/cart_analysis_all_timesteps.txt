Obstacle 3254 is in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle and is relatively close.  The vehicles are approaching each other with a high closing velocity (Ego velocity decreasing but still positive, Obstacle 3254 velocity much higher). Although Obstacle 3254 shows some deceleration, the closing rate and proximity suggest a high risk of collision within the next few timesteps if current trajectories continue.

Obstacle 3261, while in a neighboring lanelet (1125 vs Ego's 1126), is very close to the ego vehicle and traveling at a significantly higher velocity.  This presents an extreme risk, especially considering the lateral proximity and high closing velocity. Even a slight deviation in either vehicle's trajectory could result in a collision.

  "ScenarioAnalysis": {
    "IsCollisionScenario": false,
    "Reasoning": "Obstacle 3254 poses an extreme risk due to its close proximity, high closing velocity in the same lanelet, and despite decelerating there is high risk of collision. Obstacle 3261 also poses extreme risk due to very close lateral proximity and high closing velocity.  No collision has occurred yet."
