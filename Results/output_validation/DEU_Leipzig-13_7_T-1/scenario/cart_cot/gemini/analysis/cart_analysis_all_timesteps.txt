### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

- Obstacle ID: 3243.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is located in a different lanelet and its y-coordinate is diverging from the ego vehicle's.  Historical data shows it moving further away laterally.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: While the obstacle's velocity is higher than the ego vehicle's, the trajectories are diverging. The historical data confirms this trend.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 3245.0
- Distance Risk reason: This obstacle appears at t=3.5s and is located in a different lanelet with a significant lateral offset.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Based on its initial trajectory, it does not pose an immediate threat.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 3247.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is located in a different lanelet with a substantial lateral distance from the ego vehicle.  Its velocity has decreased to near zero and historical data shows it consistently moving away.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: The obstacle's velocity is near zero and decreasing, posing no immediate time-related risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 3252.0
- Distance Risk reason: Located in a different lanelet with a significant lateral offset. It's stationary. Historical data shows no change in position.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Obstacle is stationary, posing no time-dependent risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 3254.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle, but positioned behind it. The longitudinal distance is increasing based on the velocity differences.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: The obstacle is traveling faster than the ego vehicle, but since it's behind, there is still time to react.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- Obstacle ID: 3256.0
- Distance Risk reason: Located in a different lanelet.  The y-coordinate shows lateral divergence, increasing over time.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Although the obstacle has high velocity, the diverging trajectories minimize the time-related risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 3260.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is in the same lanelet but significantly behind the ego vehicle.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Although it has high velocity, its position relative to the ego vehicle and the trend over time lessen the risk.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- Obstacle ID: 3261.0
- Distance Risk reason: Positioned behind the ego vehicle, with a safe longitudinal distance. Its Y-coordinate indicates it is likely in an adjacent lane.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Despite its high velocity and deceleration, its position behind the ego vehicle mitigates the risk.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4


### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. **Most critical obstacles:**  3254.0, 3260.0, and 3261.0 are in the same or adjacent lanelets and warrant closer inspection.
2. **Trajectory analysis:** Over the 10 timesteps, 3254.0, 3260.0, and 3261.0 remain behind the ego vehicle, with the distance increasing.  While they are traveling at higher speeds than the ego vehicle, the trend suggests they are not on a collision course.
3. **Relative positions, velocities, and accelerations:** The ego vehicle and obstacle 3254.0 are in the same lane, but the obstacle is behind. 3260 and 3261 start slightly offset laterally and remain so over the analyzed timesteps. The higher velocities of the obstacles do not translate to imminent danger given their positions.
4. **Collision determination:** No collision has occurred or is imminent based on the provided data.
5. **Reasoning:** While some obstacles have higher velocities, their trajectories, combined with their relative positions, do not present a collision risk within the evaluated timeframe.
