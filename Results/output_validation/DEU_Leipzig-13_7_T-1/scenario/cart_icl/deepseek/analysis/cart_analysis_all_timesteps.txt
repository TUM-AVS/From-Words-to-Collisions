### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. **Ego Vehicle**: Moving slowly (1.5223 velocity) and decelerating in lanelet 1126.0.  
2. **Obstacle 3254.0**: In same lanelet (1126.0) with high velocity (9.185) but decelerating. Distance is closing but not imminent.  
3. **Other Obstacles**: Either in different lanelets or moving away.  
4. **Conclusion**: No immediate collision risk. Highest risk is from Obstacle 3254.0 (score 2).
