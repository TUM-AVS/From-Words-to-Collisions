- Time Risk reason:  Different trajectories, no risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 3245.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is far from ego and in a different lanelet.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Different trajectories, no risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 3247.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is far from ego and in a different lanelet, stationary.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Stationary and poses no risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 3252.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is laterally far from ego and in a different lanelet, stationary.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Stationary and poses no risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 3254.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is in the same lanelet and approaching ego vehicle from behind. The distance is closing, requiring observation.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Although approaching, there's ample time and space for ego to react.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- Obstacle ID: 3256.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is in a different lanelet and reasonably far from ego.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Different trajectories, no risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 3260.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is in same lanelet but far behind ego.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: No time risk as it's significantly behind.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 3261.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is in an adjacent lanelet, moderate lateral distance, moving faster than ego.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Potential for lane change conflicts, but not immediate.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4


### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
No immediate collisions. Obstacle 3254 is approaching from behind in the same lane, but the risk is currently low given the distance and relative speed. Obstacle 3261 is in the adjacent lane, moving faster, posing a low risk currently, but its trajectory should be monitored. No obstacles present an immediate collision threat.

### Summary in JSON Format: 
```json
{
  "CollisionObstacles": [],
  "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null,
  "ScenarioAnalysis": {
    "IsCollisionScenario": false,
    "Reasoning": "No obstacle poses an immediate collision risk in the next timestep.  Obstacle 3254 is approaching from behind and obstacle 3261 is moving faster in an adjacent lane, but both have low current risk levels."
  }
