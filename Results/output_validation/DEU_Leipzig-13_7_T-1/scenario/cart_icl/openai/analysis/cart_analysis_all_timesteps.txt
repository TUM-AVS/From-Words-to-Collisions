### Obstacle Analysis:

#### Obstacle ID: 3243.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle has kept a relatively stable trajectory, staying outside the immediate path of the Ego vehicle, though slightly to the left and mildly converging to the lane's center.
- **Distance safety score**: 4
- **Time Risk reason**: The obstacle's speed and acceleration have been decreasing, moving towards a stable velocity, which suggests decreasing interaction risk.
- **Time safety score**: 4
- **Overall Risk score**: 4

#### Obstacle ID: 3245.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: Positioned behind and to the left of the Ego and maintaining the distance. Not on a likely collision course.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: Velocity changes are negligible, maintaining a slow and consistent pace.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 3247.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: Stationary and significantly to the side of the Ego's path, reducing immediate collision risk.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: Speed remains at zero without variance, confirming no imminent movement.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 3252.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: Stationary with significant lateral offset; no crossing of paths with Ego.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: No change in velocity or acceleration over time.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 3254.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: Moving in the same lanelet as Ego and closing in proximity; however, keeping a forward progression without erratic changes.
- **Distance safety score**: 3
- **Time Risk reason**: Consistent deceleration reducing potential for collision.
- **Time safety score**: 3
- **Overall Risk score**: 3

#### Obstacle ID: 3256.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: Positioned on another lanelet with a divergent path, consistently moving away from the Ego.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: Shows consistent acceleration away from the Ego, reinforcing safe distances.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 3260.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: Converging into the lane near Ego's position with reducing speed yet offsetting laterally.
- **Distance safety score**: 3
- **Time Risk reason**: Moderate deceleration presenting minimal interaction threat but observable path convergence needs consideration.
- **Time safety score**: 3
- **Overall Risk score**: 3

#### Obstacle ID: 3261.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: Approaching the same lanelet as Ego from the back; maintains a lateral separation.
- **Distance safety score**: 4
- **Time Risk reason**: Although velocity decreases, it still indicates likelihood for rapid progression if necessary.
- **Time safety score**: 4
- **Overall Risk score**: 4

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
Given the observations and scores, none of the obstacles are currently on a direct collision course or at high risk level with the Ego vehicle. Obstacle movements indicate stable, separation-maintaining paths without unexpected changes that could endanger the Ego vehicle. All obstacles are assessed to be manageable within the normal operational constraints of an autonomous vehicle.
