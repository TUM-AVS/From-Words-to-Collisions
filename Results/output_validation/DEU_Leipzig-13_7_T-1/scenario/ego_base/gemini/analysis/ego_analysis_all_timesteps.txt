Obstacle 3254 is in the Collision state with the ego vehicle, indicating a collision has occurred in this timestep. Obstacle 3261 is now longitudinally aligned with the ego vehicle, and although it's very close laterally (1.96m), its high longitudinal velocity (10.40 m/s) suggests it may pose an extreme risk in the next timestep. Other obstacles are not considered high risk currently.

**Risk Levels and Definitions:**
<Collision (Score: 0)>: Actual collision has occurred or is unavoidable within the next timestep.
<Extreme Risk (Score: 1)>: Immediate collision or very high likelihood of impact. Urgent action is required.
<High Risk (Score: 2)>: Close to collision or highly probable collision path. Needs prompt attention and quick manoeuvring.
<Medium Risk (Score: 3)>: Moderate collision risk but manageable with timely reactions and proper strategies.
<Low Risk (Score: 4)>: Minimal collision risk. The situation is controllable with sufficient time to react.
<Negligible Risk (Score: 5)>: No significant collision risk. Obstacles are either moving away or far enough not to interfere.
