### Safety analysis for timestep 3.1s - 4.0s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

**Methodology:**

Given the complexity of calculating precise TTC with acceleration, a simplified approach is used.  We analyze the trend in distance and velocity. If distances are decreasing and closing velocities are present, we infer a collision risk. The magnitudes of distance and velocity, coupled with the directional information, allow us to estimate the risk level.
