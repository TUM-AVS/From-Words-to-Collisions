Let me analyze each obstacle at the most recent timestep (4.0 seconds) and assess collision risks:

1. Obstacle 3243 (Front-right):
   - Adjusted distances: longitudinal 15.25m, lateral -10.67m
   - Moving toward ego longitudinally (-3.77m/s) but away laterally (-5.04m/s)
   - TTC longitudinal: 15.25/3.77 ≈ 4.04s (Low Risk)
   - MDC: Lateral distance increasing → No Risk
   - Overall Risk: 4 (Low Risk)

2. Obstacle 3245 (Front-right):
   - Adjusted distances: longitudinal 6.06m, lateral -25.40m
   - Very slowly approaching longitudinally (-0.14m/s), moving toward laterally (1.33m/s)
   - TTC lateral: 25.40/1.33 ≈ 19.1s (No Risk)
   - MDC: Both distances large → No Risk
   - Overall Risk: 5 (No Risk)

3. Obstacle 3247 (Front-right):
   - Adjusted distances: longitudinal 4.14m, lateral -22.20m
   - Approaching longitudinally (-1.52m/s), no lateral movement
   - TTC longitudinal: 4.14/1.52 ≈ 2.72s (Medium Risk)
   - MDC: Large lateral distance → No Risk
   - Overall Risk: 3 (Medium Risk)

4. Obstacle 3252 (Rear-right):
   - Adjusted distances: longitudinal -2.40m, lateral -23.35m
   - Moving away longitudinally (-1.52m/s), no lateral movement
   - TTC: Negative (moving away) → No Risk
   - MDC: Large distances → No Risk
   - Overall Risk: 5 (No Risk)

5. Obstacle 3254 (Collision):
   - Adjusted distances: longitudinal 0.00m, lateral 0.00m
   - Exact alignment in both dimensions with closing velocity (7.66m/s longitudinally)
   - This indicates an ACTUAL COLLISION occurring now
   - Overall Risk: 0 (Collision)

6. Obstacle 3256 (Front-left):
   - Adjusted distances: longitudinal 22.80m, lateral 3.95m
   - Moving away in both dimensions → No Risk
   - Overall Risk: 5 (No Risk)

7. Obstacle 3260 (Behind):
   - Adjusted distances: longitudinal -16.78m, lateral 0.00m
   - Approaching from behind (7.81m/s) but still distant
   - TTC: 16.78/7.81 ≈ 2.15s (Medium Risk)
   - MDC: Large distance → No Risk
   - Overall Risk: 3 (Medium Risk)

8. Obstacle 3261 (Left):
   - Adjusted distances: longitudinal 0.00m, lateral 1.96m
   - Side-by-side alignment with slight lateral approach (-0.26m/s)
   - TTC lateral: 1.96/0.26 ≈ 7.54s (No Risk)
   - MDC: Safe lateral distance → Low Risk
   - Overall Risk: 4 (Low Risk)

Trajectory Analysis:
- Obstacle 3254 shows clear collision at 4.0s (distance reaches 0.00m in both dimensions)
- All other obstacles maintain safe distances or are moving away
- No extreme risks (score 1) besides the actual collision
