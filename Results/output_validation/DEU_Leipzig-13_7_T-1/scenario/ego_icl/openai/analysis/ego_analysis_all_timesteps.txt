**Obstacle Analysis:**

1. **Obstacle 3243 (Front-right)**
   - Adjusted longitudinal distance: 15.25 m
   - Adjusted lateral distance: -10.67 m
   - Relative velocity: longitudinal -3.77 m/s, lateral -5.04 m/s
   - Motion: Driving toward the ego car longitudinally, moving away laterally to the right
   
   **TTC (longitudinal):** |15.25 m / 3.77 m/s| ≈ 4.04 seconds
   
   **TTC (lateral):** Not applicable as the obstacle is moving away laterally

   **MDC:**  Calculated based on trajectory indicates no collision as lateral distance is increasing.
   
   **Risk Assessment:** 
   - Longitudinal TTC > 3.0s, lateral direction moving away (increasing the distance), classified as Low Risk (4).

2. **Obstacle 3245 (Front-right)**
   - Adjusted longitudinal distance: 6.06 m
   - Adjusted lateral distance: -25.40 m
   - Relative velocity: longitudinal -0.14 m/s, lateral 1.33 m/s
   - Motion: Driving toward the ego car longitudinally, driving toward laterally from the right
   
   **TTC:** Not directly applicable due to very low longitudinal velocity.
   
   **MDC:** Both longitudinal and lateral paths diverge significantly; no imminent collision.
   
   **Risk Assessment:** Low longitudinal relative approach and lateral increase indicate No Risk (5).

3. **Obstacle 3247 (Front-right)**
   - Adjusted longitudinal distance: 4.14 m
   - Adjusted lateral distance: -22.20 m
   - Relative velocity: longitudinal -1.52 m/s, lateral -0.00 m/s
   - Motion: Driving toward the ego car longitudinally
   
   **TTC (longitudinal):** |4.14 m / 1.52 m/s| ≈ 2.72 seconds
   
   **TTC (lateral):** Not applicable (no lateral movement)
   
   **MDC:** With stationary lateral movement, close longitudinal distance, and negative approach, expected to reduce.
   
   **Risk Assessment:** Medium Risk (3) due to longitudinal TTC < 3.0s.
   
4. **Obstacle 3252 (Rear-right)**
   - Longitudinal distance: -2.40 m
   - Lateral distance: -23.35 m
   - Relative velocity: longitudinal -1.52 m/s, lateral -0.00 m/s
   - Motion: Moving away longitudinally
   
   **Risk Assessment:** Due to moving away longitudinally, diverging paths suggest No Risk (5).

5. **Obstacle 3254 (In collision)**
   - Adjusted longitudinal and lateral distances: 0.00 m each
   - Relative velocity: longitudinal 7.66 m/s, lateral -0.21 m/s
   - Motion: Exact alignment in both dimensions
   
   **Risk Assessment:** Collision (0) as distances are zero in both dimensions.

6. **Obstacle 3256 (Front-left)**
   - Adjusted longitudinal distance: 22.80 m
   - Adjusted lateral distance: 3.95 m
   - Relative velocity: longitudinal 9.60 m/s, lateral 1.47 m/s
   - Motion: Moving away both longitudinally and laterally
   
   **Risk Assessment:** Both distances increase, posing No Risk (5).

7. **Obstacle 3260 (Behind)**
   - Adjusted longitudinal distance: -16.78 m
   - Adjusted lateral distance: 0.00 m
   - Relative velocity: longitudinal 7.81 m/s, lateral -0.83 m/s
   - Motion: Approach from behind
   
   **TTC:** Not directly indicative, motion poses Low Risk (4) due to alignment and speed, but not immediate.

8. **Obstacle 3261 (Left)**
   - Adjusted longitudinal: 0.00 m
   - Adjusted lateral: 1.96 m
   - Relative velocity: longitudinal 10.40 m/s, lateral -0.26 m/s
   - Motion: Approaches laterally from left
   
   **TTC:** Close lateral approach with potential future risk.
   - **Risk Assessment:** Close proximity lateral with approach suggests Medium Risk (3).

**Conclusion:**

From the above analysis, Obstacle 3254 is in collision with the ego vehicle as indicated by zero distance in both dimensions and respective motion vectors.
