Here's the collision risk analysis:

**Obstacle 3071:** This obstacle is in a different lane (392) than the ego vehicle (393), and although its velocity is higher than the ego vehicle's, the y-coordinates suggest a diverging trajectory.  Therefore, the risk is relatively low.  Risk score: 4.

**Obstacle 3072:** This obstacle is significantly further away and in a different lane (186). It poses no immediate threat. Risk score: 5.

**Obstacle 3074:** This obstacle is in the same lane (393) as the ego vehicle and is relatively close.  While initially, it's behind the ego vehicle, its deceleration suggests the ego vehicle might approach it. Continued monitoring is needed, but the risk is currently medium. Risk score: 3.

**Obstacle 3075:** This obstacle is in a different lane and its trajectory doesn't suggest an immediate intersection with the ego vehicle's path. Risk score: 5.

Based on the provided data, no obstacle poses an immediate collision risk (score 0 or 1). Obstacle 3074 requires attention due to its proximity and being in the same lane.
