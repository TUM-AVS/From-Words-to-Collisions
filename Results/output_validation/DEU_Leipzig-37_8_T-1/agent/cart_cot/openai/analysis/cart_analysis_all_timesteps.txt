### Analysis for Risk Levels

- **Ego Vehicle (ID: 3073)** is very slow, with a velocity decreasing from 0.7037 to 0.2189 over the timesteps. This low speed implies low maneuverability and requires caution when obstacles approach.

- **Obstacle 3071**: This obstacle, starting at 9.5765 m/s, accelerates throughout and reaches 11.1513 m/s at the last observed timestep. It is in a different lanelet but moves at high speed and remains in close proximity in the negative y-direction at (-142.3301, -265.1347). The high velocity differentials and proximities can be a cause for extreme risk, considering potential lane-cross scenarios.

- **Obstacle 3074**: It operates in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle and moves slower at 3.754 m/s, with its trajectory closely parallel to the ego vehicle. Given its same-lane motion and proximity, yet lower speed than obstacle 3071, it represents a high-risk scenario.
