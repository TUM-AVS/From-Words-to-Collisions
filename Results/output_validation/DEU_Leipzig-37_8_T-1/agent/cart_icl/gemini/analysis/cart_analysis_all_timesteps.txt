Obstacle 3071 is moving significantly faster than the ego vehicle and is in the adjacent lane. Although not immediately dangerous, its high speed and proximity warrant attention, especially given its acceleration.

Obstacle 3074 is in the same lane as the ego vehicle and moving slower. It's moderately close, but the risk is low given its deceleration and the ego vehicle's slower speed.

Obstacle 3075 has crossed into lanelet 2060 from 2057, posing a potential risk if its trajectory intersects with the ego vehicle's path. Its rapid heading changes and moderate speed require monitoring. The obstacle is also laterally close to the ego vehicle. This situation requires careful monitoring and assessment.
