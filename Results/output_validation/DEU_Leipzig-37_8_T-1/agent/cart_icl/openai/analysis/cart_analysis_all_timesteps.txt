### Analysis:

At the most recent timestep (2.9 seconds), I'll evaluate each obstacle in relation to the ego vehicle, focusing on both their positional proximity and relative velocities. Here's a detailed risk assessment for each obstacle:

1. **Obstacle 3071 (at 2.9s):**  
   - **Position:** (-142.3301, -265.1347)  
   - **Relative to Ego:** Considerably ahead and slightly to the left.
   - **Relative Velocity (Approaching):** With relative longitudinal velocity significantly high since the ego vehicle is very slow moving.
   - **Lateral Distance:** Minimal safe lateral distance between the two.
   - **Analysis:** Given its velocity and small lateral distance, this obstacle poses a **High Risk** as it is in the adjacent lanelet, slightly heading towards the ego's lane. **Overall Risk Score: 2**.

2. **Obstacle 3074 (at 2.9s):**  
   - **Position:** (-135.5464, -263.1332)  
   - **Relative to Ego:** Behind and in a similar lanelet region.
   - **Relative Velocity (Approaching):** Not substantially different but is on converging path.
   - **Analysis:** Given it shares the same lanelet and converging, it represents a **Medium Risk** given its distance but needs monitoring. **Overall Risk Score: 3**.

3. **Obstacle 3075 (at 2.9s):**  
   - **Position:** (-127.7211, -248.0017)  
   - **Relative to Ego:** Ahead and to the side, moving parallel.
   - **Analysis:** Different lanelet and given the distance, no immediate threat. **Overall Risk Score: 4**.

### Conclusion:
- **Obstacle 3071** stands out because of its closing velocity and lane positioning relative to the ego vehicle, leading to a **High Risk** score.
