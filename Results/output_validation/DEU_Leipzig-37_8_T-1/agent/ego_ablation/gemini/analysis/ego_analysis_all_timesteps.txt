At t=2.9s:
- **Obstacle 3071 (Rear-left):** This obstacle is moving away longitudinally and slightly toward the ego laterally.  Given the distances (-6.85m longitudinal, 1.88m lateral), both TTC and MDC are high, indicating negligible risk. Score: 5

- **Obstacle 3074 (Behind):**  This obstacle is very close longitudinally (-0.70m) and directly behind the ego (0.00m lateral). This poses a high risk of collision if the ego were to brake suddenly or reverse. The low longitudinal distance suggests a very low TTC. While MDC is slightly higher due to the zero lateral offset, it still represents a significant risk. Score: 2.

- **Obstacle 3075 (Front-left):**  This obstacle is approaching the ego both longitudinally (6.61m) and laterally (3.26m). The decreasing distances suggest moderate TTC and MDC values. This represents a medium risk. Score: 3
