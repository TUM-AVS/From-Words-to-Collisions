At t=2.9s:
- **Obstacle 3071 (Rear-left):**  Longitudinal distance is increasing (moving away), and lateral distance is small but not alarming. No immediate collision risk. Risk score: 3 (Medium Risk)
- **Obstacle 3074 (Behind):** Longitudinal distance is very small (-0.70m) and closing, indicating a high risk of rear-end collision. Risk score: 2 (High Risk)
- **Obstacle 3075 (Front-left):**  Both longitudinal and lateral distances are decreasing, meaning it's approaching the ego vehicle. However, the distances are not critically small yet. Risk score: 3 (Medium Risk)

Risk Levels:
0: Collision - Physical contact occurred or unavoidable
1: Extreme Risk - Immediate collision likely
2: High Risk - Close to collision, needs quick action
3: Medium Risk - Manageable with proper reaction
4: Low Risk - Minimal risk, sufficient time to react
5: Negligible Risk - No significant risk
