### Safety analysis for timestep 2.9s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

It's crucial to note that the provided scenario lacks crucial information for accurate TTC and MDC calculation.  Specifically, we need the ego vehicle's dimensions and those of the obstacles to correctly adjust the longitudinal and lateral distances. The provided "real distances" seem to represent center-to-center distances, which aren't directly usable for collision risk assessment.  We need distances to the closest points of the obstacle and ego vehicle.

Given this limitation, the analysis below is based on the available center-to-center distances and relative velocities/accelerations, thus representing an approximation of the true risk.  The scores assigned reflect this uncertainty.

**Assumptions for Demonstration:**

* To demonstrate the analysis process, I'll assume a combined ego and obstacle size adjustment value to be subtracted from the "real distance," as we lack individual vehicle dimensions. This value is arbitrary without more information.
* Let's assume this combined size adjustment is 1 meter for longitudinal and 1 meter for lateral distances. The adjusted values (adjusted_d_long and adjusted_d_lat) will be calculated as follows :


adjusted_d_long = |DTClong| - 1.0
adjusted_d_lat = |DTClat| - 1.0

Obstacle 3071 adjusted_d_long = 6.85-1 = 5.85m
Obstacle 3071 adjusted_d_lat = 6.85-1 = 5.85m

Obstacle 3074 adjusted_d_long = 0.70 -1 = -0.3m (Since we take absolute value and we account for the negative values 0.3m MDC. Negative TTC indicates a potential collision)
Obstacle 3074 adjusted_d_lat = 0.70 -1 = -0.3m 

Obstacle 3075 adjusted_d_long = 6.61-1 = 5.61m
Obstacle 3075 adjusted_d_lat = 6.61-1 = 5.61m




### Obstacle Analysis:

**- Obstacle ID: 3071**
    - Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is moving away longitudinally and  laterally to the left with a safe adjusted distance of 5.85m both longitudinally and laterally.
    - Distance safety score: 5
    - Time Risk reason:  Relative velocity suggests separation.
    - Time safety score: 5
    - Overall Risk score: 5

**- Obstacle ID: 3074**
    - Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is very close and approaching from behind longitudinally,adjusted distance indicates collision range (-0.3m means collision imminent), and almost zero lateral adjusted distance (-0.3m means collision imminent). High risk of rear-end collision.
    - Distance safety score: 0
    - Time Risk reason: The relative longitudinal velocity is positive, meaning the obstacle is closing in from behind. Without proper ego vehicle reaction, a collision is highly probable within the next timestep. Negative adjusted distance.
    - Time safety score: 0
    - Overall Risk score: 0

**- Obstacle ID: 3075**
    - Distance Risk reason: Obstacle approaching diagonally from the front-left.  Moderate adjusted longitudinal and lateral distances (5.61m) require attention but aren't immediately dangerous.
    - Distance safety score: 5
    - Time Risk reason: Negative relative longitudinal and lateral velocities indicate the obstacle is moving towards the ego vehicle. Continuous monitoring is necessary.
    - Time safety score: 3
    - Overall Risk score: 3
