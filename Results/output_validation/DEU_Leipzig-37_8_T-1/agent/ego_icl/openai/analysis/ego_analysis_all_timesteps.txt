### Obstacle-by-Obstacle Analysis

#### Obstacle 3071:
- **Position and Trajectory:**
  - At 2.9 seconds, it is in the "Rear-left" of the ego car with longitudinal distance -6.85 m and lateral 1.88 m.
  - Longitudinally moving away (-11.37 m/s); laterally approaching (-0.01 m/s).
  - Exact alignment longitudinally, but moving away overall.

- **TTC and MDC:**
  - **Longitudinal:** Since moving away, no risk of collision (negative relative velocity).
  - **Lateral:** MDC mainly lateral; decreasing very slowly.

- **Risk Assessment:**
  - **TTC:** Irrelevant for longitudinal moving away.
  - **MDC:** Far beyond 5.0 m laterally and increasing longitudinally.
  - **Conclusion:** No collision risk, negligible risk (5).

#### Obstacle 3072:
- **Position and Trajectory:**
  - At 2.9 seconds, in the "Front-right" of the ego car with adjusted longitudinal 23.06 m and lateral -7.70 m.
  - Moving away longitudinally (5.88 m/s) and laterally (-4.82 m/s).

- **TTC and MDC:**
  - **Longitudinal and Lateral:** Both moving away.
  - **TTC & MDC:** Both dimensions indicate no collision. 

- **Risk Assessment:**
  - **TTC/Lateral Risk:** No risk due to diverging path.
  - **Conclusion:** Negligible risk (5).

#### Obstacle 3074:
- **Position and Trajectory:**
  - At 2.9 seconds, it is "Behind" the ego with longitudinal -0.70 m and lateral 0.00 m.
  - Approaching longitudinally (3.54 m/s).

- **TTC and MDC:**
  - **Longitudinal:** TTC = |0.70 / 3.54| ≈ 0.20s (extremely high risk).
  - **Lateral:** Perfect alignment, emphasizing longitudinal risk.

- **Risk Assessment:**
  - **TTC:** Extreme risk confirmed based on rapid approach.
  - **Conclusion:** Extreme collision risk (1). Needs immediate action.

#### Obstacle 3075:
- **Position and Trajectory:**
  - At 2.9 seconds, in the "Front-left" with adjusted longitudinal 6.61 m and lateral 3.26 m.
  - Approaching longitudinally (-5.87 m/s) and laterally (-3.35 m/s).

- **TTC and MDC:**
  - **Longitudinal TTC:** |6.61 / 5.87| ≈ 1.13s.
  - **Lateral TTC:** |3.26 / 3.35| ≈ 0.97s.
  - **MDC:** Both metrics indicate High risk primarily (near medium-high risk boundary).

- **Risk Assessment:**
  - **TTC (Longitudinal):** Medium-high transitionally.
  - **TTC (Lateral):** High closely transitioning to medium.
  - **Conclusion:** High risk (2).

### Conclusion

Based on my analysis, the obstacles are ranked based on the risk scores assigned above. It is crucial to address the risk from Obstacle 3074 immediately due to its extreme risk profile.

```json
{
  "CollisionObstacle": {
    "ObstacleID": "N/A",
    "OverallRiskScore": "N/A"
  },
  "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {
    "ObstacleID": "3074",
    "OverallRiskScore": "1"
  },
  "HighRiskObstacle": {
    "ObstacleID": "3075",
    "OverallRiskScore": "2"
  }  
}
```

This analysis accurately identifies the necessity for immediate evasive actions regarding Obstacle 3074 due to its approaching trajectory, potentially causing a collision in a very short timeframe.
