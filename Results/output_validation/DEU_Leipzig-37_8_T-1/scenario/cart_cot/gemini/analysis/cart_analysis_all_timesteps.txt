### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

- Obstacle ID: 3071.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 3071.0 is in a different lanelet (392.0) than the ego vehicle (393.0).  Over the past several timesteps, this obstacle has been moving away from the ego vehicle laterally and longitudinally.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: The obstacle's velocity and acceleration are not directly relevant to collision risk due to the lateral separation and differing lanelets.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 3072.0
- Distance Risk reason: This obstacle is in a different lanelet (186.0) and is far from the ego vehicle.  The historical trajectory shows it moving further away.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason:  Given the lateral distance and direction of travel, the relative velocity and acceleration pose no immediate threat.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 3074.0
- Distance Risk reason: This obstacle is in the same lanelet (393.0) as the ego vehicle and relatively close behind.  Analyzing the past timesteps shows the distance between the vehicles is decreasing.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: The ego vehicle is decelerating more rapidly than obstacle 3074.0, increasing the risk of a rear-end collision.  
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3

- Obstacle ID: 3075.0
- Distance Risk reason:  This obstacle is located in a different lanelet and poses no immediate risk due to sufficient lateral separation. The historical data confirms this obstacle remains in a different lane.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason:  Although the obstacle's velocity is higher than the ego vehicle's, the lateral separation and different lanelets mitigate any time-related risks.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5


### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. **Most critical obstacles:** Obstacle 3074.0 presents the most significant risk, being in the same lanelet and closing in on the ego vehicle. 
2. **Trajectory Analysis:** Over the 10 timesteps, 3074.0 consistently remains behind the ego vehicle in the same lanelet while reducing the longitudinal distance.
3. **Relative Motion:** Both vehicles are moving in the same direction.  The ego vehicle is decelerating more rapidly.
4. **Collision Imminence:** While a collision hasn't occurred yet, the closing distance and velocity difference suggest a moderate risk of a rear-end collision in the near future if the ego vehicle continues to decelerate at a higher rate than 3074.0.
5. **Reasoning:** The consistent trajectory of 3074.0 within the same lane, coupled with the decreasing inter-vehicle distance and ego vehicle's higher deceleration, indicates a potential rear-end collision risk if the current trend continues. The other obstacles maintain safe lateral separation and are not considered critical.
