### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 3071.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is in a different lane and moving away from the ego vehicle.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason:  The relative velocity and trajectories indicate no imminent collision risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 3072.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is in a different lane and considerably far from the ego vehicle.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason:  Relative velocity and trajectories suggest no immediate threat.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 3074.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is in the same lane but consistently behind the ego vehicle.  The distance is decreasing slightly but not drastically over the analyzed timesteps.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Ego vehicle is decelerating while obstacle 3074 is also decelerating, and its velocity is higher than the ego. Requires monitoring to make sure there's no collision.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- Obstacle ID: 3075.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is in a different lane and moving away from the ego vehicle.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason:  Trajectory and relative velocity show no risk of collision.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5


### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. **No immediate collisions:**  At the most recent timestep (3.1s), no obstacle occupies the same position as the ego vehicle.
2. **Obstacle 3074 requires monitoring:** It's in the same lane and the closest, but currently behind and also decelerating.  Though a low risk,  future predictions are necessary to ensure continued safety.
3. **Other Obstacles pose no immediate risk:** Obstacles 3071, 3072, and 3075 are in different lanes and their trajectories don't intersect with the ego vehicle's in the short term.

Therefore, this is **not** a collision scenario at the current timestep.

  "CollisionObstacles": [],
  "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null,
  "ScenarioAnalysis": {
    "IsCollisionScenario": false,
    "Reasoning": "No obstacle shares the same position as the ego vehicle at the most recent timestep. While obstacle 3074 is in the same lane and requires monitoring due to proximity and similar orientation, the current trajectories and velocities suggest no immediate collision."
