### Obstacle Analysis:

#### Obstacle ID: 3071
- **Distance Risk reason:** Obstacle is in a different lanelet but very close at a lateral distance of approximately 11.87 units away. High closing speed from historical velocity and acceleration trends.
- **Distance safety score:** 3 (Medium Risk)

- **Time Risk reason:** High speed and positive acceleration indicate a potential path convergence, but the ego and obstacle are not directly aligned longitudinally. However, the velocity trend is increasing; therefore, a medium risk is appropriate.
- **Time safety score:** 2 (High Risk)

- **Overall Risk score:** 3 (Medium Risk)

#### Obstacle ID: 3074
- **Distance Risk reason:** Same lanelet and close proximity to Ego vehicle, approximately 3.98 units away. The slow movement of the ego and obstacle indicates room to manage.
- **Distance safety score:** 2 (High Risk)

- **Time Risk reason:** The velocity and acceleration have been steady with minor changes. Potential risk due to shared lanelet and close positioning over time.
- **Time safety score:** 2 (High Risk)

- **Overall Risk score:** 2 (High Risk)

#### Obstacle ID: 3075
- **Distance Risk reason:** Different lanelet, farther position at approximately 11.88 units, moving away from the ego vehicle.
- **Distance safety score:** 4 (Low Risk)

- **Time Risk reason:** Trend shows steady velocity and minor acceleration changes, moving consistently in its lane, no immediate collision path to the ego vehicle.
- **Time safety score:** 4 (Low Risk)

- **Overall Risk score:** 4 (Low Risk)

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
The scenario does not indicate a collision, as no obstacles are expected to intersect with the ego vehicle immediately. While there's noticeable risk due to nearby obstacles and high velocities (3071, 3074), the vehicle trajectories over time show manageable conditions without immediate collision paths.
