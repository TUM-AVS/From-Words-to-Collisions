Obstacle 3074 is in collision with the ego vehicle as indicated by a longitudinal and lateral distance of 0.0 m.  Obstacle 3075 shows a high risk of collision with the ego vehicle. It is located 5.47m in front and 2.72m to the left, and closing at -6.32 m/s longitudinally and -2.30 m/s laterally. Although the MDC and TTC are not explicitly provided, the short distances and negative relative velocities suggest a high probability of collision within the next few seconds if the current trajectories are maintained.
