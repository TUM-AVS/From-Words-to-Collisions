### Obstacle-by-Obstacle Analysis (Most Recent Timestep: 3.1 seconds)

---

#### **Obstacle 3071 (Rear-left)**
- **Adjusted Distance**: Longitudinal: -9.14 m (behind), Lateral: 1.96 m (left)
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal: -11.65 m/s (moving away), Lateral: 0.06 m/s (moving away)
- **Motion**: Moving away longitudinally and laterally to the left.
- **TTC**: Not applicable (relative velocities are negative/diverging).
- **MDC**: Lateral distance is stable at ~1.9m (Low Risk).
- **Risk**: 5 (No Risk). No collision path.

#### **Obstacle 3074 (Collision)**
- **Adjusted Distance**: Longitudinal: 0.00 m, Lateral: 0.00 m.
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal: 3.52 m/s (approaching), Lateral: -0.02 m/s (negligible).
- **Motion**: Exact alignment in both dimensions with closing longitudinal velocity.
- **TTC**: 0.00 m / 3.52 m/s = 0 seconds (Collision occurring).
- **MDC**: 0.00 m (Collision occurring).
- **Risk**: 0 (Collision). Direct overlap with closing velocity.

#### **Obstacle 3075 (Front-left)**
- **Adjusted Distance**: Longitudinal: 5.47 m (front), Lateral: 2.72 m (left).
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal: -6.32 m/s (approaching), Lateral: -2.30 m/s (approaching).
- **Motion**: Approaching diagonally from front-left.
- **TTC Longitudinal**: 5.47 m / 6.32 m/s ≈ 0.87 seconds (High Risk).
- **TTC Lateral**: 2.72 m / 2.30 m/s ≈ 1.18 seconds (Medium Risk).
- **MDC**: Projected minimum distance is decreasing but still >1.0m (Medium Risk).
- **Risk**: 2 (High Risk). Converging trajectory but not imminent.

### Trajectory Analysis
- **Obstacle 3074**: 
  - At 3.0s: Longitudinal distance was -0.35m (behind), closing at 3.51 m/s.
  - At 3.1s: Reaches 0.00m (collision) with continued closing velocity.
  - Clear collision trajectory confirmed.

- **Obstacle 3075**: 
  - Consistently approaching but lateral distance remains >2.7m. No immediate threat.

### Final Determination
This is a **collision scenario** due to Obstacle 3074 overlapping with the ego vehicle (0.00m in both dimensions) with closing velocity.
