* **Obstacle 3071 (Rear-Left):**  This obstacle has been consistently moving away from the ego vehicle longitudinally and slightly towards it laterally across all timesteps. At the last timestep (3.1s), it is 9.14m behind and 1.96m to the left. The longitudinal motion clearly indicates no risk.  The lateral motion, while slightly converging, is at a safe distance. The lateral velocity is actually moving slightly *away* from the ego.
    * **TTC (Longitudinal):** N/A (diverging)
    * **TTC (Lateral):** N/A (diverging)
    * **MDC:** Approximately 1.96m (using primarily lateral distance as it's the smaller of the two). This would suggest a Medium risk.
    * **Overall Risk:** Low (4) - Due to diverging longitudinal trajectory and safe lateral distance.

* **Obstacle 3074 (Collision/Behind):** This obstacle has been approaching the ego vehicle from behind throughout the scenario. At the final timestamp (3.1s), the reported distance is 0.00m longitudinally and 0.00m laterally which along with the motion description means the collision occurs now.
    * **TTC (Longitudinal):** 0 seconds.
    * **TTC (Lateral):** N/A. Not Applicable because of the 0 lateral relative speed.
    * **MDC:** 0.00m
    * **Overall Risk:** Collision (0)

* **Obstacle 3075 (Front-Left):** This obstacle has been approaching the ego vehicle diagonally from the front-left. At the last timestep, it is 5.47m ahead longitudinally and 2.72m left laterally. Both distances are decreasing across the timesteps.
    * **TTC (Longitudinal):** 5.47m / 6.32 m/s ≈ 0.87 seconds.
    * **TTC (Lateral):** 2.72m / 2.30 m/s ≈ 1.18 seconds.
    * **MDC:** Approximately 2.72m.
    * **Overall Risk:** High (2) - Due to the relatively short TTC (under 1 second) despite a moderate MDC.

Since Obstacle 3074 is in a collision state, this is a collision scenario.
