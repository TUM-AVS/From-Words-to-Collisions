### Obstacle-by-Obstacle Analysis

#### **Obstacle 3071**
- **Position**: Rear-left of the ego vehicle at t = 3.1 s
- **Adjusted Distances**: Longitudinal = -9.14 m, Lateral = 1.96 m
- **Relative Velocities**: Longitudinal = -11.65 m/s, Lateral = 0.06 m/s
- **Trajectory and Motion Analysis**:
  - **Motion**: Moving away longitudinally, slightly moving towards laterally
  - Since the obstacle is moving away longitudinally, the collision risk is minimal.
  - The lateral movement is negligible.
- **TTC and MDC**:
  - **Longitudinal TTC**: Not applicable as it's moving away.
  - **Lateral TTC**: Similarly, not critical as there is no substantial closing movement.
  - **MDC**: Since both distances are increasing or stable, no collision path is asserted.

- **Risk Score**: 
  - **TTC & MDC** indicate no convergence, thus:
    - **Risk Score**: 5 (No Risk)

#### **Obstacle 3074**
- **Position**: Directly "in Collision" at t = 3.1 s
- **Adjusted Distances**: Longitudinal = 0.00 m, Lateral = 0.00 m
- **Relative Velocities**: Longitudinal = 3.52 m/s, Lateral = -0.02 m/s
- **Trajectory and Motion Analysis**:
  - **Motion**: Exact alignment in both dimensions
  - Given the zero distances and closing velocity longitudinally, along with minimal lateral movement, this currently represents a collision.
- **TTC and MDC**:
  - **Longitudinal TTC**: Not applicable as collision is occurring.
  - **Lateral TTC**: Not applicable as collision is occurring.
  - **MDC**: 0 meters, indicating collision.

- **Risk Score**:
  - **Collision identified through 0m in both dimensions**:
    - **Risk Score**: 0 (Collision)

#### **Obstacle 3075**
- **Position**: Front-left of the ego vehicle at t = 3.1 s
- **Adjusted Distances**: Longitudinal = 5.47 m, Lateral = 2.72 m
- **Relative Velocities**: Longitudinal = -6.32 m/s, Lateral = -2.30 m/s
- **Trajectory and Motion Analysis**:
  - **Motion**: Driving towards the ego car longitudinally and laterally from the left.
  - Both distance components are reducing, with significant closing speed.
- **TTC and MDC**:
  - **Longitudinal TTC**: Approximately 5.47 / 6.32 = 0.87 seconds
  - **Lateral TTC**: Approximately 2.72 / 2.30 = 1.18 seconds
  - **Combined Trajectory MDC**: Is in reducing trajectory, critical within a short period.

- **Risk Score**:
  - **TTC & MDC** indicate imminent convergence:
    - **Risk Score**: 2 (High Risk, predominantly due to longitudinal convergence in tight proximity)

### Collision Scenario Determination

- **Collision Detected with Obstacle 3074**, given both distances are zero with closing velocity in real-time sequence.
- **Extreme collision risk for Obstacle 3075**, with reducing paths in a constrained timeframe.
