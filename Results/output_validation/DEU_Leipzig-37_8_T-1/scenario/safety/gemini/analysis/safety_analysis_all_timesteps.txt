### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 3071
- Relative Direction: Rear-left
- Distance Risk Reason: The obstacle is moving away longitudinally (DTClong = -9.14m) and laterally (DTClat=1.96m, starting at 1.9m and slightly increasing over time).  The negative longitudinal distance indicates it's behind the ego vehicle.
- Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 5
- Lateral Distance Safety Score: 3
- Overall Distance Safety Score: 4.0  (5 * 0.5 + 3 * 0.5)
- Time Risk Reason: TTClong is inf, indicating no longitudinal collision risk. TTClat is also inf showing no lateral risk in the most recent timestamp and confirming the trajectory.
- Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 5
- Lateral Time Safety Score: 5
- Overall Time Safety Score: 5.0 (5 * 0.5 + 5 * 0.5)
- Overall Risk Score: 5 (0.5*4 + 0.5*5 = 4.5, rounded to 5)

- Obstacle ID: 3074
- Relative Direction: Behind
- Distance Risk Reason: The obstacle has collided with the ego vehicle (DTClong = 0.00 m, DTClat = 0.00 m)
- Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 0
- Lateral Distance Safety Score: 0
- Overall Distance Safety Score: 0.0 (0 * 1 + 0 * (1-1))
- Time Risk Reason: TTClong and TTClat are both 0, indicating a collision. The previous timesteps show a decreasing TTClong, leading to the collision.
- Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 0
- Lateral Time Safety Score: 0
- Overall Time Safety Score: 0.0 (0 * 1 + 0 * (1-1))
- Overall Risk Score: 0 (0.5*0 + 0.5*0 = 0)

- Obstacle ID: 3075
- Relative Direction: Front-left
- Distance Risk Reason: DTClong (5.47m) is greater than 5 and shows the obstacle is moving closer through past time steps. DTClat is 2.72m, placing it in medium risk laterally. 
- Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 4
- Lateral Distance Safety Score: 3
- Overall Distance Safety Score: 3.5 (4 * 0.5 + 3 * 0.5)
- Time Risk Reason: TTClong is 0.86s, indicating extreme risk. TTClat is 1.19s.
- Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 1
- Lateral Time Safety Score: 3
- Overall Time Safety Score: 2.0 (1 * 0.5 + 3 * 0.5)
- Overall Risk Score: 3 (0.5 * 3.5 + 0.5 * 2 = 2.75, rounded to 3)
