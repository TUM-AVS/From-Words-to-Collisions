Here's the collision risk analysis:

**Obstacle 3253:**  This obstacle is stationary and located laterally far from the ego vehicle's trajectory.  It poses no immediate risk. *Risk Score: 5*

**Obstacle 3255:** Similar to 3253, this obstacle is stationary and poses no risk due to its lateral distance from the ego vehicle. *Risk Score: 5*

**Obstacle 3256:** This obstacle is moving and shows a decreasing velocity. Initially, it seemed like there might be an eventual collision risk, but the latest provided positions show its y-coordinate is consistently above the ego's. *Risk Score: 4*. It warrants continued monitoring but isn't extreme or high risk right now.

**Obstacle 3261:** This obstacle is moving and its y-coordinate is decreasing, approaching the ego vehicle.  The distance is closing but given current velocities and trajectories, a collision isn't imminent in the next couple of seconds. *Risk Score: 3*.  This warrants monitoring.

**Obstacle 3263:** Stationary and laterally distanced from the ego vehicle. *Risk Score: 5*.

**Obstacle 3265:** This obstacle has a high velocity and is approaching the ego vehicle's y-coordinate range rapidly from the positive y-axis.  Based on the current trajectories and speeds, a collision is possible within a couple of seconds. It is classified as extreme risk as the y-coordinate of the obstacle is almost the same as the ego vehicle. *Risk Score: 1*.
