Obstacle 3265 shows a concerning trend. Its high velocity and acceleration, coupled with its trajectory, suggest a possible collision with the ego vehicle if the current trends continue.  A more detailed analysis involving TTC and MDC calculations would be needed to confirm this. The rapid change in the y-coordinate of Obstacle 3265 (-4.9332 at t=5.1s from -4.3402 at t=5.0s, -3.7512 at t=4.9s) indicates its high speed and potential risk. Although it poses the most imminent threat, it's important to note that other obstacles might become risky soon, and thus require continuous monitoring.
