### Risk Analysis

Let's evaluate each obstacle at the most recent timestep (5.1 seconds):

1. **Obstacle 3253.0**:
   - Position: (-375.7721, 12.8873)
   - Velocity: 0.0
   - No movement, no immediate collision risk.

2. **Obstacle 3255.0**:
   - Position: (-390.3855, 23.8008)
   - Velocity: 0.0
   - No movement, no immediate collision risk.

3. **Obstacle 3256.0**:
   - Position: (-371.4882, 24.8545)
   - Velocity: 0.1999
   - Moving away from ego vehicle, low risk.

4. **Obstacle 3261.0**:
   - Position: (-377.264, -1.3499)
   - Velocity: 4.0818
   - Heading towards the ego's position but on a different path; high speed might become problematic if trajectory changes significantly; medium risk.

5. **Obstacle 3263.0**:
   - Position: (-357.4847, 1.8047)
   - Velocity: 0.0
   - Stationary, no immediate collision risk.

6. **Obstacle 3265.0**:
   - Position: (-354.609, -4.9332)
   - Velocity: 10.1423
   - Fast-moving and possibly in the same lane direction, potential risk increases if no change in trajectory; high risk.

**Notable and High-Risk Situations**:
- **Obstacle 3265.0**: Due to its high velocity and trajectory, it poses a potential high risk as it moves in a direction aligned with the ego vehicle's path, possibly requiring evasive action.
