### Analysis of Risky Obstacles:

1. **Obstacle 3261**:
   - **Position**: (-377.264, -1.3499) at 5.1s, moving towards ego's lane (lanelet 1128.0).
   - **Velocity**: 4.0818 m/s, accelerating at 2.7219 m/s².
   - **Relative Motion**: Approaching ego from the side with a closing lateral distance. The trajectory suggests a potential intersection with ego's path.
   - **TTC**: Estimated to be low due to high relative velocity and closing distance.
   - **Risk**: **High Risk (2)** - Urgent action needed to avoid collision.

2. **Obstacle 3265**:
   - **Position**: (-354.609, -4.9332) at 5.1s, moving away from ego's lane (lanelet 223.0).
   - **Velocity**: 10.1423 m/s, accelerating at 1.4127 m/s².
   - **Relative Motion**: Moving away from ego, but high speed and acceleration could pose a risk if trajectory changes.
   - **TTC**: High, as it is moving away.
   - **Risk**: **Medium Risk (3)** - Manageable with system response.

3. **Obstacle 3256**:
   - **Position**: (-371.4882, 24.8545) at 5.1s, moving slowly (0.1999 m/s) in lanelet 875.0.
   - **Relative Motion**: Minimal movement, but lateral distance is significant.
   - **TTC**: High, as it is not approaching ego.
   - **Risk**: **Low Risk (4)** - No immediate danger.

4. **Obstacle 3263**:
   - **Position**: (-357.4847, 1.8047) at 5.1s, stationary.
   - **Relative Motion**: No movement, but close to ego's path.
   - **TTC**: Infinite, as it is stationary.
   - **Risk**: **Low Risk (4)** - No immediate danger.
