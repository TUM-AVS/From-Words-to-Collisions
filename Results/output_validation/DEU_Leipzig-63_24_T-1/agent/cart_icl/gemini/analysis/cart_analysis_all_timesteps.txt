Obstacle 3265 shows the highest risk. It is approaching the ego vehicle at high speed (increasing from 8.3404 m/s to 10.1423 m/s) and is closing the distance rapidly. Its y-coordinate transitions from 0.1341 to -4.9332, indicating movement towards the ego vehicle's y-coordinate (around 2.7). While more information about the vehicles' sizes and precise trajectories is needed for a definitive TTC calculation, the rapid approach and high speed suggest a very high risk of collision.

Obstacle 3261 is also moving towards the ego vehicle, though not as rapidly as 3265. It shows increasing speed and is changing its orientation. Further observation is needed, but the risk is currently medium.

Other obstacles remain stationary or do not pose an immediate threat due to their distance and relative velocities.
