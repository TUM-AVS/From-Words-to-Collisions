Let's analyze the motion of the ego vehicle and surrounding obstacles over the given time steps, focusing on the latest one at 5.1 seconds.

### Key Considerations:

- **Ego Vehicle**: At 5.1 seconds, the ego vehicle is moving very slowly with a velocity of 0.0325 m/s and is under deceleration. It's situated in lanelet 2738.0.

#### Obstacle Analysis at 5.1 seconds:

1. **Obstacle 3253.0**:
   - Stationary at position (-375.7721, 12.8873).
   - Distance from ego is approximately 10.2 meters (lateral distance mainly contributes to this).
   - **Low Risk**: Obstacle is stationary and far from the ego's longitudinal path.

2. **Obstacle 3255.0**:
   - Stationary at position (-390.3855, 23.8008).
   - The obstacle is about 25 meters from the ego.
   - **Negligible Risk**: Too far to pose any immediate threat.

3. **Obstacle 3256.0**:
   - Position is (-371.4882, 24.8545) with a very slow speed of 0.1999 m/s.
   - Approximately 19.5 meters away laterally, moving parallel but also far from ego's path.
   - **Negligible Risk**: Low speed and significant lateral distance.

4. **Obstacle 3261.0**:
   - Position is (-377.264, -1.3499) with speed 4.0818 m/s, accelerating.
   - Relative position indicates it's ahead and off track with ego; lateral distance increases due to different lane paths.
   - **Low Risk**: Despite being the fast moving ahead obstacle, the increased lateral offset reduces risk.

5. **Obstacle 3263.0**:
   - Stationary at (-357.4847, 1.8047).
   - Far from ego's path both longitudinally and laterally.
   - **Negligible Risk**: No movement, far from ego.

6. **Obstacle 3265.0**:
   - At (-354.609, -4.9332) travelling fast at 10.1423 m/s.
   - Fast moving but positioned in a lane on the opposite trajectory of the ego.
   - **Medium Risk**: Increased speed and opposite direction of travel; primarily observed for sudden lane changes.

### Risk Evaluation Summary

None of the vehicles are on an immediate collision course with the ego vehicle. The motions suggest limited cross-path conflicts, predominantly due to lateral offsets and egoâ€™s deceleration. Therefore, no obstacles are categorized as collision imminent or extreme risk obstacles at this moment.

Given the above evaluations, the JSON output is:

    "CollisionObstacles": [],
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {},
    "HighRiskObstacle": {}
