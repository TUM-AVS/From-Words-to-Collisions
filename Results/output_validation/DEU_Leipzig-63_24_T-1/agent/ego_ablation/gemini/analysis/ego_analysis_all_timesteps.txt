At t=5.1s, Obstacle 3261 is behind the ego vehicle at -0.82m longitudinally, posing a potential collision risk. All other obstacles are at safe distances, laterally and longitudinally, but their trajectories should be continuously monitored.

Obstacle 3253, 3255, and 3263 are longitudinally close but laterally separated and moving slowly relative to the ego vehicle. Obstacle 3256 is further away with no immediate risk. Obstacle 3265 is moving away laterally to the right of the ego vehicle and presents no risk. Obstacle 3261, however, is very close behind the ego vehicle longitudinally and moving toward it, indicating a high risk of collision.
