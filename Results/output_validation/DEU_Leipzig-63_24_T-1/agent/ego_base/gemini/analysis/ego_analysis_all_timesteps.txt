At timestamp 5.1 seconds, Obstacle 3261 is rapidly approaching the ego vehicle from behind with a longitudinal distance of -0.82 meters and a relative longitudinal velocity of 3.96 m/s.  Given its proximity and high closing speed, a collision is imminent. Obstacle 3261 poses an extreme risk.

Obstacle 3253 is in the front-left of the ego vehicle, maintaining a steady longitudinal distance of approximately 2.93 meters and a very low longitudinal velocity, posing negligible risk. 

Obstacle 3255 is far away laterally (23.73m) and slowly approaching longitudinally, posing no immediate risk. 

Obstacle 3256 is located at a safe longitudinal distance and slowly approaching, posing a negligible risk. 

Obstacle 3263 is in the front-right and not moving relatively towards the ego vehicle, thus posing no immediate threat. 

Obstacle 3265 is moving away laterally and not approaching longitudinally, posing no immediate risk.

Risk Levels:
0: Collision - Physical contact occurred or unavoidable
1: Extreme Risk - Immediate collision likely
2: High Risk - Close to collision, needs quick action
3: Medium Risk - Manageable with proper reaction
4: Low Risk - Minimal risk, sufficient time to react
5: Negligible Risk - No significant risk
