### Safety analysis for timestep 5.1s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

**Assumptions and Clarifications:**

* **Missing Vehicle Dimensions:**  The provided context lacks ego vehicle and obstacle dimensions.  Accurate MDC calculations are impossible without these. I'll proceed with the analysis using the provided distances as *approximations* of MDC, but the results will have reduced accuracy.  Accurate collision prediction REQUIRES vehicle dimensions.
* **Lateral Movement Handling:** While lateral *distances* are provided, a clear methodology for calculating lateral TTC (TTClat) is not defined in the prompt. I will focus primarily on longitudinal TTC (TTClong) for risk assessment.
* **"Adjusted Distance" Ambiguity:** The prompt mentions "adjusted distances" but doesn't provide them. I will use the given 'real distances'. This needs correction for a proper analysis.
* **Collision Definition:** I'm defining collision as an overlap in the occupied space of the ego vehicle and an obstacle.

### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 3253**
    - Distance Risk reason:  Located front-left at ~2.93m longitudinal and ~2.93m lateral distance.  Represents a potential collision risk given the limited distance, especially without accounting for vehicle dimensions.
    - Distance safety score: 3 (Medium Risk)
    - Time Risk reason:  Slow closing velocity (-0.03 m/s) but still moving closer.  Without accurate dimensions and a more precise TTC calculation, a moderate risk is assigned.
    - Time safety score: 3 (Medium Risk)
    - Overall Risk score: 3
- **Obstacle ID: 3255**
    - Distance Risk reason: Located front-left at ~4.18m longitudinal and ~4.18m lateral distance. Lower risk compared to 3253 due to greater distance.
    - Distance safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
    - Time Risk reason:  Slow closing velocity (-0.03 m/s). The risk is considered low due to the distance and slow closing speed.
    - Time safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
    - Overall Risk score: 4
- **Obstacle ID: 3256**
    - Distance Risk reason: Located far front-left (~15.31m longitudinal and ~15.31m lateral).  Poses no immediate risk.
    - Distance safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
    - Time Risk reason: Moving slowly towards the ego vehicle longitudinally (-0.23 m/s).  However, given the large distance, the risk is negligible.
    - Time safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
    - Overall Risk score: 5
- **Obstacle ID: 3261**
    - Distance Risk reason: Located close behind (-0.82m longitudinal, -0.82m lateral). High risk due to proximity.
    - Distance safety score: 2 (High Risk)
    - Time Risk reason:  Rapidly approaching (3.96 m/s). High risk of rear-end collision.
    - Time safety score: 1 (Extreme Risk)
    - Overall Risk score: 1
- **Obstacle ID: 3263**
    - Distance Risk reason: Located front-right (~3.53m longitudinal and lateral). Moderate risk due to the distance.
    - Distance safety score: 3 (Medium Risk)
    - Time Risk reason:  Moving very slowly toward the ego vehicle (-0.03 m/s).  Presents a low risk given the current distance and slow closing speed.
    - Time safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
    - Overall Risk score: 3
- **Obstacle ID: 3265**
    - Distance Risk reason: Located at 0m longitudinal and 0m lateral distance to the right.  This implies a current collision or an extremely high risk of immediate collision.
    - Distance safety score: 0 (Collision)
    - Time Risk reason: Although moving laterally right at -10.13m/s, the 0m longitudinal separation poses a significant collision risk with its velocity of -0.58m/s.
    - Time safety score: 0 (Collision)
    - Overall Risk score: 0
