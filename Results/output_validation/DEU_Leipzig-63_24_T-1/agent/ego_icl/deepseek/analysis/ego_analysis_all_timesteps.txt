Let me analyze each obstacle at the most recent timestep (5.1 seconds) with trajectory context from previous timesteps:

1. Obstacle 3253 (Front-left):
   - Adjusted distances: longitudinal 2.93m, lateral 5.53m
   - Velocities: longitudinal -0.03m/s (very slow approach), lateral 0.00m/s
   - MDC: Lateral distance is large (5.53m), longitudinal distance stable
   - TTC: Not applicable (very slow approach)
   - Risk: 5 (Negligible)

2. Obstacle 3255 (Front-left):
   - Adjusted distances: longitudinal 4.18m, lateral 23.73m
   - Velocities: longitudinal -0.03m/s, lateral 0.00m/s
   - MDC: Very large distances in both dimensions
   - TTC: Not applicable
   - Risk: 5 (Negligible)

3. Obstacle 3256 (Front-left):
   - Adjusted distances: longitudinal 15.31m, lateral 8.42m
   - Velocities: longitudinal -0.23m/s (slow approach), lateral 0.00m/s
   - MDC: Large distances in both dimensions
   - TTC: longitudinal ~66.5s (very long)
   - Risk: 5 (Negligible)

4. Obstacle 3261 (Behind):
   - Adjusted distances: longitudinal -0.82m (approaching from behind), lateral 0.00m
   - Velocities: longitudinal 3.96m/s (rapid approach), lateral -0.83m/s
   - MDC: Lateral distance 0m (same lane), longitudinal distance closing rapidly
   - TTC: longitudinal 0.21s (extreme risk)
   - Risk: 1 (Extreme Risk) - This is the most critical obstacle

5. Obstacle 3263 (Front-right):
   - Adjusted distances: longitudinal 3.53m, lateral -12.62m
   - Velocities: longitudinal -0.03m/s, lateral 0.00m/s
   - MDC: Large distances in both dimensions
   - TTC: Not applicable
   - Risk: 5 (Negligible)

6. Obstacle 3265 (Right):
   - Adjusted distances: longitudinal 0.00m, lateral -18.69m
   - Velocities: longitudinal -0.58m/s, lateral -10.13m/s (moving rapidly away)
   - MDC: Large and increasing lateral distance
   - TTC: Not applicable (moving away)
   - Risk: 5 (Negligible)

Trajectory Analysis:
- Obstacle 3261 shows consistent rapid approach from behind (longitudinal distance decreasing from -3.64m to -0.82m in 1 second)
- All other obstacles either maintain safe distances or are moving away
- Obstacle 3261 is laterally aligned (0.00m) and closing at 3.96m/s - extreme risk of rear-end collision
