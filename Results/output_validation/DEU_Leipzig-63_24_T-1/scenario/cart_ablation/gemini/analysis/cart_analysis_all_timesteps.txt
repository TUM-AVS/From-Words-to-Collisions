At t=5.3s, the ego vehicle at (-373.7998, 2.7688) is moving slowly with a velocity of 0.027 and decelerating at -0.015.  Let's analyze the obstacles:

* **Obstacle 3253:** Stationary at (-375.7721, 12.8873).  No immediate risk due to lateral separation. Risk Score: 5
* **Obstacle 3255:** Stationary at (-390.3855, 23.8008).  No immediate risk due to distance. Risk Score: 5
* **Obstacle 3256:** At (-371.4706, 24.8241), moving with velocity 0.3999.  While somewhat close longitudinally, the lateral separation suggests no immediate collision risk. Risk Score: 4
* **Obstacle 3261:** At (-376.6579, -0.7098), moving with velocity 4.6262.  This obstacle is approaching the ego vehicle's y-coordinate rapidly and from behind. The x values are also converging and given the speed differential there is a high risk of collision in the near future. Risk Score: 2
* **Obstacle 3263:** Stationary at (-357.4847, 1.8047). Some longitudinal risk. Given the ego vehicle's low speed and the stationary nature of the obstacle, ample time to react. Risk Score: 3
* **Obstacle 3265:** At (-352.8994, -6.1103), moving with velocity 10.5418. Although this obstacle has a high velocity, its trajectory suggests it is moving away from the ego vehicle.  Risk Score: 5

None of the obstacles present a collision or extreme risk scenario in the most recent provided timestep (5.3s).
