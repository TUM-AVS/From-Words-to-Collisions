### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. **Ego Vehicle**: Moving slowly (~0.027 m/s) with minimal acceleration.  
2. **Closest Obstacle**: 3261.0 (TTC ~4s, Medium Risk).  
3. **No Collision**: All obstacles are either static, moving away, or have diverging trajectories.  
4. **Highest Risk**: 3261.0 (Overall Score 3) â€“ requires monitoring but no immediate threat.
