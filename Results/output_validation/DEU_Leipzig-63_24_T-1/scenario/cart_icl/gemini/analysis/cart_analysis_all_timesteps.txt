### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 3253.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is laterally distant from ego and poses no immediate threat.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Obstacle is stationary.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 3255.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is laterally and longitudinally distant from ego.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Obstacle is stationary.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 3256.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is laterally distant and longitudinally approaching ego but slowing down significantly.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason:  Obstacle's deceleration suggests reduced risk over time.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- Obstacle ID: 3261.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is behind and laterally offset from ego, but moving faster.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Obstacle's higher speed requires monitoring but no immediate collision risk.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- Obstacle ID: 3263.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is longitudinally ahead and laterally distant from ego.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Obstacle is stationary.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 3265.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is behind ego and moving much faster.  Lateral offset is small and shrinking.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: Obstacle's high speed and acceleration present potential future risk.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3


### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
No obstacles are on a direct collision course with the ego vehicle.  Obstacle 3265 is moving quickly and requires monitoring, but its current trajectory does not indicate an immediate collision risk. No collision is predicted based on the current data.
