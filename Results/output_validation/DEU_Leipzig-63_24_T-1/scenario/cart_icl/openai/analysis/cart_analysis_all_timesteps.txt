### Obstacle Analysis

**Obstacle ID: 3253.0**
- **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is stationary and located in a different lanelet than the ego vehicle, showing no movement over time.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: With zero velocity and acceleration, this obstacle poses no immediate collision threat.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

**Obstacle ID: 3255.0**
- **Distance Risk reason**: Stationary distant object in a separate lanelet; no change in position.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: Remained static throughout the timeline; no velocity, no risk.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

**Obstacle ID: 3256.0**
- **Distance Risk reason**: On a divergent trajectory with decreasing velocity in a different lanelet; it moves away from the ego vehicle.
- **Distance safety score**: 4
- **Time Risk reason**: The deceleration indicates lowering interaction potential.
- **Time safety score**: 4
- **Overall Risk score**: 4

**Obstacle ID: 3261.0**
- **Distance Risk reason**: Situated behind the ego vehicle’s path. Increase in speed, but not in the immediate ego vehicle direction.
- **Distance safety score**: 3
- **Time Risk reason**: Positive acceleration, but on a path diverging from that of the ego vehicle significantly in lateral terms.
- **Time safety score**: 3
- **Overall Risk score**: 3

**Obstacle ID: 3263.0**
- **Distance Risk reason**: Stationary and consistent in position; no threats observed.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: Completely stagnant over time.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

**Obstacle ID: 3265.0**
- **Distance Risk reason**: Rapidly moving with the trend of increasing velocity, but with a significant lateral offset away from the ego vehicle's path.
- **Distance safety score**: 4
- **Time Risk reason**: Velocity increase highlights potential for interaction if paths were to cross, but the trajectory is continuing away.
- **Time safety score**: 3
- **Overall Risk score**: 3

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
- From the data, there are no immediate threats of collision concerning the ego vehicle. Despite the high velocity of obstacle 3265.0, it moves away laterally and doesn’t directly interfere with the ego path. No obstacles make imminent contact; hence the collision scenario is unlikely based on the most recent and historical movements.
