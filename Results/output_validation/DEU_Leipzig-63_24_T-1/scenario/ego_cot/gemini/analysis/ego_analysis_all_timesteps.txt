### Safety analysis for timestep 4.4s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 3253
- Distance Risk reason:  Close proximity in front-left (2.94m longitudinal and lateral).
- Distance safety score: 2
- Time Risk reason:  Slow relative longitudinal velocity (-0.06 m/s) but closing.  No lateral movement.
- Time safety score: 2
- Overall Risk score: 2

- Obstacle ID: 3255
- Distance Risk reason:  Close proximity in front-left (4.10m longitudinal and lateral).
- Distance safety score: 2
- Time Risk reason: Slow relative longitudinal velocity (-0.06 m/s) but closing. No lateral movement.
- Time safety score: 2
- Overall Risk score: 2

- Obstacle ID: 3256
- Distance Risk reason:  Safe distance in front-left (15.48m longitudinal and lateral).
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason:  Closing longitudinally (-1.52 m/s) but significant lateral movement away. Acceleration suggests it might be braking.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- Obstacle ID: 3261
- Distance Risk reason: Close proximity behind (3.12m longitudinal and lateral).
- Distance safety score: 2
- Time Risk reason:  Rapidly closing from behind (2.67 m/s). Lateral motion unclear.
- Time safety score: 1
- Overall Risk score: 1

- Obstacle ID: 3263
- Distance Risk reason: Close proximity in front-right (3.63m longitudinal and lateral).
- Distance safety score: 2
- Time Risk reason:  Slow relative longitudinal velocity (-0.06 m/s) but closing. No lateral movement.
- Time safety score: 2
- Overall Risk score: 2

- Obstacle ID: 3265
- Distance Risk reason: Extremely close in front-right (0.02m longitudinal and lateral), almost touching.
- Distance safety score: 1
- Time Risk reason: Closing longitudinally (-0.77 m/s) and significant lateral velocity suggests possible collision despite moving to the right.
- Time safety score: 1
- Overall Risk score: 1



### Safety analysis for timestep 4.5s through 5.2s:

*Obstacles 3253, 3255, 3263 maintain a similar risk profile (Overall risk score 2) throughout these timesteps.* They are consistently close, but slow-moving relative to the ego vehicle with little to no lateral movement.

*Obstacle 3256 generally poses a low risk (Overall risk score 4).*  It maintains a safe distance and lateral movement mitigates some longitudinal closing.

*Obstacle 3261 exhibits increasing risk and ultimately collides at 5.3s.* It gets progressively closer to the ego vehicle from behind with a high closing velocity and uncertain lateral movement.

*Obstacle 3265 remains very close, but due to significant lateral velocity, collision becomes less likely (Overall risk score 1 turning to 4 after 4.6s).*

### Safety analysis for timestep 5.3s: 
Collision with obstacle 3261 occurs.

### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
  "CollisionObstacle": {
    "ObstacleID": "3261",
    "OverallRiskScore": "0"
  },
  "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {
    "ObstacleID": "3265",
    "OverallRiskScore": "1"
  },
  "IsCollisionScenario": true,
  "Justification": "Obstacle 3261 collides with the ego vehicle at 5.3 seconds. Obstacle 3265 is extremely close before timestep 4.6s and then maintains a moderate distance, hence considered extreme risk."
}
