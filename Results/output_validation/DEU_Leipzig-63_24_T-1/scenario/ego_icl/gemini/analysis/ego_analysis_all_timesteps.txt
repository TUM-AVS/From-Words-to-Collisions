* **Obstacle 3253 (Front-Left):**  This obstacle maintains a safe lateral distance throughout the provided timeframe. Longitudinally, it is slowly approaching the ego vehicle but at a very low velocity.  At the last timestep, the longitudinal distance is 2.88m with a closing velocity of -0.03 m/s.  This translates to a TTC of 96 seconds (2.88 / 0.03), if the current velocity is maintained. The MDC is also greater than 3m. This suggests low risk.

* **Obstacle 3255 (Front-Left):**  This obstacle is far to the left and poses no immediate threat.  Its longitudinal motion is similar to Obstacle 3253, slowly closing in but at a very low velocity and far distance. The risk is low.

* **Obstacle 3256 (Front-Left):**  This obstacle is at a relatively safe distance both longitudinally and laterally. It shows some longitudinal closing velocity initially but slows down.  The risk is medium.

* **Obstacle 3261 (Behind):** This obstacle is the most concerning. It is approaching the ego vehicle from behind, with its longitudinal distance decreasing across all timesteps.  At the final timestamp, the longitudinal distance is 0.00m and lateral distance is 0.00m indicating a collision has occurred. Since the relative longitudinal velocity is positive (4.53 m/s), obstacle 3261 is moving toward the ego vehicle longitudinally.  This, combined with the zero distances in both dimensions, confirms a collision at this timestamp.

* **Obstacle 3263 (Front-Right):**  This obstacle is to the right and maintains a safe lateral distance. The longitudinal distance is somewhat close, but the slow closing velocity suggests low risk.

* **Obstacle 3265 (Right):** This obstacle maintains a safe lateral distance and does not pose a risk.


**Collision Scenario Determination:**

Yes, this is a collision scenario. Obstacle 3261 shows a collision with the ego vehicle at the 5.3-second mark.
