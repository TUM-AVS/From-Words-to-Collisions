- Obstacle ID: 3261
- Relative Direction: Behind
- Distance Risk Reason: DTClong is 0m meaning a collision has occurred. DTClat is 0m. This obstacle has been approaching from behind over several timesteps and the longitudinal distance has been decreasing, leading to the collision.
- Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 0
- Lateral Distance Safety Score: 0
- Overall Distance Safety Score: 0
- Time Risk Reason: TTClong and TTClat are both 0, confirming the collision. Previous timesteps showed a decreasing TTClong.
- Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 0
- Lateral Time Safety Score: 0
- Overall Time Safety Score: 0
- Overall Risk Score: 0

- Obstacle ID: 3263
- Relative Direction: Front-right
- Distance Risk Reason: DTClong is 3.61m indicating a low risk. DTClat is -12.57m indicating negligible lateral risk. Risk levels have remained consistent.
- Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 4
- Lateral Distance Safety Score: 5
- Overall Distance Safety Score: 4.5
- Time Risk Reason: TTClong is 133.83s, indicating negligible risk longitudinally. TTClat is inf, also indicating negligible risk. The TTC has been increasing over time.
- Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 5
- Lateral Time Safety Score: 5
- Overall Time Safety Score: 5
- Overall Risk Score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 3265
- Relative Direction: Right
- Distance Risk Reason: DTClong is 0m. DTClat is -20.74m indicating negligible risk.  The obstacle has been moving laterally away from the ego vehicle, minimizing lateral risk.
- Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 0
- Lateral Distance Safety Score: 5
- Overall Distance Safety Score: 5.0
- Time Risk Reason: TTClong is 0s. TTClat is inf. While lateral motion is safe, longitudinal alignment indicates collision.
- Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 0
- Lateral Time Safety Score: 5
- Overall Time Safety Score: 5
- Overall Risk Score: 3
