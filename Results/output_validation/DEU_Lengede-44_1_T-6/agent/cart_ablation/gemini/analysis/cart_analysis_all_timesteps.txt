Here's the collision risk analysis:

**Obstacle 41:** This obstacle starts in a different lane (523) than the ego vehicle (522). While its trajectory shows movement towards the ego vehicle's lane, the provided data snapshots suggest it's still some distance away at the most recent timestep (6.7 seconds). Initially the distance between ego and obstacle 41 is large, and the trajectories don't intersect, indicating a low risk of immediate collision. Further calculations and more granular data may reveal medium risk of collision between 6.5s and 6.7s. More data points are needed to definitively classify the risk. For now, we classify it as a medium risk.

**Obstacle 109:** This obstacle is in the same lane (522) as the ego vehicle and behind it.  The data shows that Obstacle 109 is moving slightly slower than the ego vehicle. Based on the provided positions and velocities, there's no immediate danger of collision. We assess the risk as negligible (5).

**Obstacle 45:** This obstacle appears in the data at 6.6s. Considering the limited information available, we cannot determine its past trajectory or predict its future behavior. As a result, it's not possible to assign a risk score currently with confidence. However, considering that it starts relatively far away from the ego vehicle, we evaluate the risk as negligible (5) for the current time step.

**Predicted Extreme Risk Obstacle**: Obstacle 41 demonstrates an increasing risk over the last three timestamps, particularly between 6.5s and 6.7s, when its lateral movement becomes more significant. Due to the limited information, we cannot calculate the intersection points with full accuracy. However, extrapolating the current trajectories suggest it becomes high risk within a second or two from the final data point (6.7s). Therefore, obstacle 41 is flagged as a predicted extreme risk.
