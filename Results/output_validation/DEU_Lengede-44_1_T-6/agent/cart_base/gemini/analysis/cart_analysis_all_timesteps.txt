Obstacle 41: This obstacle is in a different lanelet (523) than the ego vehicle (522). Initially, it poses no risk. However, its trajectory shows it moving closer to the ego vehicle's lanelet and its x-position decreases significantly between t=6.5s and t=6.7s, suggesting a lane change or turn. While a collision isn't imminent in the given timeframe, the rapid x-position change raises concern. This obstacle needs close monitoring, warranting a risk score of 2 (High Risk) due to potential lane change conflict.

Obstacle 109: This obstacle is in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle (522). It is behind the ego vehicle and maintains a safe following distance. Although its velocity fluctuates slightly, it doesn't exhibit any erratic behavior. Its trajectory suggests no immediate collision risk. Therefore, a risk score of 4 (Low Risk) is assigned.

Obstacle 45: This obstacle appears at t=6.6s in lanelet 523 and is relatively far from the ego vehicle. Within the given timeframe, it doesn't present an immediate risk. It warrants a risk score of 4 (Low Risk).
