Obstacle 41 is moving towards the ego vehicle and is now very close laterally, but its longitudinal velocity suggests it will continue to cross the ego vehicle's path.  Obstacle 45 is also approaching but does not appear as immediately risky as 41 based on current positions and velocities. Obstacle 109 is in the same lane as the ego vehicle and slightly behind, posing low risk due to larger longitudinal separation and similar velocities.
