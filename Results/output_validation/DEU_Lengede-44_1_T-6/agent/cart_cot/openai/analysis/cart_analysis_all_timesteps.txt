### Analysis

At the most recent timestep (6.7 seconds), we evaluate the position and motion of the Ego vehicle and the surrounding obstacles:

1. **Ego Vehicle (99.0)**
   - Position: (85.0036, -230.6013)
   - Velocity: 8.6405
   - Trajectory indicates consistent forward progress.

2. **Obstacle 41.0**
   - Position: (75.2602, -239.6927)
   - Velocity: 34.4845
   - This obstacle is moving fast with a potentially intersecting path with the Ego, as it is still in an adjacent lanelet but getting closer over time.
   - Reduced distance over time indicates a significant approach to the Ego vehicle. However, given the current position disparity, this proximity does not warrant a score of 0 or 1 but likely deserves monitoring.

3. **Obstacle 45.0**
   - Position: (92.9768, -208.1005)
   - Velocity: 33.0506
   - This obstacle is far from the path of the Ego, reducing its immediate collision risk significantly.

4. **Obstacle 109.0**
   - Position: (81.9903, -234.7126)
   - Velocity: 10.6576
   - Within the same lanelet as the Ego and is very close in position.
   - Given the position and relative velocity, this is the most alarming, showing a decreasing MDC and nearing the Ego's location with potential for a collision.

### Conclusion

- **Obstacle 109.0** is deemed the highest risk given its collision trajectory and proximity. It merits an **Overall Risk Score of 1** due to its trajectory and potential to intersect with the Ego vehicle swiftly if corrective actions are not taken.
