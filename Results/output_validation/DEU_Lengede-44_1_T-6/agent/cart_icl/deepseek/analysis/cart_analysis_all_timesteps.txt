### Analysis:

1. **Obstacle 41.0**:
   - **Position**: (75.2602, -239.6927) at 6.7s, moving towards ego's lanelet (523.0 -> 522.0).
   - **Velocity**: 34.4845 m/s (high speed, approaching ego).
   - **Relative Motion**: The obstacle is moving from the front-left towards ego's path. The lateral distance is decreasing, and the TTC is low due to high relative speed.
   - **Risk**: **Extreme Risk (1)** - Collision likely and imminent due to high speed and closing distance.

2. **Obstacle 109.0**:
   - **Position**: (81.9903, -234.7126) at 6.7s, same lanelet as ego (522.0).
   - **Velocity**: 10.6576 m/s (similar to ego's speed).
   - **Relative Motion**: The obstacle is ahead of ego but moving at a similar speed. The distance is stable, and TTC is high.
   - **Risk**: **Low Risk (4)** - No immediate danger.

3. **Obstacle 45.0**:
   - **Position**: (92.9768, -208.1005) at 6.7s, in lanelet 523.0.
   - **Velocity**: 33.0506 m/s (high speed, but lateral distance is significant).
   - **Relative Motion**: The obstacle is far ahead and to the left, not directly in ego's path.
   - **Risk**: **Negligible Risk (5)** - No meaningful risk.
