At timestep 6.7s, obstacle 41 is moving towards the ego vehicle's lanelet, but it appears to be changing lanes and not directly toward the ego vehicle. More data is needed to fully ascertain the future trajectory of obstacle 41. Obstacle 109 is in the same lane as the ego vehicle and moving slightly slower. It is not currently a high risk, but its motion should be monitored. Obstacle 45 is far from the ego vehicle and poses no immediate threat.
