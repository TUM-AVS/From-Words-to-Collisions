At the most recent timestep (6.7 seconds), the following analysis applies:

* **Obstacle 41 (Rear-left):** This obstacle is moving away longitudinally and slightly toward the ego car laterally.  Given the distances (-8.21m longitudinal, 2.37m lateral), both TTC and MDC suggest negligible risk. Overall risk score: 5.

* **Obstacle 45 (Front-left):** This obstacle is approaching the ego vehicle longitudinally and laterally. The longitudinal distance is 18.99m.  At a relative velocity of -41.69 m/s, the TTC is approximately 0.45 seconds, making this an **extreme risk**. The lateral distance is 2.58m, making MDC high. Overall risk score: 1.

* **Obstacle 109 (Behind):** This obstacle is very close behind the ego vehicle (-0.56m longitudinal) and almost exactly aligned laterally (0.00m). With the relative longitudinal velocity of 2.02 m/s, collision is imminent.  Overall risk score: 0.
