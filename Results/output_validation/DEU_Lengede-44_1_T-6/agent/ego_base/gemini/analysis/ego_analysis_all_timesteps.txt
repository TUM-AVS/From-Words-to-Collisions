At the most recent timestep (6.7 seconds):

* **Obstacle 41 (Rear-left):**  This obstacle is moving away longitudinally, posing no immediate longitudinal risk.  It is slightly behind and to the left of the ego vehicle. While laterally approaching, the relative lateral velocity is low (-0.06 m/s). This obstacle is low risk.

* **Obstacle 45 (Front-left):** This obstacle is approaching the ego vehicle longitudinally at a high relative velocity (-41.69 m/s) and is also moving laterally closer. The longitudinal distance of 18.99 m suggests this is a potential hazard depending on the ego vehicle's speed, but not an immediate collision. This obstacle is a high risk.

* **Obstacle 109 (Behind):** This obstacle is approaching from behind at a low relative velocity (2.02 m/s) and is very close longitudinally (-0.56m). This close proximity combined with the continued longitudinal approach means a collision is likely if the ego vehicle were to brake suddenly or reverse. This obstacle is an extreme risk.

Risk Levels:
0: Collision - Physical contact occurred or unavoidable
1: Extreme Risk - Immediate collision likely
2: High Risk - Close to collision, needs quick action
3: Medium Risk - Manageable with proper reaction
4: Low Risk - Minimal risk, sufficient time to react
5: Negligible Risk - No significant risk
