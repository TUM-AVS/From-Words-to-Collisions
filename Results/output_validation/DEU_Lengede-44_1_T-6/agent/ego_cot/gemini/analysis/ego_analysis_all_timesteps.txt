### Safety analysis for timestep 6.7s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

**Calculations and Assumptions:**

* **Adjusted Distance:**  Since no vehicle sizes are provided, I'll assume a generic car length of 4 meters and width of 2 meters.  I will adjust the longitudinal and lateral distances by subtracting half the ego vehicle's length and width, respectively, from the absolute values of the provided distances.  This adjustment provides a more realistic safety margin. For obstacles behind the ego vehicle, the adjustments will be added.
* **TTC:** I'll calculate TTC using the adjusted longitudinal and lateral distances divided by their respective relative velocities.  A negative TTC implies the obstacle is moving away.
* **MDC:**  MDC will be calculated as the minimum adjusted distance over the predicted trajectory (next 0.1-second interval based on available data) for each obstacle.


**Obstacle Analysis:**

- **Obstacle ID: 41**
    - Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 41 is moving away from the ego vehicle both longitudinally (-8.21m adjusted to approximately -4.21m after considering ego length) and laterally (-8.21m adjusted to approximately -7.21m after considering ego width). It poses no immediate proximity risk.
    - Distance safety score: 5
    - Time Risk reason: Negative TTC in both longitudinal and lateral directions indicates the obstacle is moving away.
    - Time safety score: 5
    - Overall Risk score: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 45**
    - Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 45 is 18.99m longitudinally (adjusted to ~16.99m) and 18.99m laterally (adjusted to ~17.99m) from the ego vehicle. While it's approaching, the distance is significant.
    - Distance safety score: 5
    - Time Risk reason:  TTC needs to be calculated based on the relative velocity. Assuming a constant velocity, TTC is greater than 5 seconds in both directions.
    - Time safety score: 5
    - Overall Risk score: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 109**
    - Distance Risk reason:  Obstacle 109 is very close behind the ego vehicle at -0.56m longitudinally (adjusted to approximately 1.44m after considering ego length) and -0.56m laterally (adjusted to approximately 0.44 after considering ego width). This presents a high risk of collision.
    - Distance safety score: 2
    - Time Risk reason:  The closing velocity suggests a very short time to collision if the trajectories remain unchanged. Assuming constant velocity, TTC will be less than 1 second.
    - Time safety score: 2
    - Overall Risk score: 2
