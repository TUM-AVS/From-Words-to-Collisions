### Obstacle-by-Obstacle Analysis (Most Recent Timestep: 6.7 seconds)

#### **Obstacle 41 (Rear-left of ego car)**
- **Adjusted Distance**: Longitudinal -8.21 m, Lateral 2.37 m  
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal -43.12 m/s (moving away), Lateral -0.06 m/s (very slight approach)  
- **Motion Description**: Obstacle is moving away longitudinally. Obstacle is driving toward the ego car laterally from the left (but very slowly).  

**Risk Assessment**:  
- **Longitudinal**: The obstacle is moving away from the ego vehicle at high speed (-43.12 m/s). No collision risk longitudinally.  
- **Lateral**: The lateral distance is 2.37 m and closing very slowly (-0.06 m/s).  
  - **TTC (Lateral)**: 2.37 / 0.06 ≈ 39.5 seconds (Negligible Risk, 5)  
  - **MDC (Lateral)**: 2.37 m (Low Risk, 4)  
- **Overall Risk**: Low Risk (4)

#### **Obstacle 45 (Front-left of ego car)**
- **Adjusted Distance**: Longitudinal 18.99 m, Lateral 2.58 m  
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal -41.69 m/s (approaching rapidly), Lateral -0.32 m/s (approaching slowly)  
- **Motion Description**: Obstacle is driving toward the ego car longitudinally and laterally from the left.  

**Risk Assessment**:  
- **Longitudinal**:  
  - Distance = 18.99 m, Closing velocity = 41.69 m/s  
  - **TTC (Longitudinal)**: 18.99 / 41.69 ≈ 0.46 seconds (Extreme Risk, 1)  
  - **MDC (Longitudinal)**: 18.99 m (but closing rapidly, so focus on TTC)  
- **Lateral**:  
  - Distance = 2.58 m, Closing velocity = 0.32 m/s  
  - **TTC (Lateral)**: 2.58 / 0.32 ≈ 8.06 seconds (No Risk, 5)  
  - **MDC (Lateral)**: 2.58 m (Low Risk, 4)  
- **Overall Risk**: **Extreme Risk (1)** due to longitudinal TTC < 0.5s.

#### **Obstacle 109 (Behind of ego car)**
- **Adjusted Distance**: Longitudinal -0.56 m, Lateral 0.00 m  
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal 2.02 m/s (approaching), Lateral 0.18 m/s (very slight drift)  
- **Motion Description**: Obstacle is driving toward the ego car from behind. Exact lateral alignment.  

**Risk Assessment**:  
- **Longitudinal**:  
  - Distance = 0.56 m (behind), Closing velocity = 2.02 m/s  
  - **TTC (Longitudinal)**: 0.56 / 2.02 ≈ 0.28 seconds (Extreme Risk, 1)  
  - **MDC (Longitudinal)**: 0.56 m (Extreme Risk, 1)  
- **Lateral**:  
  - Distance = 0.00 m (aligned), Closing velocity = 0.18 m/s (negligible)  
  - No lateral collision risk unless longitudinal collision occurs.  
- **Overall Risk**: **Extreme Risk (1)** due to imminent rear collision.

### Trajectory Analysis
- **Obstacle 45**: Rapidly approaching from the front-left (TTC ≈ 0.46s). If not avoided, a collision is imminent.  
- **Obstacle 109**: Approaching from behind (TTC ≈ 0.28s). Likely to collide first unless evasive action is taken.  
- **Obstacle 41**: Moving away, minimal risk.

### Explanation:
- **Obstacle 109** is assigned **Collision Risk (0)** because it is extremely close (0.56 m behind) and closing rapidly (TTC ≈ 0.28s). A rear collision is imminent.  
- **Obstacle 45** is **Extreme Risk (1)** due to its high closing speed (TTC ≈ 0.46s). If not avoided, it will collide shortly after Obstacle 109.  
- **Obstacle 41** is not included in the summary as it poses minimal risk.  

### Immediate Action Required:
- **Emergency braking or acceleration** to avoid Obstacle 109 (rear collision).  
- **Lateral evasion** to mitigate risk from Obstacle 45 (front-left collision).
