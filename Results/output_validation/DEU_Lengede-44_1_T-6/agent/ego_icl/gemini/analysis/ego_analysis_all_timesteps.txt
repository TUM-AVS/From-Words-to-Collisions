Obstacle 41 (Rear-Left):
- Trajectory: This obstacle was initially front-left, then moved to the left of the ego vehicle, and is now rear-left.  The longitudinal distance has transitioned from positive to negative, indicating it has passed the ego vehicle. The lateral distance has remained relatively stable around 2-3 meters.
- Analysis at 6.7s:
    - Longitudinal distance: -8.21m (moving away)
    - Lateral distance: 2.37m 
    - Longitudinal velocity: -43.12 m/s (moving away)
    - Lateral velocity: -0.06 m/s (slightly moving away)
- Risk Assessment: Although the lateral distance is moderate, the obstacle is moving away longitudinally.  This poses a Negligible risk.

Obstacle 45 (Front-Left):
- Trajectory: This obstacle appears newly in the scene and is approaching the ego vehicle from the front-left.
- Analysis at 6.7s:
    - Longitudinal distance: 18.99m
    - Lateral distance: 2.58m
    - Longitudinal velocity: -41.69 m/s (approaching)
    - Lateral velocity: -0.32 m/s (slightly approaching)
- TTC: 18.99m / 41.69 m/s ≈ 0.45s (Extreme Risk)
- MDC: Considering the trajectory and velocities, the MDC will likely be around 2.5m in the near future. This corresponds to a Low/Medium risk but we prioritize the TTC which points to Extreme risk (1) due to fast closing velocity longitudinally.

Obstacle 109 (Behind):
- Trajectory: This obstacle has been consistently behind the ego vehicle and is approaching longitudinally. The lateral distance remains at 0.00m, indicating consistent alignment in the same lane.
- Analysis at 6.7s:
    - Longitudinal distance: -0.56m (very close)
    - Lateral distance: 0.00m (same lane)
    - Longitudinal velocity: 2.02 m/s (approaching)
    - Lateral velocity: 0.18 m/s (minimal lateral movement)
- TTC: 0.56m / 2.02 m/s ≈ 0.28s (Extreme Risk)
- MDC: Given the exact lateral alignment and rapidly decreasing longitudinal distance, the MDC is extremely low (< 0.5m). This indicates an Extreme Risk (1).

Overall Assessment:

Obstacle 109 presents the most immediate danger due to its proximity, closing velocity, and exact lateral alignment behind the ego vehicle. While obstacle 45 is also approaching quickly, obstacle 109's position directly behind poses a significantly more critical and imminent collision risk.
