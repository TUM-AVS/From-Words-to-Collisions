At t=6.9s, Ego (ID 99) is at (85.8805, -229.1091) in lanelet 522. Obstacle 41 is at (72.7951, -246.0843) in lanelet 523, and Obstacle 109 is at (83.0067, -232.8745) also in lanelet 522. Obstacle 45 is at (89.7154, -213.9022).

Obstacle 41 is in a different lanelet and poses no immediate risk despite the decreasing y-coordinate values over time.

Obstacle 109 is in the same lanelet as Ego.  The x-positions are converging and the y-positions are close.  Obstacle 109's x-position at t=6.9s is behind Ego, but  the trajectories suggest a possible collision or near miss in the near future. This warrants a high risk assessment.

Obstacle 45 is in a different lanelet and poses no immediate risk.

Since no collision is imminent, but Obstacle 109 presents a serious and immediate risk, the scenario is classified as high risk.
