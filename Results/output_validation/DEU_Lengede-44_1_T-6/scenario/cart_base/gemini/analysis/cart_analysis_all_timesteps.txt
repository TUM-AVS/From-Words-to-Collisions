Obstacle 41 is in a different lane (523) than the ego vehicle (522), and its y-position is decreasing rapidly, indicating it's moving away from the ego vehicle.  Obstacle 45 is also in lane 523 and significantly further away than Obstacle 41. Obstacle 109 is in the same lane as the ego vehicle (522), but its y-position is higher (meaning further behind given the negative y-axis direction) and its velocity is lower than the ego vehicle's. Based on the current trajectories, no immediate collision is expected.
