### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 41.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 41.0 started in a different lanelet but its trajectory over the past several timesteps shows a clear movement towards the ego vehicle's lanelet.  At the most recent timestep, it is very close to the ego vehicle, presenting a high risk of collision.
- Distance safety score: 2
- Time Risk reason: While the obstacle is moving at a higher speed than the ego vehicle, its trajectory indicates a potential lane change or cut-in maneuver, making the time to collision potentially very short. This, combined with the closing distance, represents a significant risk.
- Time safety score: 2
- Overall Risk score: 2

- Obstacle ID: 45.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 45.0 is relatively far from the ego vehicle and in a different lanelet.  Its trajectory does not indicate an immediate movement towards the ego vehicle's lanelet.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Given the current distance and differing lanelets, the time to collision is relatively large.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 109.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 109.0 is in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle but maintains a safe following distance.  The historical data shows it has been consistently behind the ego vehicle.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: While in the same lane, the velocity difference is not large, and the obstacle's acceleration is not indicative of any sudden maneuvers.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4


### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. **Identify the most critical obstacles:** Obstacle 41.0 presents the most significant risk due to its trajectory moving towards the ego vehicle's lanelet and the rapidly decreasing distance between them.

2. **Analyze their trajectories over all 10 timesteps:** Obstacle 41.0 has consistently moved closer to the ego vehicle and is exhibiting a lane-changing behavior.  Obstacle 109.0 remains behind the ego vehicle at a relatively safe distance. Obstacle 45.0 is relatively far away and in a different lanelet.

3. **Evaluate relative positions, velocities, and accelerations:**  Obstacle 41.0's lateral movement towards the ego vehicle's lane, combined with its higher velocity, increases the risk of a near-term collision. Although obstacle 109.0 is in the same lane, its velocity and acceleration profiles don't suggest an imminent collision. Obstacle 45.0 does not pose an immediate threat due to distance and lane separation.

4. **Determine if any collision has occurred or is imminent:** No collision has occurred. However, a collision with Obstacle 41.0 is potentially imminent due to its lane-changing behavior and proximity to the ego vehicle.

5. **Explain your reasoning for your conclusion:** The combination of decreasing distance, lateral movement across lanelets, and relative velocities suggests a high probability of a near-term collision with Obstacle 41.0 if evasive action is not taken.

  "ScenarioAnalysis": {
    "IsCollisionScenario": false,
    "Reasoning": "Obstacle 41.0 poses a high risk due to its trajectory crossing into the ego vehicle's lane and rapidly decreasing distance. Although no collision has occurred yet, evasive maneuvers may be necessary to avoid a potential collision. No obstacles have a risk score of 0 indicating a definite collision."
