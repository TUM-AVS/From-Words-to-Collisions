### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep (6.9 seconds):

### Obstacle Analysis:
1. **Obstacle 4.0** (Same lanelet 522):
   - Distance: ~50m ahead, moving slowly (0.05 m/s)
   - TTC: Very high (low risk)
   - Overall Risk: 4 (Low Risk)

2. **Obstacle 14.0** (Same lanelet 522):
   - Distance: ~40m ahead, moving at 1.17 m/s
   - TTC: High (moderate risk)
   - Overall Risk: 3 (Medium Risk)

3. **Obstacle 41.0** (Adjacent lanelet 523):
   - High speed (34.57 m/s) but diverging trajectory
   - Distance: ~100m away
   - Overall Risk: 2 (High Risk due to speed)

4. **Obstacle 45.0** (Adjacent lanelet 523):
   - High speed (33.36 m/s) but diverging
   - Distance: ~80m away
   - Overall Risk: 2 (High Risk due to speed)

5. **Obstacle 61.0** (Adjacent lanelet 523):
   - High speed (31.99 m/s) but diverging
   - Distance: ~60m away
   - Overall Risk: 2 (High Risk)

6. **Obstacle 109.0** (Same lanelet 522):
   - Moving towards ego (10.43 m/s)
   - Distance: ~100m behind
   - TTC: ~9.6 seconds
   - Overall Risk: 2 (High Risk)

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. No immediate collisions detected in current timestep
2. Highest risks come from high-speed adjacent lane vehicles
3. Ego is maintaining safe distance from forward obstacles
4. Rear obstacle (109.0) requires monitoring but not imminent collision
