### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 41.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 41.0 is in a different lanelet and moving away from the ego vehicle.  The trajectories over the past several timesteps confirm this divergence.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason:  The relative velocities and trajectories indicate no risk of collision.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 45.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 45.0 is in a different lanelet and relatively far from the ego vehicle.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: The relative velocities and trajectories suggest no imminent collision risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 109.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 109.0 is in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle, but somewhat behind.  The distance has been consistently safe over the past few timesteps.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: The relative velocities show obstacle 109.0 is slightly slower than the ego vehicle, maintaining a safe following distance.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4


### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
No obstacles present an immediate collision risk. Obstacle 109.0 requires monitoring as it's in the same lane, but currently maintains a safe following distance.  This is not a collision scenario.
