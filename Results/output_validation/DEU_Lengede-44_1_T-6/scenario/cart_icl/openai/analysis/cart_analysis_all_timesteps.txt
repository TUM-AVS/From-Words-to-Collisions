### Obstacle Analysis:

#### Obstacle ID: 41
- **Distance Risk reason**: Obstacle 41 is moving in a separate lanelet (523) and has been moving consistently away from Ego's path, as demonstrated by its trajectory. The obstacle's position at the latest timestep greatly deviates from the positional track of the Ego vehicle.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: The relative velocity remains high with both positive overall velocity and horizontal spacing increasing with time. The obstacle shows no significant signs of entering or intersecting with the Ego's trajectory.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 45
- **Distance Risk reason**: This obstacle is located on lanelet 523, indicating it isn't in the same immediate driving path as the Ego vehicle. The distance has consistently remained significantly away from Ego's track.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: Obstacle 45 has a trajectory moving further away with a high velocity and a consistent increase in incremental positive positional change away from the Ego, suggesting decreasing risk.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 109
- **Distance Risk reason**: Obstacle 109 shares the same lanelet (522) and is consistently maintaining a trajectory toward the Egoâ€™s path. Over the timesteps, there's a narrowing position gap from Ego's position but hasn't yet reached imminent risk proximity.
- **Distance safety score**: 3
- **Time Risk reason**: Obstacle 109 has a relatively lower relative velocity and demonstrates deceleration trends, potentially reducing the future collision likelihood. However, the reduction in spacing raises medium concerns.
- **Time safety score**: 3
- **Overall Risk score**: 3

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
- The data from the most recent timestep and previous observations indicate no immediate collision scenario. Distances remain adequate, and velocity trends are either maintaining or reducing collision potential, especially for Obstacle 109, which poses the highest relative risk due to shared lanelet and proximity. However, neither distance nor relative velocity rates indicate inevitable collision.

        "Reasoning": "All obstacles are either in different lanes or maintained safe distances with non-intersecting trajectories. While Obstacle 109 was in the same lanelet, consistent relative spacing mitigates collision risk."
