Obstacle 41 is moving away longitudinally but laterally towards the ego vehicle, posing a low risk currently. Obstacle 45 is approaching the ego vehicle from the front-left, representing a medium risk due to its closing distance. Obstacle 109 is very close behind the ego vehicle and poses a high risk due to the minimal longitudinal distance.
