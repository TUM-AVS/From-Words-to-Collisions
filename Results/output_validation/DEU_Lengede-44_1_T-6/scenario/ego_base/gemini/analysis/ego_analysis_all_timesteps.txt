Obstacle 41 is moving away longitudinally but laterally towards the ego vehicle. It poses a medium risk as it is still within a reasonable distance, but the lateral movement might not lead to a collision in the very near future.

Obstacle 45 is approaching the ego vehicle both longitudinally and laterally. While the longitudinal velocity is high, the distance is significant enough to classify it as a medium risk. Further monitoring and potential maneuvering might be necessary.

Obstacle 109 is very close to the ego vehicle from behind and is approaching. Its longitudinal velocity is relatively low, but the proximity makes it a high-risk obstacle, requiring immediate attention to avoid a potential rear-end collision.

        "Reasoning": "Obstacle 109 presents a high risk due to its proximity and approach from behind. While no immediate collision is predicted in the next timestep, immediate action may be required to avoid a collision. Other obstacles present medium risk but are not on a direct collision course in the immediate future."
