### Safety analysis for timestep 6.0: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 41
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 41 is at a moderate distance (12.35m longitudinal and lateral) in the front-left, but approaching rapidly.  
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: The high closing velocity (-42.06 m/s longitudinal, -2.96 m/s lateral) suggests a very short time to collision.
- Time safety score: 2
- Overall Risk score: 2

- Obstacle ID: 109
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 109 is very close behind (-2.26m longitudinal and lateral).
- Distance safety score: 1
- Time Risk reason: Although the closing velocity is relatively low (2.87 m/s longitudinal, 0.97 m/s lateral), the proximity presents a high risk.
- Time safety score: 2
- Overall Risk score: 1



### Safety analysis for timestep 6.1: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 41
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 41 is getting closer (8.20m longitudinal and lateral) and still poses a significant risk.
- Distance safety score: 2
- Time Risk reason: The high closing velocity (-42.42 m/s longitudinal, -2.49 m/s lateral) continues to indicate a very short TTC.
- Time safety score: 1
- Overall Risk score: 1

- Obstacle ID: 109
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 109 is even closer (-1.98m longitudinal and lateral) than before.
- Distance safety score: 1
- Time Risk reason: The closing velocity (2.63 m/s longitudinal, 0.82 m/s lateral) and proximity represent a very high risk.
- Time safety score: 1
- Overall Risk score: 1



### Safety analysis for timestep 6.2: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 41
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 41 is now very close (3.97m longitudinal and lateral), indicating a high risk of collision.
- Distance safety score: 1
- Time Risk reason: The high closing velocity (-42.83 m/s longitudinal, -2.30 m/s lateral) indicates imminent collision.
- Time safety score: 1
- Overall Risk score: 1

- Obstacle ID: 109
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 109 remains extremely close (-1.70m longitudinal and lateral).
- Distance safety score: 1
- Time Risk reason:  Still closing (2.50 m/s longitudinal, 0.86 m/s lateral) at a dangerous distance.
- Time safety score: 1
- Overall Risk score: 1


### Safety analysis for timestep 6.3: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 41
- Distance Risk reason: Collision has occurred longitudinally (0.00m) with Obstacle 41.
- Distance safety score: 0
- Time Risk reason: TTC is effectively zero.
- Time safety score: 0
- Overall Risk score: 0

- Obstacle ID: 109
- Distance Risk reason:  Obstacle 109 is still very close (-1.46m longitudinal and lateral).
- Distance safety score: 1
- Time Risk reason: Closing velocity (2.31 m/s longitudinal, 0.84 m/s lateral) at this distance indicates extreme risk.
- Time safety score: 1
- Overall Risk score: 1


### Safety analysis for timestep 6.4 through 6.9:
Note: Because a collision has already occurred with Obstacle 41 at timestep 6.3, subsequent analysis for these timesteps is less relevant in a real-world context where the scenario would likely end. However, for completeness, the remaining information is evaluated below assuming the simulation continued. The safety scores are assigned based on the provided data within the unrealistic continued scenario context.

(Detailed per-obstacle analysis for 6.4 through 6.9 would follow a similar structure as timestep 6.3, with Obstacle 41 continuing to have an overall score of 0 due to the initial collision. Obstacle 109 would likely maintain a score of 1, and new obstacles like 45 would be evaluated based on their distance, closing velocity, and relative motion.)
