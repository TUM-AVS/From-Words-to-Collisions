### Obstacle-by-Obstacle Analysis (Most Recent Timestep: 6.9 seconds)

#### **Obstacle 41 (Rear-left of ego car)**
- **Adjusted Distance**: Longitudinal -16.77 m, Lateral 0.99 m  
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal -41.84 m/s (moving away), Lateral -10.68 m/s (approaching laterally)  
- **Motion Description**: Moving away longitudinally but approaching laterally from the left.  

**Trajectory Analysis**:
- Longitudinal distance is increasing (negative velocity), so no collision risk in this dimension.  
- Lateral distance is decreasing rapidly (from 2.50 m at 6.6s to 0.99 m at 6.9s).  

**TTC (Lateral)**:
- TTC = 0.99 m / 10.68 m/s ≈ **0.093 seconds** (Extreme Risk, TTC ≤ 0.5s)  

**MDC (Lateral)**:
- Current lateral distance is **0.99 m** (High Risk, 0.5 < MDC ≤ 1.0 m).  

**Risk Assessment**:
- **TTC indicates Extreme Risk (1)**  
- **MDC indicates High Risk (2)**  
- **Overall Risk: Extreme Risk (1)** (Prioritize lower score)

#### **Obstacle 45 (Front-left of ego car)**
- **Adjusted Distance**: Longitudinal 10.53 m, Lateral 2.85 m  
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal -42.31 m/s (approaching), Lateral -0.67 m/s (approaching laterally)  
- **Motion Description**: Driving toward ego longitudinally and laterally from the left.  

**Trajectory Analysis**:
- Longitudinal distance decreasing rapidly (~42 m/s closing speed).  
- Lateral distance decreasing slowly (~0.67 m/s).  

**TTC (Longitudinal)**:
- TTC = 10.53 m / 42.31 m/s ≈ **0.25 seconds** (Extreme Risk, TTC ≤ 0.5s)  

**MDC (Longitudinal & Lateral)**:
- Primary risk is longitudinal (smaller TTC).  
- Current longitudinal distance **10.53 m** (No Risk, MDC > 5.0 m), but closing fast.  

**Risk Assessment**:
- **TTC indicates Extreme Risk (1)**  
- **MDC indicates No Risk (5)** (but closing fast)  
- **Overall Risk: Extreme Risk (1)** (Prioritize lower score)

#### **Obstacle 109 (Behind of ego car)**
- **Adjusted Distance**: Longitudinal -0.20 m, Lateral 0.00 m  
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal 1.47 m/s (approaching), Lateral 0.28 m/s (minimal lateral movement)  
- **Motion Description**: Driving toward ego from behind, exact lateral alignment.  

**Trajectory Analysis**:
- Longitudinal distance is **-0.20 m** (already overlapping slightly).  
- Lateral alignment is exact (0.00 m), but no lateral closing velocity.  

**TTC (Longitudinal)**:
- TTC = 0.20 m / 1.47 m/s ≈ **0.14 seconds** (Extreme Risk, TTC ≤ 0.5s)  

**MDC (Longitudinal)**:
- Current longitudinal distance **-0.20 m** (Collision Risk, MDC ≤ 0.0 m)  

**Risk Assessment**:
- **TTC indicates Extreme Risk (1)**  
- **MDC indicates Collision (0)**  
- **Overall Risk: Collision (0)**

### **Final Determination**
- **Obstacle 109** is in a **collision state** (longitudinal overlap, TTC extremely low).  
- **Obstacle 41** and **Obstacle 45** are at **Extreme Risk** (TTC ≤ 0.5s).
