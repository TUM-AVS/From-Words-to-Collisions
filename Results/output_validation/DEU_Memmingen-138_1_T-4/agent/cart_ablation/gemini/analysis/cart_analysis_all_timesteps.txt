Here's the collision risk analysis:

**Obstacle 20036:** This obstacle is in the same lane as the ego vehicle and, throughout the provided timesteps, its y-coordinate is approaching the ego vehicle's y-coordinate. Initially, obstacle 20036 is behind the ego vehicle, but it gets progressively closer.  By 6.8 seconds, obstacle 20036's y-coordinate (-75.4005) is only slightly behind the ego vehicle's (-70.8745) meaning it is getting considerably closer and the x coordinates also reflect a closing gap. Though a collision hasn't happened yet, the consistent approach and decreasing distance over multiple timesteps indicate a very high probability of collision in the immediate future if the ego vehicle doesn't take evasive maneuvers. Risk score: 1 (Extreme Risk).

**Obstacle 20037:**  This obstacle is in a different lane (1962) than the ego vehicle (1963).  While its y-coordinate suggests movement in a roughly parallel direction to the ego vehicle, the x-coordinate difference maintains lateral separation. There is no indication of any potential collision. Risk score: 5 (Negligible Risk).

**Obstacle 20038:** This obstacle is in the same lane as the ego vehicle and, throughout the provided timesteps, is consistently behind the ego vehicle. The difference in y-coordinate increases between ego and the obstacle across the timesteps. Although in the same lane, the obstacle poses no immediate collision risk. Risk score: 5 (Negligible Risk).

**Obstacle 20039:**  This obstacle is in a different lane (1962) from the ego vehicle (1963).  Its y-coordinate values are significantly smaller than the ego vehicle's, indicating it's much further ahead and diverging. There is no collision risk. Risk score: 5 (Negligible Risk).

**Obstacle 20033:** This obstacle appears only in the last two timesteps in the context, seemingly coming from the front side, based on its Y coordinate, of the ego vehicle. At its first appearance, the obstacle is on the same lanelet as the ego vehicle, but the distance shows no immediate collision risk. Risk score: 5 (Negligible Risk).
