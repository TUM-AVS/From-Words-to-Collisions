Here's the analysis of the provided scenario:

**Obstacle 20036:** This obstacle is in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle and initially poses a high risk.  Over the timesteps, the x-position of obstacle 20036 becomes negative, going from 0.982 at t=5.9 to -0.91 at t=6.8 while the ego vehicle's x-position remains near 0 and slightly negative.  The y-positions also get closer.  This suggests a likely collision if the trends continue. Therefore, I classify this obstacle as high risk (2) currently, potentially escalating to extreme risk (1) very soon.

**Obstacle 20037:** This obstacle is in a different lanelet (1962) than the ego vehicle (1963).  The y-positions are getting further apart with obstacle 20037 moving further south down the road. Although the x-position difference decreases slightly, the lane separation suggests it is not an immediate threat and thus poses a low risk (4).

**Obstacle 20038:** This obstacle is in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle but initially quite far behind it.  The y distance between them is shrinking, but much more slowly than with obstacle 20036.  However, given its same-lanelet presence, the lateral distance is not a major factor, thus assigning a medium risk (3).

**Obstacle 20039:**  This obstacle appears at t=6.1s and is in a different lanelet (1962) than the ego vehicle (1963). Its y-position is much further ahead and appears to be diverging, suggesting low risk (4).

**Obstacle 20033:** This obstacle appears at t=6.6s in the ego vehicle's lane and is far ahead, posing a negligible risk (5).
