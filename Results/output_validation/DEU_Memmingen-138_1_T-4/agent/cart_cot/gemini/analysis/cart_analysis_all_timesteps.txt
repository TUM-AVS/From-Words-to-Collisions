Obstacle 20036 is showing a decreasing trend in its y-coordinate, moving closer to the ego vehicle's y-coordinate.  While the x-coordinate difference suggests some lateral separation, the continuous approach in the y-direction warrants attention. Further observation is needed to determine if evasive action will be necessary. Obstacle 20033 is also in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle, but farther away and slower, posing a low risk currently. Other obstacles are in different lanelets, making them currently low risk.
