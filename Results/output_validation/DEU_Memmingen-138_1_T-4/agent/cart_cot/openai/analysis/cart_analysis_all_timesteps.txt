### Analysis:

In this scenario, we are tasked with analyzing the positions, velocities, and accelerations of the ego vehicle and several obstacles.

1. **Ego Vehicle:**
   - At 6.8 seconds, the ego vehicle is at (-0.3314, -70.8745) with a velocity of 7.1671 and decelerating with -0.7033.

2. **Relative Motion Analysis:**
   - **Obstacle 20036.0** is moving parallel and relatively close (around 4.526 meters away at 6.8 seconds) in the same lanelet (1963). With its velocity (7.9336) being slightly higher than the ego's, it closes distance fast, increasing the risk of collision. This is concerning considering they share the same lane.
   - **Obstacle 20037.0** is on a convergent path and approaching significantly due to its higher velocity. However, being in a different lanelet (1962) reduces immediate risk but still warrants caution.
   - **Obstacle 20038.0** is further away both in positioning (9.708 meters away at 6.8 seconds) and doesn't present an immediate threat despite sharing the same lanelet.
   - **Obstacle 20039.0** is consistently maintaining a parallel path in a different lanelet (1962), continuing a safe trajectory with consistent distances.

3. **Risk Assessment:**
   - **Obstacle 20036.0** appears to present an immediate high risk due to sharing the lanelet with the ego vehicle, both maintaining similar orientations, and due to proximity.
   - **Obstacle 20037.0** potentially poses a Medium Risk since it appears to operate mainly in a parallel or different trajectory.
   - **Obstacle 20038.0** and **Obstacle 20039.0** show no immediate risk due to their distance and differing lanelet occupancy relative to the ego.

### JSON Output:

```json
{
    "CollisionObstacles": [],
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "20036.0",
        "OverallRiskScore": 1
    },
    "HighRiskObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "20037.0",
        "OverallRiskScore": 2
    }
}
```

The JSON output highlights "Obstacle 20036.0" as an extreme risk due to its proximity and sharing the same lane trajectory as the ego vehicle. "Obstacle 20037.0" is categorized under high risk, but not imminent collision as it is in a different lanelet.
