To analyze the scenario with the most recent timestamp at 6.8 seconds:

1. **Ego Vehicle (Ego: 20034.0)**:
   - Position: (-0.3314, -70.8745)
   - Velocity: 7.1671
   - Acceleration: -0.7033

2. **Obstacle 20036.0**:
   - Position: (-0.91, -75.4005)
   - Same lanelet as the ego vehicle.
   - Relative distance to Ego: ~4.53m behind.
   - Velocity: 7.9336 (slightly faster than Ego, closing in)
   - Relative longitudinal velocity = 7.9336 - 7.1671 = 0.7665 (approaching)

   Given the relative distance and speed:
   - This obstacle could potentially close the gap quickly.
   - **TTC = 4.53 / 0.7665 = ~5.91 seconds** (approaching but manageable)
   - **Risk Level:** 3 (Medium Risk; manageable with system response)

3. **Obstacle 20037.0**:
   - Position: (-2.5776, -82.817), different lanelet.
   - Relative lateral distance: ~11.94m (lane shift required for collision), high speed.
   - **Risk Level:** 4 (Low Risk; significant lateral distance)

4. **Obstacle 20038.0**: 
   - Position: (9.2397, -92.7109)
   - Located at a significant lateral position, behind and to the side.
   - **Risk Level:** 5 (Negligible Risk; too far laterally and behind)

5. **Obstacle 20039.0**: 
   - Position: (-4.5098, -56.9756)
   - Not moving into the lane of the Ego, in different lanelet.
   - **Risk Level:** 4 (Low Risk; no immediate threat)

6. **Obstacle 20033.0**: 
   - Position: (-0.4553, -42.2465), further from Ego and decelerating.
   - **Risk Level:** 5 (Negligible Risk; far and moving away)

### Analysis Summary:
- Obstacle **20036.0** poses a **Medium Risk** because it is rapidly closing in on the Ego vehicle in the same lanelet.
- None of the obstacles present a risk level of 0 or 1 based on distance, velocity, and lanelet interactions.
