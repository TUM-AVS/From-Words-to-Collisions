### Safety analysis for timestep 6.8s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 20033**
- Distance Risk reason: Located 24.07m longitudinally and 24.07m laterally in the Front-right.  Poses no immediate risk.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: The large longitudinal and lateral distances suggest ample time to react.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 20036**
- Distance Risk reason: Collision imminent. Longitudinal and lateral distances are both 0.00m, indicating a collision at the current timestep.
- Distance safety score: 0
- Time Risk reason: Collision imminent.
- Time safety score: 0
- Overall Risk score: 0

- **Obstacle ID: 20037**
- Distance Risk reason: Located 7.27m longitudinally and 7.27m laterally in the Rear-left. While moving closer laterally, the longitudinal distance suggests a safe margin.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: The lateral movement needs monitoring, but the current distances provide sufficient time to react.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 20038**
- Distance Risk reason: Located 17.88m longitudinally and 17.88m laterally to the Rear-right.  No immediate risk.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Ample time to react due to large distances. Lateral movement needs continued monitoring, but presents no current risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 20039**
- Distance Risk reason: Located 9.62m longitudinally and 9.62m laterally to the Front-left.  No immediate risk.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Sufficient time to react.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4
