### Obstacle-by-Obstacle Analysis (Most Recent Timestep: 6.8s)

---

#### **Obstacle 20033 (Front-right)**
- **Position**: Front-right (longitudinal 24.07m, lateral -0.05m)
- **Relative Velocity**: longitudinal -4.90 m/s (approaching), lateral -0.26 m/s (moving away)
- **Motion**: Approaching longitudinally, moving away laterally.
- **TTC Longitudinal**: 24.07 / 4.90 ≈ 4.91s (Low Risk, TTC > 5.0s is No Risk, but close)
- **TTC Lateral**: Not applicable (moving away)
- **MDC**: Lateral distance is negligible (0.05m), but trajectories are diverging.
- **Risk**: 5 (Negligible Risk). No collision risk due to diverging paths.

#### **Obstacle 20036 (Collision)**
- **Position**: Collision (longitudinal 0.00m, lateral 0.00m)
- **Relative Velocity**: longitudinal 0.77 m/s (approaching), lateral 0.08 m/s (approaching)
- **Motion**: Exact alignment in both dimensions with closing velocity.
- **TTC Longitudinal**: 0.00 / 0.77 = 0s (Collision)
- **TTC Lateral**: 0.00 / 0.08 = 0s (Collision)
- **MDC**: 0m in both dimensions.
- **Risk**: 0 (Collision). Physical contact is occurring.

#### **Obstacle 20037 (Rear-left)**
- **Position**: Rear-left (longitudinal -7.27m, lateral 1.38m)
- **Relative Velocity**: longitudinal -19.73 m/s (moving away), lateral -4.86 m/s (approaching)
- **Motion**: Moving away longitudinally, approaching laterally.
- **TTC Longitudinal**: Not applicable (moving away)
- **TTC Lateral**: 1.38 / 4.86 ≈ 0.28s (Extreme Risk)
- **MDC**: Lateral distance is 1.38m, but closing rapidly.
- **Risk**: 1 (Extreme Risk). High lateral closing velocity.
