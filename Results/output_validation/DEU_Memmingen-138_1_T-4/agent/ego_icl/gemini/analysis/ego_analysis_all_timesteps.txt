* **Obstacle 20033:** Located in the Front-right, longitudinal 24.07m, lateral -0.05m.  Moving towards the ego car longitudinally at -4.90 m/s but slightly away laterally at -0.26 m/s. No immediate risk.  Longitudinal TTC is approximately 4.91s (24.07/4.90) and lateral TTC is not applicable due to divergent direction. This obstacle poses a low risk (4) due to the longitudinal proximity.

* **Obstacle 20036:** Collision. Located Behind, longitudinal 0.00 m and lateral 0.00 m.  The motion description confirms "Collision".  Both TTC and MDC are zero. This obstacle poses a collision risk (0).

* **Obstacle 20037:** Located in the Rear-left, longitudinal -7.27m, lateral 1.38m. Moving away longitudinally (-19.73 m/s) but towards the ego car laterally (4.86 m/s). Lateral TTC is approximately 0.28s (1.38/4.86). This obstacle poses an extreme risk (1) due to the low lateral TTC, despite the negative longitudinal distance, suggesting that this obstacle will side sweep the ego vehicle.

* **Obstacle 20038:** Located in the Rear-right, longitudinal -17.88m, lateral -6.58m. Moving away longitudinally (-1.97 m/s) and towards the ego car laterally (4.85 m/s). Lateral TTC is approximately 1.36s (6.58/4.85). This obstacle poses a medium risk (3) due to the lateral motion.

* **Obstacle 20039:** Located in the Front-left, longitudinal 9.62m, lateral 1.69m. Moving towards the ego car longitudinally at -20.42 m/s, but away laterally at 1.24 m/s. Longitudinal TTC is approximately 0.47s (9.62/20.42) and lateral TTC is not applicable due to divergent direction.  This obstacle poses an extreme risk (1) due to the low longitudinal TTC.
