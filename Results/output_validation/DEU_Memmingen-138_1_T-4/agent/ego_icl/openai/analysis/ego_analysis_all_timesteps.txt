### Obstacle Analysis for Most Recent Timestep (6.8 seconds):

1. **Obstacle 20033:**
   - Position: Front-right
   - Adjusted Distances: Longitudinal 24.07 m, Lateral -0.05 m
   - Relative Velocity: Longitudinal -4.90 m/s, Lateral -0.26 m/s
   - Motion: Approaching longitudinally and slightly moving away laterally
   - **Assessment**:
     - **TTC** (Longitudinal): 24.07 m / 4.90 m/s ≈ 4.91 seconds
     - **MDC**: > 5.0 m in both dimensions
     - **Risk**: Low Risk (4) due to sufficient time-to-collision and minimal lateral alignment risk.

2. **Obstacle 20036:**
   - Position: Collision (Overlaps ego)
   - Adjusted Distances: Longitudinal 0.00 m, Lateral 0.00 m
   - Relative Velocity: Longitudinal 0.77 m/s, Lateral 0.08 m/s
   - Motion: Exact alignment in both dimensions
   - **Assessment**:
     - **Risk**: Collision (0) due to zero adjusted distance in both dimensions, indicating a current collision.

3. **Obstacle 20037:**
   - Position: Rear-left
   - Adjusted Distances: Longitudinal -7.27 m, Lateral 1.38 m
   - Relative Velocity: Longitudinal -19.73 m/s, Lateral -4.86 m/s
   - Motion: Moving away longitudinally, approaching laterally
   - **Assessment**:
     - **TTC** (Lateral): 1.38 m / 4.86 m/s ≈ 0.28 seconds
     - **MDC**: < 1.0 m laterally
     - **Risk**: Extreme Risk (1) due to very short lateral TTC.

4. **Obstacle 20038:**
   - Position: Rear-right
   - Adjusted Distances: Longitudinal -17.88 m, Lateral -6.58 m
   - Relative Velocity: Longitudinal -1.97 m/s, Lateral 4.85 m/s
   - Motion: Moving away longitudinally, approaching laterally
   - **Assessment**:
     - **TTC** (Lateral): 6.58 m / 4.85 m/s ≈ 1.36 seconds
     - **MDC**: > 5.0 m
     - **Risk**: Medium Risk (3) primarily due to lateral movement.

5. **Obstacle 20039:**
   - Position: Front-left
   - Adjusted Distances: Longitudinal 9.62 m, Lateral 1.69 m
   - Relative Velocity: Longitudinal -20.42 m/s, Lateral 1.24 m/s
   - Motion: Driving toward the ego car longitudinally, moving away laterally
   - **Assessment**:
     - **TTC** (Longitudinal): 9.62 m / 20.42 m/s ≈ 0.47 seconds
     - **MDC**: < 1.0 m
     - **Risk**: Extreme Risk (1) due to imminent longitudinal collision risk.

- **Explanation**: Obstacle 20036 is in immediate collision as its adjusted distance is zero in both dimensions. Obstacle 20039 is at extreme risk due to a very low time-to-collision from the front, and Obstacle 20037 is also at extreme risk primarily due to rapidly closing lateral distance indicating urgent collision potential.
