At t=7.0s, Ego is in lanelet 1963.0 at (-0.4308, -69.4435) with a velocity of 6.8645 m/s.

Obstacle 20036 is also in lanelet 1963.0 at (-1.0258, -73.8215) with a velocity of 7.8981 m/s.  While the y-coordinates indicate some distance, the x-coordinates are very close. Considering the velocities and the past trajectory data showing these obstacles converging, an extreme risk of collision exists.

Obstacle 20033 is in the same lanelet as Ego at (-0.4341, -41.8229), far ahead of Ego and moving slower.  This obstacle poses no immediate risk.

Obstacles 20037, 20038, and 20039 are in a different lanelet. Obstacle 20038, while in the same lanelet as the Ego vehicle, is far behind. Obstacles 20037 and 20039 are also far from Ego and pose negligible risk in this timestep.
