At t=7.0s, Ego is in lanelet 1963.0 at (-0.4308, -69.4435) with a velocity of 6.8645 m/s.

* Obstacle 20036.0 is also in lanelet 1963.0 at (-1.0258, -73.8215) with velocity 7.8981 m/s.  Although the y-coordinate difference is significant (~4.4m), the trajectories over the past few timesteps suggest a closing distance.  This obstacle presents a potential risk if Ego maintains its current trajectory, but it does not represent an *immediate* collision risk. Risk score: 2 (High).

* Obstacle 20038.0 is also in lanelet 1963.0 at (8.1932, -91.7211).  The large difference in both x and y coordinates, as well as the trajectory history indicates low risk. Risk score: 4 (Low).

* Obstacles 20037.0 and 20039.0 are in lanelet 1962.0.  Their trajectories show no indication of crossing into lanelet 1963.0, representing negligible risk. Risk score: 5 (Negligible).

* Obstacle 20033.0 is in lanelet 1963.0 at (-0.4341, -41.8229). While in the same lanelet, this obstacle is significantly further ahead (y difference >27m) and moving slowly. It poses no immediate risk. Risk score: 5 (Negligible).
