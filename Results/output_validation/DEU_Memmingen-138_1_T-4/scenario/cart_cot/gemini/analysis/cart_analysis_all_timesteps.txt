### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 20033.0
- Distance Risk reason: This obstacle is far ahead of the ego vehicle and in the same lanelet.  Its trajectory over the past several timesteps indicates it is moving slower than the ego vehicle.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: The large relative distance and the slower speed of the obstacle suggest ample time to react.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 20036.0
- Distance Risk reason: This obstacle is in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle and somewhat behind it. Observing the trajectory shows the obstacle is moving slightly faster than the ego vehicle.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: While the obstacle is approaching, the relative velocities and current distance suggest a low risk in the short term.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- Obstacle ID: 20037.0
- Distance Risk reason: This obstacle is in a different lanelet and poses no immediate threat based on its lateral position. Its historical trajectory confirms it's moving away from the ego vehicle's path.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: The lateral separation and diverging trajectories indicate no time-related collision risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 20038.0
- Distance Risk reason: This obstacle is significantly behind the ego vehicle and to its right, in the same lane.  Its trajectory shows consistent movement in the same general direction as the ego vehicle.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: The large distance and similar velocities minimize the risk of a time-related collision.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 20039.0
- Distance Risk reason: This obstacle is far ahead of the ego vehicle and in a different lanelet. The historical trajectory shows a clear separation between the two vehicles' paths.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: The substantial distance and different lanelets imply no imminent time-based collision risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5


### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. **Most critical obstacles:** Obstacle 20036.0 is the most critical as it's in the same lane and closing the distance, although relatively slowly.
2. **Trajectory analysis:** Over the 10 timesteps, Obstacle 20036.0 consistently moves faster than the ego vehicle, but the relative difference in speed is small.
3. **Relative position, velocity, and acceleration:** Obstacle 20036.0 is behind the ego vehicle, meaning the ego is moving away from it. The difference in speed is not drastic enough to predict a collision in the near future. The accelerations are also relatively stable.
4. **Collision determination:** No collision has occurred or appears imminent based on the current data.
5. **Reasoning:** While obstacle 20036.0 is gaining on the ego vehicle, the rate of approach is low, and there is ample space and time for the ego vehicle to react if necessary.
