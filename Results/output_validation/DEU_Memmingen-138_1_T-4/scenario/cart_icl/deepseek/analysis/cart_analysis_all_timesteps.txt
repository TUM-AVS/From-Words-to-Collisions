### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. No obstacles are in immediate collision path (risk score 0).
2. Obstacle 20033.0 is the highest risk (score 3) due to same lanelet and moving towards ego, but decelerating.
3. All other obstacles are either in different lanelets, moving away, or have low relative velocity.
4. Ego vehicle is maintaining safe distance from all obstacles.
