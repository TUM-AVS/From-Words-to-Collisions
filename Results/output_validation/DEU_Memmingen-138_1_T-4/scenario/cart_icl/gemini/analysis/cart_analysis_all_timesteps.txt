### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 20033.0
- Distance Risk reason: Far away from ego vehicle and in the same lane. No immediate risk.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason:  Moving slower than ego but far enough away. No immediate time-related risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 20036.0
- Distance Risk reason: In the same lane and moderately close, but moving slower.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason:  Closing distance but slower than ego. Requires monitoring.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3

- Obstacle ID: 20037.0
- Distance Risk reason: In a different lane and moving away laterally.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Moving faster than ego, but diverging paths. No immediate time risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 20038.0
- Distance Risk reason: Behind ego and in the same lane, but moderately far.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Moving slower than ego and not closing rapidly.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- Obstacle ID: 20039.0
- Distance Risk reason: In different lane and far away from ego vehicle, posing no immediate risk.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Moving faster than ego, but diverging paths. No immediate time risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5


### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
No obstacle has a risk score of 0, so it's not a collision scenario. No obstacle has a risk score of 1, so no extreme risk. Obstacle 20036.0 requires monitoring as it's in the same lane and moderately close, but its slower speed lowers the immediate risk.

### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
  "CollisionObstacles": null,
  "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null,
  "ScenarioAnalysis": {
    "IsCollisionScenario": false,
    "Reasoning": "No obstacle has a risk score of 0 or 1. Obstacle 20036.0 presents a moderate risk (score 3) due to proximity and shared lane, but its slower speed reduces immediate danger."
  }
}
