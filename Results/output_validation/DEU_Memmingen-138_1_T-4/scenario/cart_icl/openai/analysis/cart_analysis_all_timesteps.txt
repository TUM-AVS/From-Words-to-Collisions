### Obstacle Analysis:
#### Obstacle 20036.0:
- **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle's trajectory shows steadily decreasing distance from the ego. Both vehicles are in the same lanelet (1963) and have similar orientations. The distance reduction from initial (6.1s) to final step (7.0s) indicates potential proximity.

- **Distance safety score**: 2 (High risk due to same lane proximity and steady approach)

- **Time Risk reason**: Relative velocity differences are minimal, and both are decelerating slightly, indicating a stable approach but enabling further time for risk mitigation.

- **Time safety score**: 3 (Medium risk with reactive potential)

- **Overall Risk score**: 2

#### Obstacle 20037.0:
- **Distance Risk reason**: Positioned in a different lanelet (1962) with initial distance widening, yet begins more angular shifts towards the ego as observed through orientation change.

- **Distance safety score**: 3 (Medium risk; not in immediate ego path but might align more closely)

- **Time Risk reason**: Higher velocity and relatively stable trajectory but does not appear to be in direct conflict given current motion vectors.

- **Time safety score**: 4 (Low risk)

- **Overall Risk score**: 3

#### Obstacle 20038.0:
- **Distance Risk reason**: Consistent distance from the ego in a parallel lane (1963), indicating no immediate intersection path despite being in the observable area.

- **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low risk)

- **Time Risk reason**: Velocity trends hold steady without signs of quickening longitudinal approach, reducing near-term collision likelihood.

- **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible risk)

- **Overall Risk score**: 4

#### Obstacle 20039.0:
- **Distance Risk reason**: Positioned farthest away in a different lanelet (1962) and maintaining consistent pace, keeping away from impact risk.

- **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible risk)

- **Time Risk reason**: Persistent steady velocity lessens urgent risk timelines, though overspeed remains a distant consideration.

- **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible risk)

- **Overall Risk score**: 5

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
This scenario does not present an immediate collision risk despite proximity with obstacle 20036.0 due to maintained controllable distance and speed consistency. The trajectory history provides insight into the deceleration trends, and while there's high risk of close parallel travel, active attention is sufficient for collision avoidance. No other obstacles present an immediate threat based on their trajectories and relative velocities.
