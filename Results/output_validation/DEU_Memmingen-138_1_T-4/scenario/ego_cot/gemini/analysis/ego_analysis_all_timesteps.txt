### Safety analysis for timestep 6.1-7.0: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

**Methodology:**

Given the data, precise TTC and MDC calculations are challenging due to the lack of explicit ego vehicle motion information.  We rely on relative motion and distances.  A qualitative approach is used, focusing on the risk level categorization based on relative motion, distance, and stated "Collision" status.

**Assumptions:**

* "Collision" designation indicates a score of 0.
* Scores are assigned considering both longitudinal and lateral movement.
* We assume a collision is imminent (score 1) if the relative distance is near zero and the obstacle is moving towards the ego vehicle.


### Obstacle Analysis:

**Timestep 6.1 - 6.7:**

- **Obstacle ID:** 20036
- Distance Risk reason:  Initially behind and very close, progressively getting closer to the ego vehicle.
- Distance safety score: Decreasing from 2 to 1 over these timesteps.
- Time Risk reason: Relative motion indicates closing, very short time to potential collision.
- Time safety score: Decreasing from 2 to 1 over these timesteps.
- Overall Risk score: Decreasing from 2 to 1 over these timesteps.

- **Obstacle ID:** 20037
- Distance Risk reason: Initially to the left, some distance away from the ego vehicle, then moves to the rear-left and closer.
- Distance safety score: Varies between 3 and 4
- Time Risk reason: Moves away longitudinally.
- Time safety score: 4-5
- Overall Risk score: 4

- **Obstacle ID:** 20038
- Distance Risk reason: Rear-right and far from the ego vehicle, moving slightly closer laterally.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Moving away longitudinally.
- Time safety score: 4-5
- Overall Risk score: 4-5

- **Obstacle ID:** 20039
- Distance Risk reason: Front-left and far, gradually getting closer to the ego vehicle but laterally moving away.
- Distance safety score: 4-5
- Time Risk reason:  Moving towards the ego car longitudinally but away laterally, enough time to react.
- Time safety score: 3-4
- Overall Risk score: 3-4

- **Obstacle ID:** 20033 (appears at 6.6)
- Distance Risk reason: Front of ego vehicle.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Approaching ego vehicle longitudinally.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3


**Timestep 6.8 - 7.0:**

- **Obstacle ID:** 20036
- Distance Risk reason: Explicitly stated as "Collision."
- Distance safety score: 0
- Time Risk reason: Collision imminent.
- Time safety score: 0
- Overall Risk score: 0

- **Obstacle ID:** 20037  (and other obstacles besides 20036)
- Analysis remains similar to previous timesteps, adjusting scores based on relative distances and motions as described above.
