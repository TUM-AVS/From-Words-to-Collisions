Let's conduct an analysis of the most recent timestep (7.0 seconds) for each obstacle using the instructions provided:

### Obstacle Analysis at 7.0 Seconds

#### Obstacle 20033 (Front-right of ego car)

- **Adjusted Distances**: Longitudinal 23.04 m, Lateral -0.36 m
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal -4.92 m/s, Lateral -0.24 m/s
- **Motion**: Driving toward the ego car longitudinally, moving away laterally

**Analysis**:
- **Longitudinal Risk**:
  - Relative velocity indicates the obstacle is approaching the ego car.
  - TTC (Longitudinal) = 23.04 / 4.92 ≈ 4.68 seconds. This indicates a Low Risk.

- **Lateral Risk**:
  - Lateral velocity is small and moving away, indicating increasing separation.
  - MDC is large (greater than 5 m in both lateral and longitudinal), suggesting No Risk.

**Overall Risk Score: 5** (No Risk)

#### Obstacle 20036 (Collision of ego car)

- **Adjusted Distances**: Longitudinal 0.00 m, Lateral 0.00 m
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal 1.03 m/s, Lateral 0.01 m/s
- **Motion**: Exact longitudinal and lateral alignment

**Analysis**:
- This obstacle is in a collision position with both distances at 0. The relative velocity indicates it's in continuous contact or about to be.
- **Overall Risk Score: 0** (Collision occurring)

#### Obstacle 20037 (Rear-left of ego car)

- **Adjusted Distances**: Longitudinal -11.15 m, Lateral 0.37 m
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal -18.91 m/s, Lateral -6.10 m/s
- **Motion**: Moving away longitudinally, approaching laterally

**Analysis**:
- **Longitudinal Risk**:
  - The negative velocities show the obstacle moving away.
  - No immediate collision path being followed.

- **Lateral Risk**:
  - Although lateral velocity towards suggests closing, the overall distance is safe enough given continued motion away.

**Overall Risk Score: 5** (No Risk)

#### Obstacle 20038 (Rear-right of ego car)

- **Adjusted Distances**: Longitudinal -18.33 m, Lateral -5.40 m
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal -1.49 m/s, Lateral 4.93 m/s
- **Motion**: Moving away longitudinally, approaching laterally

**Analysis**:
- **Longitudinal Risk**:
  - Moving away discerning a low collision likelihood.
  
- **Lateral Risk**:
  - Despite the converging lateral motion, sufficient distance indicates reduced risk probability.

**Overall Risk Score: 5** (No Risk)

#### Obstacle 20039 (Front-left of ego car)

- **Adjusted Distances**: Longitudinal 5.53 m, Lateral 1.85 m
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal -20.15 m/s, Lateral 1.36 m/s
- **Motion**: Driving toward longitudinally but moving away laterally

**Analysis**:
- **Longitudinal Risk**:
  - TTC (Longitudinal) = 5.53 / 20.15 ≈ 0.27 seconds, but lateral motion means no direct path alignment.
 
- **Lateral Risk**:
  - Increase in lateral distance diminishes likelihood of imminent collision.
  
**Overall Risk Score: 4** (Low Risk due to decreasing lateral risk)

### Collision Scenario Determination
- **Obstacle 20036** has a risk score of 0, indicating an actual collision occurring.
- No other obstacles present extreme or higher risks.

### Conclusion
This constitutes a collision scenario due to the presence of a collision situation with Obstacle 20036.
