    - Overall Distance Safety Score: 0.0 (0 * 1.0 + 0 * 0.0)
    - Time Risk Reason: TTClong is 0.0s and TTClat is 0.0s.  This indicates a collision. Over time, TTClong has been decreasing.
    - Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 0
    - Lateral Time Safety Score: 0
    - Overall Time Safety Score: 0.0 (0 * 1.0 + 0 * 0.0)
    - Overall Risk Score: 0 (round(0.5 * 0.0 + 0.5 * 0.0) = round(0))

    - Obstacle ID: 20037
    - Relative Direction: Rear-left
    - Distance Risk Reason: DTClong is 11.15m and DTClat is 0.37m.  The obstacle is far away longitudinally and very close laterally. Over time, the obstacle moved further longitudinally but closed in laterally.
    - Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 5
    - Lateral Distance Safety Score: 1
    - Overall Distance Safety Score: 3.0 (5 * 0.5 + 1 * 0.5)
    - Time Risk Reason: TTClong is inf and TTClat is 0.06s, which is extremely risky.  Over time, TTClat has drastically decreased.
    - Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 5
    - Lateral Time Safety Score: 1
    - Overall Time Safety Score: 3.0 (5 * 0.5 + 1 * 0.5)
    - Overall Risk Score: 3 (round(0.5 * 3.0 + 0.5 * 3.0) = round(3))

    - Obstacle ID: 20038
    - Relative Direction: Rear-right
    - Distance Risk Reason: DTClong is 18.33m and DTClat is 5.40m. The obstacle is far away longitudinally and at a safe lateral distance. Over time, the obstacle has moved slightly further longitudinally but has been approaching laterally.
    - Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 5
    - Lateral Distance Safety Score: 4
    - Overall Distance Safety Score: 4.5 (5 * 0.5 + 4 * 0.5)
    - Time Risk Reason: TTClong is inf and TTClat is 1.10s.  The obstacle poses a high lateral collision risk. TTClat has been steadily decreasing over time.
    - Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 5
    - Lateral Time Safety Score: 2
    - Overall Time Safety Score: 3.5 (5 * 0.5 + 2 * 0.5)
    - Overall Risk Score: 4 (round(0.5 * 4.5 + 0.5 * 3.5) = round(4))

    - Obstacle ID: 20039
    - Relative Direction: Front-left
    - Distance Risk Reason: DTClong is 5.53m and DTClat is 1.85m. The obstacle poses a medium longitudinal risk but a medium lateral risk. Over time, the obstacle has been approaching longitudinally but moving slightly away laterally.
    - Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 4
    - Lateral Distance Safety Score: 3
    - Overall Distance Safety Score: 3.5 (4 * 0.5 + 3 * 0.5)
    - Time Risk Reason: TTClong is 0.27s which indicates extreme risk, and TTClat is inf meaning no lateral risk. Over time, TTClong has been decreasing steadily.
    - Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 1
