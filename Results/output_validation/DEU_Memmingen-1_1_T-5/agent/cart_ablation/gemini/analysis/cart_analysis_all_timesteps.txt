Here's the collision risk analysis:

**Obstacle 20052:** This obstacle is initially in the same lane as the ego vehicle and moving considerably faster.  Over the time steps, the distance between the vehicles decreases. Though no collision occurs within these timesteps, the closing speed and proximity suggest a high risk of collision in the near future. Because a collision hasn't happened yet and isn't guaranteed in the next immediate moment, we classify this as a *High Risk (2)* for the last provided timestep. It requires attention and likely some action from the ego vehicle to mitigate the collision risk. This obstacle is a Predicted Extreme Risk (1) obstacle.

**Obstacle 20044:** This obstacle appears from timestep 3.7 seconds and located in different lanelet. Its trajectory does not intersect with the ego vehicle's path within the given timeframe. It seems to be located in lanelet 3429, while the ego vehicle remains in lanelet 3428. Thus it currently presents a *Negligible Risk (5)*.
