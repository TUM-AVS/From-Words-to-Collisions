Obstacle 20052 initially poses a high risk. Both ego and obstacle 20052 are in the same lanelet and the obstacle is moving significantly faster than the ego vehicle.  The distance between them is decreasing over each timestep. However, towards the later timesteps, the rate of closure decreases significantly, suggesting a reduced risk.  A new obstacle 20044 appears in a different lanelet in the last few timesteps. Based on its trajectory, it does not pose an immediate threat.
