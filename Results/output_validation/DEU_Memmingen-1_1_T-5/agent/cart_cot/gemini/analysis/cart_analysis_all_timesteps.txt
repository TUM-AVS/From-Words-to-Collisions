At timestep 3.9s, obstacle 20052 is showing the highest risk. While the distance between ego and obstacle 20052 is still significant, the recent change in acceleration of obstacle 20052 (-0.4579) suggests a rapid deceleration. This deceleration, combined with the ego vehicle's continued movement forward, could lead to a dangerous situation in the coming seconds.  Further observation is needed to ascertain the true level of risk, but it is currently evaluated as high. Obstacle 20044 does not present a risk as it is moving away from the ego vehicle on a different lanelet.
