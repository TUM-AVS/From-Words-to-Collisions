### Brief Analysis

Focusing on the most recent timestep at 3.9 seconds, we analyze the positions and velocities of the Ego vehicle and surrounding obstacles:

- **Obstacle 20052.0**:
  - At 3.9 seconds, it is still in the same lanelet (3428.0) as the Ego vehicle and has a velocity of 11.9257 m/s. 
  - The position indicates it is moving in roughly the same direction as the ego but at a higher speed.
  - Calculating TTC (Time To Collision) based on relative velocity and separation, it is decreasing in range, requiring close attention.
  - However, there is currently no immediate collision as the obstacle’s path is parallel with the Ego.

- **Obstacle 20044.0**:
  - At 3.9 seconds, this obstacle is moving towards the ego vehicle but is currently in a different lanelet (3429.0).
  - With a velocity of 12.455 m/s and substantial distance from the ego, it doesn’t pose an immediate threat.
  - Continuous monitoring is suggested, but due to being in a different lane, the risk remains low.

Despite potential for risk escalation from **Obstacle 20052.0**, there is no immediate or extreme collision risk at this time. Hence:

```json
{
    "CollisionObstacles": [],
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null,
    "HighRiskObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "20052.0",
        "OverallRiskScore": 2
    }
}
```

- Since neither obstacle directly threatens a collision from available data, realistic preemptive measures prioritize monitoring and scaling back risk through adjusted velocity and route predictions.
