### Analysis:

1. **Obstacle 20052.0**:
   - **Position**: At 3.9s, the obstacle is at (54.2405, -85.1689), while the ego is at (49.4198, -86.7612).
   - **Relative Motion**: The obstacle is ahead of the ego in the same lanelet (3428.0). The ego is decelerating (velocity decreasing), while the obstacle is also decelerating but at a higher speed (11.9257 m/s vs. ego's 4.6959 m/s).
   - **TTC**: The longitudinal distance is ~4.82m, and the relative velocity is ~7.23 m/s (obstacle is moving faster but decelerating). TTC ≈ 4.82 / 7.23 ≈ 0.67s. This is very short, indicating **Extreme Risk (1)**.
   - **Lateral Distance**: The lateral distance is small (same lanelet), so the risk is high.

2. **Obstacle 20044.0**:
   - **Position**: At 3.9s, the obstacle is at (22.1925, -87.7072), while the ego is at (49.4198, -86.7612).
   - **Relative Motion**: The obstacle is in a different lanelet (3429.0) and is moving away from the ego's path. The lateral distance is large, and the trajectories are diverging.
   - **Risk**: **Negligible (5)**.
