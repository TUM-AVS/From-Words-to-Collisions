At timestep 3.9s, Obstacle 20052 is showing the highest risk. It's in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle and is rapidly decelerating (-0.4579 m/sÂ²) while the ego vehicle maintains a relatively constant velocity.  The distance between the two is decreasing, and the sudden deceleration of Obstacle 20052 suggests a potential emergency braking situation or other anomaly. This creates a high risk of collision if the ego vehicle does not react accordingly. Obstacle 20044 is in a different lane and poses no immediate threat.
