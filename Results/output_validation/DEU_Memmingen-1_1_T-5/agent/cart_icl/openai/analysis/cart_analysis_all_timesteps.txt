In the given scenario, I will analyze the risk levels by evaluating the distance and trajectory of each obstacle relative to the Ego vehicle across the 10 timesteps, focusing particularly on the most recent data at 3.9 seconds. 

1. Evaluate Obstacle 20052.0 at 3.9 seconds:
   - **Position**: (54.2405, -85.1689) relative to Ego's position (49.4198, -86.7612).
   - **Distance to Ego**: Approximately 5.21 meters.
   - **Velocity**: 11.9257 m/s (approaching the Ego).
   - **TTC (Time to Collision)**: Assuming direct approach with minimal lateral movement, with the current distance and closing speed, TTC is very short.
   - **Lanelet**: Same as Ego, indicating a higher risk of collision if on a converging course.
   - **Risk Assessment**: Given the decreasing distance and aligned lanelet, the risk is assessed as **Extreme (1)**.

2. Evaluate Obstacle 20044.0 at 3.9 seconds:
   - **Position**: (22.1925, -87.7072) relative to Ego's position (49.4198, -86.7612).
   - **Distance to Ego**: Approximately 27.32 meters.
   - **Velocity**: 12.455 m/s.
   - **Lanelet**: Different from Ego (lanelet 3429), and appears to be moving perpendicular or away.
   - **Risk Assessment**: Given the distance and lateral lanelet difference, the risk is **Negligible (5)**.

Analyzed risks:

- **Obstacle 20052.0** is assessed with an **Extreme Risk (1)** due to close proximity, high speed, and same lane positioning. Immediate action is required to prevent collision.

No other obstacles present a significant immediate risk based on the provided data. Below is the structured JSON output summarizing the highest risk posed by the obstacles.
