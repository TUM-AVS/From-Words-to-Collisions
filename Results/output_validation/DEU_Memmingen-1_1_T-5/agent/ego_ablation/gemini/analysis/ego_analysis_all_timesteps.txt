At time 3.9 seconds, Obstacle 20052 is behind the ego vehicle with a longitudinal distance of -0.57 meters and a lateral distance of 0.00 meters.  The relative longitudinal velocity is 7.23 m/s, indicating it is closing in rapidly.  Given the minimal distance and positive relative velocity, a collision is imminent.

Obstacle 20044 is in the front-right of the ego with distances of 21.69 meters longitudinally and -5.86 meters laterally. The relative velocity is -9.56 m/s longitudinally (moving away) and 11.47 m/s laterally (moving towards the ego). While there's lateral movement towards the ego, the large longitudinal distance and negative longitudinal velocity suggest sufficient time to react and a low risk of collision with Obstacle 20044 in this time step.
