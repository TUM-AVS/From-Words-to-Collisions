Obstacle 20044 is in the Front-right of the ego vehicle, with a longitudinal distance of 21.69 meters and a lateral distance of -5.86 meters.  The relative longitudinal velocity is -9.56 m/s (meaning it's approaching the ego vehicle) and the lateral velocity is 11.47 m/s (moving towards the ego vehicle from the right). While the obstacle is moving towards the ego vehicle both longitudinally and laterally, the distances and relative velocities don't suggest an immediate collision. Therefore, it's not classified as a high risk or extreme risk at this timestep. It's likely a medium risk, but further analysis with more future timesteps are needed.

Obstacle 20052 is behind the ego vehicle, at a longitudinal distance of -0.57 meters. The relative longitudinal velocity is 7.23 m/s, indicating it's rapidly approaching the ego vehicle. Given the very small longitudinal distance and high closing velocity, this obstacle poses an extreme risk of collision in the next timestep. Therefore, it's assigned a risk score of 1 (Extreme Risk).

Risk Levels:
0: Collision - Physical contact occurred or unavoidable
1: Extreme Risk - Immediate collision likely
2: High Risk - Close to collision, needs quick action
3: Medium Risk - Manageable with proper reaction
4: Low Risk - Minimal risk, sufficient time to react
5: Negligible Risk - No significant risk
