### Safety analysis for timestep 3.9s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

**Calculations and Assumptions:**

Since the provided context lacks vehicle dimensions, I'll assume a car length of 4 meters and width of 2 meters for both ego and obstacle vehicles.  I will use these dimensions to adjust longitudinal and lateral distances, effectively representing the distances between the vehicle boundaries rather than center points. Because the obstacles are diagonal to the ego vehicle, we must use vector calculations to accurately assess TTC.

**Adjusted Distance Calculations:**

* **Obstacle 20052:**
    * `adjusted_d_long` =  abs(-0.57) - 4 = -3.43m (The negative sign indicates the obstacle is behind)
    * `adjusted_d_lat` = abs(-0.57) - 2 = -1.43m (The negative sign indicates the obstacle is to the left and back of the ego vehicle)
* **Obstacle 20044:**
    * `adjusted_d_long` = 21.69 - 4 = 17.69m
    * `adjusted_d_lat` = 21.69 - 2 = 19.69m


**TTC Calculations:**

* **Obstacle 20052:**
    * Given the very short distance and negative relative longitudinal distance and the closing velocity, a collision is imminent in the next timestep (0.1s). TTC will be approximately 0.07 seconds.
* **Obstacle 20044:**  While individually, both longitudinal and lateral relative velocities seem concerning given the distances, the obstacle is moving at an angle relative to the ego vehicle.  Thus, a simple linear TTC calculation isn't accurate. We need to analyze it in vector space to estimate the true TTC. The relative motion and distances suggest that obstacle 20044 poses no immediate risk of collision in the next timestep. TTC > 5 seconds.

**MDC Calculations:**

* **Obstacle 20052:** MDC is approximately 0 meters in the next time step as a collision is predicted.
* **Obstacle 20044:** MDC is greater than 5 meters given the relative distances and trajectories.


### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID:** 20052
- **Distance Risk reason:** `adjusted_d_long` and `adjusted_d_lat` are extremely small and negative, placing the obstacle very close behind and slightly to the left of the ego, indicating an extremely high risk of collision.
- **Distance safety score:** 0
- **Time Risk reason:**  TTC is less than 0.1 seconds, indicating imminent collision.
- **Time safety score:** 0
- **Overall Risk score:** 0 (Imminent Collision)

- **Obstacle ID:** 20044
- **Distance Risk reason:** `adjusted_d_long` and `adjusted_d_lat` are large and positive, indicating a safe distance.
- **Distance safety score:** 5
- **Time Risk reason:** TTC is greater than 5 seconds, indicating no immediate risk of collision.
- **Time safety score:** 5
- **Overall Risk score:** 5
