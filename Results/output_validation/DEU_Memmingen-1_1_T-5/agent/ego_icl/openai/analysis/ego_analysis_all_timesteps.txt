Given the scenario, the focus is on analyzing the most recent timestep at 3.9 seconds. Let’s review the data for the identified obstacles:

### Obstacle 20052 Analysis:
- At 3.9 seconds, Obstacle 20052 is directly behind the ego car with an adjusted longitudinal distance of -0.57 m and exact lateral alignment (0.00 m). This implies a direct trajectory towards the ego vehicle.
- Relative velocity is 7.23 m/s towards the ego car, indicating a closing motion.
- Longitudinal acceleration has increased to 0.42 m/s², further suggesting a potential for imminent collision.
- **Trajectory Analysis**: Over the previous timesteps (3.0 to 3.8), the longitudinal distance decreased progressively from -7.07 m to -0.57 m, confirming a rapidly closing gap.
- **Time-to-Collision (TTC)**:
  - Longitudinal Distance / Relative Velocity = 0.57 m / 7.23 m/s ≈ 0.08 seconds
- **Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC) is already almost zero**, indicating that the collision is imminent.

### Obstacle 20044 Analysis:
- At 3.9 seconds, Obstacle 20044 is located at the front-right with an adjusted longitudinal distance of 21.69 m and lateral distance of -5.86 m.
- The relative velocity towards the ego car is -9.56 m/s longitudinally and 11.47 m/s laterally, indicating an approach from the front-right.
- **Trajectory Analysis**: From 3.7 to 3.9 seconds, the obstacle has shown a consistent approach both longitudinally and laterally.
- **Time-to-Collision (TTC)**:
  - Longitudinal Distance / |Longitudinal Velocity| = 21.69 m / 9.56 m/s ≈ 2.27 seconds
- **MDC**: As both longitudinal and lateral distances are non-zero and approaching, MDC remains contextual to their intersection but appears to be more substantial than 1 meter at present calculations, primarily based on longitudinal data.

### Risk Assessment:
- For **Obstacle 20052**, the TTC of 0.08 seconds and near-zero MDC indicate an imminent collision at extremely high risk.
- For **Obstacle 20044**, with a TTC of 2.27 seconds and greater approaching distances, it is assessed as a medium risk due to sufficient time for potential evasion or slowing measures.

### Final JSON Summary:
```json
{
    "CollisionObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "20052",
        "OverallRiskScore": "0"
    },
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "20052",
