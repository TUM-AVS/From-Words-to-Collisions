At t=4.1s, Ego is at (48.5252, -87.0472) in lanelet 3428. Obstacle 20052 is at (51.9865, -85.9204) also in lanelet 3428.  Obstacle 20044 is at (24.1341, -89.7635) in lanelet 3429.

Obstacle 20052: This obstacle is in the same lane as Ego and closing rapidly. Though not colliding at t=4.1s, the trajectories suggest a very high probability of collision in the next few timesteps if both vehicles maintain their current course and velocity.  Given the rate of closure, there is little time to react. Risk score = 1 (Extreme Risk).

Obstacle 20044: While this obstacle is in a different lanelet, it's crucial to consider lane changes and potential interactions. At this moment, there's no imminent danger of collision. Risk score = 4 (Low Risk).
