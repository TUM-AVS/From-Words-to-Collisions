At t=4.1s, Ego (20050.0) is at (48.5252, -87.0472) in lanelet 3428.0.

Obstacle 20052.0 is at (51.9865, -85.9204) also in lanelet 3428.0.  The distance between Ego and Obstacle 20052.0 is decreasing over the observed time steps, and their positions at t=4.1s suggest a high risk of collision. Although Obstacle 20052.0 is braking harder now, the closing speed and proximity warrant an extreme risk assessment.

Obstacle 20044.0 is at (24.1341, -89.7635) in lanelet 3429.0. This obstacle appears to be on a different lanelet and poses no immediate threat.
