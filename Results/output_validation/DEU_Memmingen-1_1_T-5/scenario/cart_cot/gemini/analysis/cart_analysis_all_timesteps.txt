### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 20044.0
- Distance Risk reason: At the most recent timestep (4.1s), Obstacle 20044.0 is located in a different lanelet (3429.0) than the Ego vehicle (3428.0). Examining the trajectory history, we observe that this obstacle was not present until 3.7 seconds.  While its lateral position is somewhat close to the ego vehicle, the different lanelets suggest a low immediate risk.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Obstacle 20044.0 has a higher velocity than the ego vehicle and is accelerating. While this could be a concern if it were to change lanes, it is currently in a separate lanelet.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- Obstacle ID: 20052.0
- Distance Risk reason:  At the most recent timestep (4.1s), Obstacle 20052.0 is in the same lanelet as the Ego vehicle. The distance between them has been steadily decreasing over the observed time period. At 4.1s, the obstacle is significantly closer than it was at 3.2s.
- Distance safety score: 2
- Time Risk reason: While the obstacle's velocity is higher than the ego vehicle's, both vehicles' speeds are reducing, and the relative velocity is closing.  The history shows a consistent trend of the obstacle approaching the ego vehicle. The obstacle's negative acceleration indicates braking, but it's not clear if this is sufficient to avoid a collision given the decreasing inter-vehicle distance.
- Time safety score: 2
- Overall Risk score: 2

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. **Most critical obstacle:** Obstacle 20052.0 poses the most immediate risk as it shares the same lanelet as the ego vehicle and is rapidly approaching. While Obstacle 20044.0 is nearby, it's in a different lanelet, posing less immediate risk.
2. **Trajectory analysis:** Obstacle 20052.0's trajectory shows a consistent movement towards the ego vehicle within the same lane, with the distance between them decreasing over time. Obstacle 20044.0 appears from 3.7s onwards in a separate lane, initially far away but getting progressively closer to the ego vehicle.
3. **Relative positions, velocities, and accelerations:**  Obstacle 20052.0 has a higher velocity than the ego vehicle, although both vehicles' speeds are decreasing. The obstacle's negative acceleration indicates braking, but this is not guaranteed to prevent a collision given the proximity. Obstacle 20044.0's position in a different lane makes its velocity and acceleration less critical at this point.
4. **Collision determination:**  A collision is not observed in the given timesteps, but there is a high likelihood of an imminent collision with Obstacle 20052.0 given the current trend.
5. **Reasoning:** The combination of decreasing distance,  closing relative velocity, and same-lane occupancy leads to the conclusion that a collision with Obstacle 20052.0 is highly probable unless significant evasive action is taken.

  "CollisionObstacles": null,

  },
  "ScenarioAnalysis": {
    "IsCollisionScenario": false,
    "Reasoning": "While no collision has occurred within the provided 1-second timeframe, Obstacle 20052.0 presents a high risk due to its continuous approach towards the ego vehicle within the same lane, and a closing relative velocity. The negative acceleration of the obstacle indicates braking, but it's unclear if this is sufficient to avoid a collision given the current trajectory.  A collision is highly probable in the near future unless evasive maneuvers are executed."
