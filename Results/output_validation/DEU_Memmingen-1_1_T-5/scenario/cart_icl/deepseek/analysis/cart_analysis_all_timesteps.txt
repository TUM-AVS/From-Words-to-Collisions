### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. **Obstacle 20052.0** is in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle and is approaching rapidly (velocity=11.8341). The distance is very small (Y=-85.5454 vs ego Y=-87.0472), indicating an imminent collision.
2. Other obstacles are either static, moving away, or in different lanelets, posing no immediate threat.
3. The ego vehicle is decelerating (acceleration=-0.0112), but not enough to avoid collision with Obstacle 20052.0.
