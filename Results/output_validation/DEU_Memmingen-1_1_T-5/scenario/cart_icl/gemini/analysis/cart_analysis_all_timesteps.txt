### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 20044.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 20044.0 is in a different lanelet and poses no immediate risk.  Its trajectory over the past several timesteps indicates it is moving away from the ego vehicle's lane.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: The relative velocities and trajectories suggest no time-based risk of collision.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 20052.0
- Distance Risk reason: While in the same lane, obstacle 20052.0 is ahead of the ego vehicle and maintaining a safe distance.  Previous timesteps show increasing separation.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Relative velocities and decelerations of both vehicles indicate a decreasing risk of collision over time.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4


### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
This is not a collision scenario. No obstacle is on a collision course with the ego vehicle. Obstacle 20052 is in the same lane but moving ahead and away from the ego vehicle.  Obstacle 20044 is in a different lane and moving away.
