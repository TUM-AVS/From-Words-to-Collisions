### Obstacle Analysis at 4.1 seconds:

#### Obstacle 20044.0:
- **Distance Risk reason**: Obstacle 20044.0 is in a different lanelet (3429.0) and there is no immediate intersection with the ego lanelet at 3428.0. Its trajectory shows movement away from the Ego vehicle.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: Relative velocity and trajectory indicate the obstacle is not on a collision path with the Ego vehicle, moving significantly away both longitudinally and laterally.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

#### Obstacle 20052.0:
- **Distance Risk reason**: Obstacle 20052.0 and the Ego vehicle are in the same lanelet (3428.0) and relatively close at 4.1 seconds. Based on historical data, the trajectory is predominantly parallel but maintaining a consistent gap.
- **Distance safety score**: 3
- **Time Risk reason**: The obstacle maintains a higher velocity, slightly decelerating, but it's not converging into a path that intersects with the Ego vehicle. There is a consistent velocity trend and parallel movement.
- **Time safety score**: 3
- **Overall Risk score**: 3

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. **Identification**: Obstacle 20052.0 is in the same lanelet as the Ego vehicle.
2. **Trajectory Analysis**: Both Ego and Obstacle 20052.0 maintain their respective paths with a stable distance.
3. **Calculations and Risk**: Although Obstacle 20052.0 shows moderate risk due to parallel movement in the same lane and potential for closing distance, the trajectory and velocity trends suggest it is manageable.
4. **Conclusion**: Given the evaluated metrics, there is neither a collision scenario nor an extreme risk with any obstacle.
