### Obstacle-by-Obstacle Analysis (Most Recent Timestep: 4.1s)

#### **Obstacle 20044 (Front-Right)**  
- **Adjusted Position**: Longitudinal 19.56m, Lateral -3.18m  
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal -11.32 m/s (approaching), Lateral 10.75 m/s (approaching from right)  
- **Motion**: Driving toward ego both longitudinally and laterally from the right.  

**Risk Assessment**:  
1. **Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC)**:  
   - Lateral distance is 3.18m (Low Risk, 4)  
   - Longitudinal distance is 19.56m (No Risk, 5)  
   - **MDC = 3.18m (Low Risk, 4)**  

2. **Time-to-Collision (TTC)**:  
   - **Longitudinal TTC** = 19.56 / 11.32 ≈ **1.73s (Medium Risk, 3)**  
   - **Lateral TTC** = 3.18 / 10.75 ≈ **0.30s (Extreme Risk, 1)**  
   - **Final TTC = 0.30s (Extreme Risk, 1)**  

3. **Overall Risk**:  
   - **Extreme Risk (1)** due to low lateral TTC (0.30s).

#### **Obstacle 20052 (Collision)**  
- **Adjusted Position**: Longitudinal 0.00m, Lateral 0.00m  
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal 7.14 m/s (still moving forward), Lateral 0.17 m/s (minimal drift).  
- **Motion**: Already in collision state (both distances = 0.00m).  

**Risk Assessment**:  
1. **Collision (0)** confirmed by zero distance in both dimensions.

### Trajectory Analysis  
- **Obstacle 20052**:  
  - From 3.2s to 4.1s, it rapidly closed the longitudinal gap (from -5.64m to 0.00m) with high relative velocity (~7.2 m/s).  
  - Collision occurred at **4.0s** and persists at **4.1s**.  

- **Obstacle 20044**:  
  - Laterally closing fast (TTC = 0.30s), but still 3.18m away.  
  - Longitudinal distance decreasing but remains large (19.56m).  

---

### Final Determination  
- **Collision Scenario** due to **Obstacle 20052** (collision confirmed at 4.0s and 4.1s).  
- **Obstacle 20044** poses **Extreme Risk (1)** but has not yet collided.
