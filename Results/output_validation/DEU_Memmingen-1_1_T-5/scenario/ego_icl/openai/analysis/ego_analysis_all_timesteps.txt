## Obstacle-by-Obstacle Analysis

### Obstacle 20052
#### Trajectory Analysis:
- **3.2s to 4.1s**: This obstacle is persistently approaching the ego vehicle from behind with reducing longitudinal distance, demonstrating a continuous trajectory toward the ego vehicle in the same lane.
- **From 3.2s to 4.0s**, the longitudinal distance decreased from -5.64m to 0.00m, indicating the obstacle is moving rapidly towards the ego vehicle with a relatively consistent converging velocity.
- **Relative Velocity (3.9s-4.0s)**: Longitudinal direction velocity is 7.19 m/s approaching with minimal lateral change at 0.12 m/s.

#### Risk Assessment at 4.1s (Most Recent Timestep):
- **Adjusted Distances and Motion**:
  - **Longitudinal Distance**: 0.00 meters
  - **Lateral Distance**: 0.00 meters
  - **Motion**: Exact longitudinal and lateral alignment indicates the obstacle is fully aligned with the ego vehicle with no separation.
  
- **Risk Metrics**:
  - **MDC**: 0.00 meters
  - **TTC**: Given the longitudinal velocity of 7.14 m/s approaching and the longitudinal distance of 0.00m, a collision is occurring.

- **Risk Score**: 0 (Collision)
  
### Obstacle 20044
#### Trajectory Analysis:
- **At 4.1s**, this vehicle is on the front-right of the ego vehicle, with its path indicating a diagonally converging trajectory toward the ego vehicle.
- **Distances from 3.7 to 4.1 seconds**: Longitudinal distance reduces from 23.35m to 19.56m and lateral distance reduces from -8.67m to -3.18m indicating a closing pattern.
- **Relative Velocities**: Longitudinal velocity is -11.32 m/s (approaching), and lateral velocity is 10.75 m/s indicating lateral converging from the right.
  
#### Risk Assessment at 4.1s:
- **Adjusted Distances**:
  - **Longitudinal Distance**: 19.56 meters
  - **Lateral Distance**: -3.18 meters

- **Risk Metrics**:
  - **MDC**: Given the closing patterns, particularly rapid lateral closing, the smallest dimensions pose the risk.
  - **TTC**: With substantial longitudinal distance and velocities involved, the time to collision is sufficiently beyond immediate risk.

- **Risk Score**: 4 (Low Risk, primarily due to relatively greater distance and converging velocities)

## Conclusion:
- The most recent analysis clearly indicates that Obstacle 20052 is in a collision scenario with the ego vehicle with a complete convergence in both longitudinal and lateral dimensions.
- Obstacle 20044 is assessed with a low risk due to existing separation and time to significant collision.
