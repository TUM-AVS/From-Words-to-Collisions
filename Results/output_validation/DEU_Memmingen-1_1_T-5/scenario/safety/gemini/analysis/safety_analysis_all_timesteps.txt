### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 20044
- Relative Direction: Front-right
- Distance Risk Reason:  The obstacle is at a safe longitudinal distance (19.56m, LongDSC = 5), and the lateral distance is moderately close (3.18m, LatDSC = 3) but decreasing over time. The obstacle's trajectory suggests it might pass ahead of the ego vehicle.
- Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 5
- Lateral Distance Safety Score: 3
- Overall Distance Safety Score: 4.0 (5 * 0.5 + 3 * 0.5 = 4.0)
- Time Risk Reason:  Longitudinal TTC is safe (1.73s, LongTSC = 3). Lateral TTC is moderate (0.30s, LatTSC = 1), indicating some lateral risk if the current trajectory continues.
- Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 3
- Lateral Time Safety Score: 1
- Overall Time Safety Score: 2.0 (3 * 0.5 + 1 * 0.5 = 2.0)
- Overall Risk Score: 3 (0.5 * 4.0 + 0.5 * 2.0 = 3.0)

- Obstacle ID: 20052
- Relative Direction: Behind
- Distance Risk Reason: The obstacle has collided with the ego vehicle (0.00m longitudinal and lateral distance). Previous timesteps show a consistent decrease in longitudinal distance, leading to the collision.
- Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 0
- Lateral Distance Safety Score: 0
- Overall Distance Safety Score: 0.0 (0 * 1.0 + 0 * (1-1.0) = 0)
- Time Risk Reason: Both longitudinal and lateral TTC are 0.00, indicating a collision has occurred, as confirmed by the distance metrics and previous timesteps.
- Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 0
- Lateral Time Safety Score: 0
- Overall Time Safety Score: 0.0 (0 * 1.0 + 0 * (1-1.0) = 0.0)
- Overall Risk Score: 0 (0.5 * 0.0 + 0.5 * 0.0 = 0.0)
