Here's the collision risk analysis:

**Obstacle 311:** This obstacle is in a different lanelet (5852/5853) than the ego vehicle (4507) and their y-coordinates are diverging, indicating no immediate collision risk.  Although its x-coordinate suggests proximity, the differing lanelets and diverging paths reduce the risk. Risk score: 5 (Negligible Risk)

**Obstacle 315:** This obstacle is in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle (4507). While it is behind the ego vehicle initially, its velocity and acceleration are higher than the ego's, suggesting it's catching up. The y-coordinates are converging slightly, indicating a potential risk if this trend continues and the ego decelerates more aggressively. The increasing difference in velocity should be noted. Risk score: 3 (Medium Risk)

**Obstacle 324:** This obstacle appears at 0.7 seconds and remains in lanelet 5791.  It is far from the ego vehicle and maintains a very low velocity. It poses no immediate threat. Risk score: 5 (Negligible Risk).

**Obstacle 331:**  This obstacle is in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle (4507).  It's located behind the ego vehicle and its velocity is lower. While the ego vehicle is decelerating, it's not doing so at a rate that suggests an imminent collision with this obstacle in the short term. Risk score: 4 (Low Risk)
