Obstacle 311: This obstacle is in a different lanelet (5852/5853) than the ego vehicle (4507) and their y-positions are diverging, indicating they are moving further apart.  Although 311's x-position is approaching the ego vehicle's, the different lanelets suggest a different roadway, so collision is unlikely. Risk score: 5 (Negligible Risk).

Obstacle 315: This obstacle is in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle (4507). While its x-position is close to the ego vehicle, its y-position is consistently behind the ego, and the ego vehicle is decelerating while Obstacle 315 is accelerating. It appears Obstacle 315 will overtake Ego but given current trajectories, this is unlikely to result in a collision in the near future. Risk Score 4 (Low Risk).


Obstacle 324: This obstacle appears at 0.7 seconds and remains present. Its lanelet (5791) differs from the ego vehicle's (4507) and its position is quite far from the ego vehicle. Furthermore, its velocity is very low. Therefore, it poses no immediate threat. Risk score: 5 (Negligible Risk).

Obstacle 331: This obstacle is in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle (4507). Its y-position is significantly behind the ego vehicle and its velocity is less than ego's but it is accelerating at a faster rate. It will likely overtake ego. Risk Score 4 (Low Risk).
