Obstacle 315 is showing concerning behavior. It is in the same lane as the ego vehicle and its longitudinal velocity is increasing relative to the ego vehicle, indicating potential for a rear-end collision if the ego vehicle decelerates or the obstacle continues to accelerate.  Obstacle 331 is also in the same lane as the ego vehicle but further behind, and it's also accelerating, although not as aggressively as 315.  Obstacle 311 is in a different lane and moving away from the ego vehicle, posing negligible risk. Obstacle 324 is also far and presents negligible risk.

Focusing on the most recent timestamp (1.0 second):
- **Obstacle 315**:  Requires close monitoring due to its proximity, higher speed, and acceleration in the same lane as the ego vehicle. Although a collision is not imminent in the next few seconds, the relative motion trends warrant a medium risk level as preventative action may soon be required.
- **Obstacle 331**: Poses less risk than 315 due to greater longitudinal separation, but requires monitoring due to its acceleration.
- **Obstacle 311**:  No immediate risk due to different lane and divergent trajectories.
- **Obstacle 324**: No immediate risk due to distance and slow speed.
