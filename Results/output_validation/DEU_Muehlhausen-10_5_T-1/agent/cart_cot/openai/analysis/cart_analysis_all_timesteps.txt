### Analysis

1. **Obstacle 311.0:**
   - Observation: It is moving significantly faster than the ego vehicle and has progressively increased its velocity over the timesteps. It changes lanelets from 5852.0 to 5853.0.
   - Risk Assessment: As it is in a different lanelet and moving away from the ego vehicle in terms of lateral distance, the risk remains low.

2. **Obstacle 315.0:**
   - Observation: Shares the same lanelet as the ego vehicle (4507.0) and is accelerating with a higher velocity than the ego vehicle, potentially leading to a rear-end situation.
   - Risk Assessment: Due to being in the same lanelet and its increasing velocity, it poses a high risk of collision if no adjustments are made. Needs urgent attention to avoid collision.
   
3. **Obstacle 324.0:**
   - Observation: Has a very low velocity and different lanelet. It poses negligible risk, as its movement is minimal.
   - Risk Assessment: Negligible risk due to minimal motion and being in a different lanelet.

4. **Obstacle 331.0:**
   - Observation: Moving slower compared to obstacle 315.0 but still in the same lanelet as the ego. The velocity is gradually increasing but remains less threatening immediately.
   - Risk Assessment: Medium risk due to being in the same lanelet with a manageable relative velocity to the ego vehicle. Can be managed with system or driver response.
