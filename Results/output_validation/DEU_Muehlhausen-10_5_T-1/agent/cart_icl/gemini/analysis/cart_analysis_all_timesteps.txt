Obstacle 315 is in the same lane as the ego vehicle and is closing in relatively fast.  At the last timestep (1.0s), obstacle 315 is approximately 27 meters ahead of the ego vehicle, but the relative velocity suggests a potential collision if the ego vehicle brakes and obstacle 315 does not.

Obstacle 331 is also in the same lane as the ego vehicle and is behind the ego vehicle. Its distance is increasing from the ego vehicle across the timesteps and poses no immediate risk.

Obstacle 311 is in a different lanelet and its trajectory does not intersect with the ego vehicle's path.

Obstacle 324 is also in a different lanelet and far from the ego vehicle with minimal relative velocity. It presents negligible risk.
