### Analysis:

Let's first observe the trends in position, velocity, and trajectory of each obstacle relative to the ego vehicle over the final few timesteps leading up to 1.0 seconds.

#### Obstacle 311:
- At 1.0s, positions are (-488.618, 143.18169).
- Has maintained a high speed and significant acceleration, moving away from the ego vehicle's trajectory.
- The separation increases along with the different lanelet positions from the ego, indicating minimal collision proximity.
- **Risk Assessment**: Low as it is in a different lanelet and diverging path.

#### Obstacle 315:
- At 1.0s, positions are (-495.2273, 118.49599) and in lanelet 4507, same as the ego.
- Trajectory and speed suggest closing in with the ego vehicle despite the relative position since the same lanelet indicates potential interaction.
- Approach angle and speed are concerning as the relative separation is minimal in terms of the lanelet, but the paths do not cross.
- **Risk Assessment**: Medium due to trajectory in same lanelet and closing proximity.

#### Obstacle 331:
- At 1.0s, positions are (-497.75705, 99.780481) and in lanelet 4507.
- Moving at a steady close proximity speed, appears to trail behind in the same lanelet.
- While it is in the same lanelet, it does not exhibit a direct collide vector since it is trailing.
- **Risk Assessment**: Medium but manageable.

#### Obstacle 324:
- Very low velocity and acceleration, essentially stationary concerning others.
- Located at (-484.91094, 149.69967) with no overlap in direct pathing with the ego vehicle.
- **Risk Assessment**: Negligible due to position and inert movement.

### Conclusion:

From the analysis above, Obstacle 315 poses a median risk due to its same lanelet place but lack of immediate collision vector. Obstacle 311, despite speed, remains in a separate trajectory/path, mitigating its immediate threats.

### Output JSON:

```json
{
    "CollisionObstacles": [],
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {},
    "HighRiskObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "315",
        "OverallRiskScore": 2
    }
}
```

This output identifies Obstacle 315 as the highest risk factor due to its proximity and speed in the same lanelet context, even though a direct collision isn't immediate. All others are considered lower risk due to separate pathing and different operational spaces.
