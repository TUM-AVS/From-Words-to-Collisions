At t=1.0s:

* **Obstacle 311:** Located front-right, moving away longitudinally (15.68m) and laterally (-1.64m). No immediate risk. Risk score: 5 (Negligible Risk).
* **Obstacle 315:** Located behind, rapidly approaching (-0.65m) longitudinally at 3.43 m/s.  This is very close and represents a high risk of collision if the ego vehicle were to brake suddenly or reverse. Risk score: 2 (High Risk).
* **Obstacle 324:** Located front-right (22.64m longitudinal, -4.44m lateral), approaching longitudinally but moving away laterally.  No immediate risk. Risk score: 4 (Low Risk).
* **Obstacle 331:** Located behind (-19.53m), approaching longitudinally at 1.57 m/s.  Given the distance and relative velocity, this obstacle doesn't pose an immediate threat. Risk score: 3 (Medium Risk)


Risk Levels:
0: Collision - Physical contact occurred or unavoidable
1: Extreme Risk - Immediate collision likely
2: High Risk - Close to collision, needs quick action
3: Medium Risk - Manageable with proper reaction
4: Low Risk - Minimal risk, sufficient time to react
5: Negligible Risk - No significant risk
