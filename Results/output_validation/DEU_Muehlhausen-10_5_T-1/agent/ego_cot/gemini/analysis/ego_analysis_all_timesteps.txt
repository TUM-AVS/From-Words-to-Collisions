### Safety analysis for timestep 1.0s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

**Assumptions and Clarifications:**

* Since adjusted distances (adjusted_d_long, adjusted_d_lat) are not provided in the scenario context, I will use the provided real distances (DTClong, DTClat) for calculations.  However, in a real-world application, using adjusted distances is crucial for accurate risk assessment.
* I will calculate TTC (Time to Collision) based on the provided relative velocities and distances.  Since constant velocity is assumed for TTC calculation and the scenario provides acceleration data, the TTC values represent an approximation. More sophisticated TTC calculations would consider the relative acceleration.
* I am assuming a vehicle width and length of 2 meters for illustrative purposes in determining risk from lateral distances.  Real-world applications would use the actual vehicle dimensions.

**Calculations and Reasoning:**

* **Obstacle 311:** This obstacle is in the Front-right and moving away both longitudinally and laterally.  It poses no immediate risk.
    * *Distance Risk:* DTClong = 15.68m, DTClat = 15.68m. This substantial distance translates to a negligible risk.  Score: 5
    * *Time Risk:* Based on the current trajectory, the obstacle is moving away, so TTC is theoretically infinite.  Score: 5
    * *Overall Risk Score:* 5

* **Obstacle 315:** This obstacle is Behind and approaching the ego vehicle longitudinally (DTClong = -0.65m, closing).  This is extremely dangerous.
    * *Distance Risk:* DTClong = -0.65m. Being less than 1m behind poses an extreme risk. Score: 1
    * *Time Risk:* Vrel_long = 3.43 m/s. TTClong = 0.65/3.43 ≈ 0.19s.  This very short TTC indicates extreme risk. Score: 1
    * *Overall Risk Score:* 1 (Extreme Risk)

* **Obstacle 324:** This obstacle is in the Front-right and approaching the ego vehicle longitudinally (DTClong = 22.64m, closing) and laterally (though slowly).  There is some risk, but it's not immediate.
    * *Distance Risk:* DTClong = 22.64m, DTClat = 22.64m. This large distance poses low risk. Score: 5
    * *Time Risk:*  Longitudinal velocity is -5.97 m/s meaning is moving towards the ego vehicle. TTClong = 22.64/5.97 ≈ 3.8s. This provides ample time to react.  Lateral velocity is 0.34m/s.  TTClat = 22.64/0.34 ≈ 66.6s, posing no immediate lateral risk. Score: 3
    * *Overall Risk Score:* 3 (Medium Risk)

* **Obstacle 331:** This obstacle is Behind and approaching the ego vehicle (DTClong = -19.53m, closing), but it is relatively far.  There is low risk at present
    * *Distance Risk:* DTClong = -19.53m, DTClat = -19.53m.  Relatively far, therefore low risk. Score 4
    * *Time Risk:* Longitudinal velocity is 1.57m/s. TTClong = 19.53/1.57 ≈ 12.4s. Ample time to react.  Score: 5
    * *Overall Risk Score:* 4 (Low Risk)
