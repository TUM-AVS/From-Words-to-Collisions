Let me analyze each obstacle at the most recent timestep (1.0 seconds) and assess collision risks:

1. Obstacle 311 (Front-right):
- Longitudinal distance: 15.68m (moving away at 3.38m/s)
- Lateral distance: -1.64m (moving away at -6.79m/s)
- Both distances increasing â†’ No collision risk
- TTC: N/A (diverging paths)
- MDC: >5m in both dimensions
- Risk: 5 (Negligible)

2. Obstacle 315 (Behind):
- Longitudinal distance: -0.65m (approaching at 3.43m/s)
- Lateral distance: 0.00m (stable)
- Closing rapidly from behind
- TTC: 0.65m / 3.43m/s = 0.19s (Extreme Risk)
- MDC: 0.65m (High Risk)
- Risk: 1 (Extreme) - Prioritize lower score

3. Obstacle 324 (Front-right):
- Longitudinal distance: 22.64m (approaching at -5.97m/s)
- Lateral distance: -4.44m (approaching at 0.34m/s)
- Primary risk is longitudinal
- TTC: 22.64m / 5.97m/s = 3.79s (Low Risk)
- MDC: >5m
- Risk: 4 (Low)

4. Obstacle 331 (Behind):
- Longitudinal distance: -19.53m (approaching at 1.57m/s)
- Lateral distance: 0.00m (stable)
- Closing slowly from far behind
- TTC: 19.53m / 1.57m/s = 12.44s (No Risk)
- MDC: >5m
- Risk: 5 (Negligible)

Trajectory Analysis:
- Obstacle 315 is the most critical, closing rapidly from behind with TTC of 0.19s
- Other obstacles either moving away or at safe distances
- No current collision (risk 0) but imminent extreme risk from Obstacle 315
