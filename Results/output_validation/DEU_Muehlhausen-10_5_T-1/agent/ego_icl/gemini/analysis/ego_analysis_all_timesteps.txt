* **Obstacle 311 (Front-Right):** This obstacle is moving away from the ego vehicle both longitudinally and laterally. The longitudinal distance is increasing, and the lateral distance is also increasing (becoming more negative, indicating movement to the right).  There is no risk of collision.
    * TTC (longitudinal): 15.68m / 3.38 m/s ≈ 4.64s (Low Risk)
    * TTC (lateral): Not applicable as obstacle is moving away laterally.
    * MDC: Approximately 15.68m (Low Risk)
    * Overall Risk: 4 (Low Risk)

* **Obstacle 315 (Behind):** This obstacle is approaching the ego vehicle from behind and is very close. The longitudinal distance is -0.65m, indicating it is very close behind the ego vehicle. Given the closing velocity of 3.43 m/s, a collision is imminent.
    * TTC (longitudinal): 0.65m / 3.43 m/s ≈ 0.19s (Extreme Risk)
    * MDC: Approximately 0.65m (High Risk)
    * Overall Risk: 1 (Extreme Risk)

* **Obstacle 324 (Front-Right):** This obstacle is approaching longitudinally and slightly laterally but is still relatively far. 
    * TTC (longitudinal): 22.64m / 5.97 m/s ≈ 3.79s (Low Risk)
    * TTC (lateral): Not applicable, very small lateral velocity and distance is not critical
    * MDC: Approximately 22.64m (Low Risk)
    * Overall Risk: 4 (Low Risk)

* **Obstacle 331 (Behind):**  This obstacle is approaching the ego vehicle from behind.
    * TTC (longitudinal): 19.53m / 1.57 m/s ≈ 12.44s (Negligible Risk)
    * MDC: Approximately 19.53m (Low Risk)
    * Overall Risk: 5 (Negligible Risk)
