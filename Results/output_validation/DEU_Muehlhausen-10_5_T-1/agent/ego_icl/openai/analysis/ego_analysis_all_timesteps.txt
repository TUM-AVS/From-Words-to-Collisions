Based on the latest timestep (1.0 seconds), we need to assess the risk of collision with all identified obstacles using the adjusted longitudinal and lateral distances, relative velocities, and associated motion descriptions:

### Analysis for Obstacle 311:
- **Position and Motion**:
  - Front-right of ego vehicle
  - Adjusted longitudinal distance: 15.68 m
  - Adjusted lateral distance: -1.64 m
  - Relative velocity: longitudinal 3.38 m/s, lateral -6.79 m/s
  - The obstacle is moving away longitudinally and laterally to the right.
  
- **Risk Assessment**:
  - Longitudinal direction: The obstacle is moving away, increasing the distance.
  - Lateral direction: Although the obstacle is laterally aligned, it's moving away swiftly.
  - **Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC)**: Based on trajectory and distances, MDC is large (> 5.0 m).
  - **Time-to-Collision (TTC)**: Since it is moving away in both directions, TTC is not applicable for collision.
  - **Risk Level**: Low Risk (5)

### Analysis for Obstacle 315:
- **Position and Motion**:
  - Behind the ego vehicle
  - Adjusted longitudinal distance: -0.65 m
  - Adjusted lateral distance: 0.00 m
  - Relative velocity: longitudinal 3.43 m/s, lateral -0.04 m/s
  - The obstacle is driving toward the ego vehicle from behind.

- **Risk Assessment**:
  - Longitudinal direction: Rapidly closing in from behind, close alignment.
  - **MDC**: The longitudinal distance is nearing zero quickly, indicating an immediate issue.
  - **TTC**: Approximately TTC = |Adjusted longitudinal distance / Relative velocity| = |0.65 / 3.43| ≈ 0.19 seconds.
  - **Risk Level**: Extreme Risk (1)

### Analysis for Obstacle 324:
- **Position and Motion**:
  - Front-right of ego vehicle
  - Adjusted longitudinal distance: 22.64 m
  - Adjusted lateral distance: -4.44 m
  - Relative velocity: longitudinal -5.97 m/s, lateral 0.34 m/s
  - The obstacle is driving toward the ego vehicle longitudinally and laterally.

- **Risk Assessment**:
  - Longitudinal direction: Distance decreasing at a significant rate.
  - Lateral direction: Slight alignment but not considerable at convergence rate.
  - **MDC**: Trajectory does not intersect closely.
  - **TTC Longitudinal**: |22.64 / 5.97| ≈ 3.79 seconds.
  - **TTC Lateral**: Not applicable for collision (moving away laterally).
  - **Risk Level**: Medium Risk (3)

### Analysis for Obstacle 331:
- **Position and Motion**:
  - Behind the ego vehicle
  - Adjusted longitudinal distance: -19.53 m
  - Adjusted lateral distance: 0.00 m
  - Relative velocity: longitudinal 1.57 m/s, lateral 0.00 m/s
  - The obstacle is driving toward the ego vehicle from behind.

- **Risk Assessment**:
  - Longitudinal direction: Positive relative velocity but large separation and rate of closing is low.
  - **MDC**: Large; hence minimal risk of collision.
  - **TTC**: Long due to larger distance and low speed.
  - **Risk Level**: Low Risk (4)

Based on this detailed evaluation, here is the risk prediction in JSON format:

```json
{
    "CollisionObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "",
        "OverallRiskScore": ""
    },
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "315",
        "OverallRiskScore": "1"
    },
    "HighRiskObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "",
        "OverallRiskScore": ""
    }
}
```

### Summary:
- **Obstacle 315** poses an Extreme Risk due to its close and rapidly closing position towards the ego vehicle.
- **No Collision or High Risk objections** were identified based on the recent timestep analysis.
