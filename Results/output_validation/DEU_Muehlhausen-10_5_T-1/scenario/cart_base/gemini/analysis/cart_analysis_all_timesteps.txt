At t=1.2s, Ego is in lanelet 4507.0 at (-494.3806, 124.7629).

* Obstacle 311.0 is in lanelet 5853.0 at (-486.82254, 144.67152).  While the y-coordinate difference suggests some lateral separation, the lanelets likely indicate different roads or at least separate directions of travel.  This obstacle poses no immediate risk.

* Obstacle 315.0 is in the same lanelet as Ego (4507.0) at (-494.96711, 120.37122).  It is traveling faster than Ego (9.65 vs 5.58 m/s) and is behind Ego. The x-coordinates are very close, but 315 is slightly further behind than it was in the previous timesteps, meaning the risk is decreasing. This is a low to medium risk, definitely not extreme.

* Obstacle 324.0 is in lanelet 5791.0 at (-484.98532, 149.67999). It is almost stationary and laterally separated from Ego.  No immediate risk.

* Obstacle 331.0 is in the same lanelet as Ego (4507.0) at (-497.55772, 101.26525). It is traveling faster than Ego (7.59 vs 5.58 m/s) but is behind Ego and has consistently been behind it in the previous timesteps as well. The distance between them in previous timesteps has shown a general increase, meaning that collision is less likely in the immediate future. Risk is low.
