### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. **Lanelet Analysis**: Ego is in lanelet 4507.0. Obstacles 315, 331, and 341 are in the same lanelet.
2. **Trajectory Analysis**: Obstacles 315 and 331 are behind ego but closing distance, but not at an extreme rate.
3. **Velocity/Acceleration**: No obstacles are on a direct collision course with extreme closing speeds.
4. **Risk Assessment**: No immediate collision or extreme risk detected. Medium risk for obstacles 315 and 331 due to same lanelet and closing distance.
