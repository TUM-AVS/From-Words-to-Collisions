### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 311.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 311.0 is in a different lanelet and moving away from the ego vehicle.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason:  The relative velocity and trajectories indicate no risk of collision.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 315.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 315.0 is in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle, but further ahead and moving faster.  The distance between them is increasing.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: The relative velocity and acceleration suggest a low probability of collision in the near future.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- Obstacle ID: 324.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 324.0 is in a different lanelet and far from the ego vehicle.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Obstacle 324.0 has very low velocity and poses no immediate threat.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 331.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 331.0 is in the same lanelet and behind the ego vehicle, but moving faster.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason:  While 331.0 is accelerating, the current trajectories suggest sufficient time for the ego vehicle to react or for 331.0 to change lanes if necessary.  
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3


### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
At the most recent timestep (1.2s), no obstacle poses an immediate collision risk. Obstacle 315.0 is ahead and moving faster, increasing the gap. Obstacle 331.0 is behind and accelerating, but the distance is still sufficient. Obstacle 311.0 and 324.0 are located in different lanelets and pose no risk.  Therefore, this is not a collision scenario.
