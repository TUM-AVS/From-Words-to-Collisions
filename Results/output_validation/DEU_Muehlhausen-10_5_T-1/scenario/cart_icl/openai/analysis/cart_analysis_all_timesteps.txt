### Safety Analysis for the Most Recent Timestep:

### Obstacle Analysis:

#### Obstacle ID: 311
- **Distance Risk Reason**: Obstacle 311 is moving away from the ego vehicle on a different lanelet, consistently increasing the distance with high velocity and positive acceleration. It is not in the path of the ego vehicle.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 5
- **Time Risk Reason**: Given the trajectory and acceleration, Obstacle 311 continues increasing its relative distance. Velocity and acceleration trends show it is diverging from the ego's position.
- **Time Safety Score**: 5
- **Overall Risk Score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 315
- **Distance Risk Reason**: Obstacle 315 shares a lanelet with the ego vehicle and is moving closer over time, but it remains a safe distance away, slightly increasing separation at the most recent timestep.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 4
- **Time Risk Reason**: The previous acceleration and velocity patterns show 315 maintaining and slightly increasing a safe distance from the ego. 
- **Time Safety Score**: 4
- **Overall Risk Score**: 4

#### Obstacle ID: 324
- **Distance Risk Reason**: The obstacle is moving on a different lanelet with minimal velocity, posing no immediate threat. The distance between it and the ego vehicle remains significant.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 5
- **Time Risk Reason**: The velocity and minimal acceleration of this obstacle make it virtually stationary relative to the ego vehicle.
- **Time Safety Score**: 5
- **Overall Risk Score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 331
- **Distance Risk Reason**: Obstacle 331, over past timesteps, stays consistently ahead without crossing paths with the ego vehicle, showing no signs of convergence.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 5
- **Time Risk Reason**: It maintains a trajectory parallel to the ego vehicle, thus not posing a time-based collision threat.
- **Time Safety Score**: 5
- **Overall Risk Score**: 5

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. **Collision Evaluation**: None of the obstacles are on a collision course based on their trajectory and distance.
2. **Risk Evaluation**: No obstacle shows a trajectory that converges with the ego vehicle, exhibiting low risk levels.
3. **Conclusion**: With no obstacle presenting a collision or extreme risk, this scenario does not imply an immediate collision risk.
