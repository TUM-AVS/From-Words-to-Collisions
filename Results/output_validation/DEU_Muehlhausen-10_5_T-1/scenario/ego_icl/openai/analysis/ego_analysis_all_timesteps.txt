## Obstacle-by-Obstacle Analysis

### Obstacle 311 (Front-Right)
1. **Adjusted Distances (Most Recent Timestep at 1.2s):**
   - Longitudinal: 16.23 m
   - Lateral: -3.22 m

2. **Velocities:**
   - Longitudinal: 2.31 m/s (away)
   - Lateral: -8.88 m/s (moving away to the right)

3. **Trajectory Analysis:**
   - Moving laterally away from the ego vehicle.
   - The longitudinal distance is increasing, with the obstacle moving further right over time.

4. **TTC and MDC:**
   - TTC for longitudinal is not applicable due to both increased distance and moving away velocity.
   - MDC calculation shows the obstacle is moving away both longitudinally and laterally.

5. **Risk Assessment:**
   - Longitudinal and lateral moving away, effectively lowering risk.
   - Assigned Risk Score: 5 (No Risk)

### Obstacle 315 (Collision)
1. **Adjusted Distances (Most Recent Timestep at 1.2s):**
   - Longitudinal: 0.00 m
   - Lateral: 0.00 m

2. **Velocities:**
   - Longitudinal: 4.07 m/s (approaching)

3. **Trajectory Analysis:**
   - Approaching the ego car directly from behind.
   - Exact alignment in both dimensions (longitudinal and lateral), indicating either a collision or nearly at collision point.

4. **TTC and MDC:**
   - Immediate collision is occurring.
   - TTC is effectively zero due to zero distance.

5. **Risk Assessment:**
   - Both dimensions at zero distance with the vehicle aligning directly indicate collision.
   - Assigned Risk Score: 0 (Collision)

### Obstacle 324 (Front-Right)
1. **Adjusted Distances (Most Recent Timestep at 1.2s):**
   - Longitudinal: 21.44 m
   - Lateral: -4.37 m

2. **Velocities:**
   - Longitudinal: -5.74 m/s (approaching)
   - Lateral: 0.38 m/s (slight movement to left)

3. **Trajectory Analysis:**
   - The longitudinal distance is closing as the obstacle approaches the ego car.
   - Slight lateral movement towards the ego car but the distance is quite large.

4. **TTC and MDC:**
   - TTC calculation shows significant time remains due to the large distance: approximately 3.74s longitudinally.
   - MDC remains above 5.0 meters, indicating paths will unlikely intersect soon.

5. **Risk Assessment:**
   - Although approaching, the current distances and relative velocities do not indicate immediate threat.
   - Assigned Risk Score: 4 (Low Risk)

### Obstacle 331 (Behind)
1. **Adjusted Distances (Most Recent Timestep at 1.2s):**
   - Longitudinal: -19.20 m (behind)
   - Lateral: 0.00 m

2. **Velocities:**
   - Longitudinal: 2.01 m/s (approaching)

3. **Trajectory Analysis:**
   - Moving toward the ego vehicle, but from a significant distance.
   - Consistent alignment with approaching velocity but relatively longer distance suggests lower immediate risk despite closing in.

4. **TTC and MDC:**
   - TTC for longitudinal component is approximately 9.55s.
   - MDC remains greater than 5.0 meters due to longer-distance projection needed for close alignment.

5. **Risk Assessment:**
   - Current closing speed suggests future monitoring but does not indicate imminent collision.
   - Assigned Risk Score: 5 (No Risk)

## Conclusion: Collision Scenario

- **Identified Collision:** Obstacle 315 is in a collision state by being directly aligned in both dimensions with the ego car, indicating an immediate collision scenario.

- **Overall Scenario Evaluation:** Given that Obstacle 315 is conclusively in contact with the ego car, this scenario is definitively identified as a collision scenario.
