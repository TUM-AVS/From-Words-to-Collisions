### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 311
- Relative Direction: Front-right
- Distance Risk Reason: Obstacle 311 is moving away from the ego vehicle both longitudinally and laterally. It started as Front and shifted to Front-right, consistently increasing DTClong and moving DTClat further negative.
- Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 5
- Lateral Distance Safety Score: 5
- Overall Distance Safety Score: 5.0
- Time Risk Reason: Both TTClong and TTClat are inf, indicating no collision risk. This has been consistent across previous timesteps.
- Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 5
- Lateral Time Safety Score: 5
- Overall Time Safety Score: 5.0
- Overall Risk Score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 315
- Relative Direction: Collision
- Distance Risk Reason:  DTClong and DTClat are both 0 indicating a collision. The obstacle has been approaching from behind throughout all timesteps, with DTClong decreasing steadily.
- Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 0
- Lateral Distance Safety Score: 0
- Overall Distance Safety Score: 0.0
- Time Risk Reason: TTClong and TTClat are both 0, confirming the collision. TTClong has been decreasing consistently in previous timesteps.
- Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 0
- Lateral Time Safety Score: 0
- Overall Time Safety Score: 0.0
- Overall Risk Score: 0

- Obstacle ID: 324
- Relative Direction: Front-right
- Distance Risk Reason: The obstacle is relatively far longitudinally (DTClong > 5) and moderately far laterally (3 < DTClat < 5).  Over previous timesteps, it has slightly decreased DTClong, becoming a potential longitudinal concern.
- Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 5
- Lateral Distance Safety Score: 4
- Overall Distance Safety Score: 4.5
- Time Risk Reason: TTClong is approximately 3.74 which is 3<TTClong<5, therefore LongTSC is 4, and TTClat is over 5, indicating no immediate lateral risk. TTClat is decreasing from previous timesteps.
- Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 4
- Lateral Time Safety Score: 5
- Overall Time Safety Score: 4.5
- Overall Risk Score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 331
- Relative Direction: Behind
- Distance Risk Reason: The obstacle is far behind the ego vehicle (DTClong < -5). It was initially moving away but started approaching in later timesteps.
- Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 5
- Lateral Distance Safety Score: 0
- Overall Distance Safety Score: 5.0
- Time Risk Reason: TTClong is approximately 9.57, indicating no immediate longitudinal collision risk. TTClat is 0 as the vehicles are almost in the same lateral line.
- Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 5
- Lateral Time Safety Score: 0
- Overall Time Safety Score: 5.0
- Overall Risk Score: 5
