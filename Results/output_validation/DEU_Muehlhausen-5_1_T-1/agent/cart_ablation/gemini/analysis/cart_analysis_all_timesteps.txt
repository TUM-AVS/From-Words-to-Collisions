Here's the collision risk analysis:

**Obstacle 31:** This obstacle is stationary and far from the ego vehicle's trajectory.  It poses no immediate risk. *Risk Score: 5*

**Obstacle 34:** This obstacle is moving but its trajectory does not intersect with the ego vehicle's path in the observed time frame. The distance between them suggests no imminent collision risk. *Risk Score: 4*

**Obstacle 330:** This obstacle is in the same lane as the ego vehicle and moving in the same direction. While it's initially behind the ego vehicle, its speed is significantly higher than the ego vehicle. It is accelerating heavily and closing in on the ego vehicle throughout the given time steps. If this trend continues, it is highly likely to cause a collision within the near future.  Hence, it is considered high risk. *Risk Score: 2*

**Obstacle 341:** This obstacle is also in the same lane and moving in the same direction as the ego vehicle. The distance between the ego and obstacle is decreasing, suggesting that if this trend continues, it is very likely to collide with the ego vehicle soon.  Hence it is considered an extreme risk. *Risk Score: 1*

**Obstacle 365:**  This obstacle is moving but its trajectory does not intersect with the ego vehicle and is on a different lanelet. The distance and relative velocities do not indicate any immediate risk in the short-term future. *Risk Score: 5*
