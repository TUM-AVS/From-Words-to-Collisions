Obstacle 31: Stationary and far from the ego vehicle's trajectory. Negligible risk.

Obstacle 34: Moving in a different lanelet and diverging from the ego vehicle. Low risk.

Obstacle 330: In the same lanelet as the ego vehicle and moving faster.  While its x-position is getting closer to the ego vehicle, it remains ahead and its y-position is close, but doesn't appear to be converging rapidly enough to pose an immediate threat within the predicted timeframe. Medium risk.

Obstacle 341:  In the same lanelet as the ego vehicle and moving slower than the ego vehicle.  The ego vehicle is approaching obstacle 341 and they are in the same lanelet. High risk.

Obstacle 365: Moving in a different lanelet and diverging from the ego vehicle's trajectory. Low risk.
