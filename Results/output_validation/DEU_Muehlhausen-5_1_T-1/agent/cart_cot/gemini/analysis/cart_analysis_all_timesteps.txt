Obstacle 330 shows concerning behavior. It is in the same lane as the ego vehicle and rapidly accelerating towards it.  While a collision is not imminent in the next second, the current trend suggests a high risk of collision if both vehicles maintain their course and velocity. Obstacle 341 is also in the same lane and accelerating, but poses less of an immediate risk than 330.
