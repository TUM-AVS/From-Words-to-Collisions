### Brief Analysis:

In the final timestep at 1.1 seconds, we need to analyze the relative positions, velocities, and trends to determine risks for the ego vehicle from each obstacle.

1. **Obstacle 31**: Stationary, far away from the ego vehicle, presents negligible risk.
2. **Obstacle 34**: Moving away laterally from the ego's path, poses negligible risk.
3. **Obstacle 330**: Closest to the ego vehicle in terms of trajectory, with significant velocity and acceleration in the same lanelet since 0.2 seconds. However, the gap is widening due to increased acceleration, reducing immediate collision potential but maintained significant velocity that previously threatened the ego vehicle.
4. **Obstacle 341**: Shares the lanelet with the ego and though increasing speed, the spacing and lateral offset likely minimize collision risk in the immediate future.
5. **Obstacle 365**: Fast-moving and primarily laterally offset, its trajectory diverges, removing immediate collision prospects.

### Explanation:

- **Collision Obstacle 330**: Overall, it's the fastest ascending speed and acceleration among adjacent vehicles but currently trends indicate a lessened risk.
- **Extreme Risk Mark for 330**: While diminished within this specific timestep, the previously elevated risk it held might be a concern if trends shift.
- **High Risk Obstacle 341**: Shares lanelet with ego vehicle, yet manageable separation in motion trends needs attention without immediate collision concerns.
