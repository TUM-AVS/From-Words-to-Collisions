Obstacle 330 is in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle and rapidly approaching from behind.  Its speed is significantly higher than the ego vehicle's, and the distance between them is decreasing in each timestep. This presents a high risk of collision if the ego vehicle does not react or if obstacle 330 continues to accelerate.

Obstacle 341 is also in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle and approaching from behind, though not as rapidly as obstacle 330. Its speed is higher than the ego vehicle's. This presents a medium risk, which needs to be monitored closely.

Obstacle 34 shows a consistent lateral distance to the ego vehicle, with a slight decrease in the y-coordinate difference. Given the opposing headings, the vehicles might cross paths. Risk level medium, requires monitoring.

Obstacle 31 is stationary and poses no immediate threat.

Obstacle 365 is not in the same lane as the ego vehicle, and although its heading varies significantly across timesteps, the lateral distance suggests no immediate danger.
