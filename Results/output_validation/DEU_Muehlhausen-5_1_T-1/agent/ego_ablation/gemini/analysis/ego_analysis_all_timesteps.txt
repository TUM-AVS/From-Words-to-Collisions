At t=1.1s, Obstacle 330 poses an extreme risk of collision.

* **Obstacle 31:**  Located 11.44m longitudinally and 21.78m laterally (front-left), moving towards the ego vehicle longitudinally at -2.5 m/s.  Given the distance and lateral movement, the risk is assessed as low (4).
* **Obstacle 34:** Located 15.1m longitudinally and 0m laterally (front), moving towards the ego vehicle at -2.52 m/s longitudinally and 2.32 m/s laterally.  While moving closer longitudinally, the lateral velocity suggests it might be changing lanes. Risk is assessed as medium (3) due to the lateral movement and some distance.
* **Obstacle 330:** Located -0.55m longitudinally and 0m laterally (behind), and moving towards the ego vehicle at 3.44 m/s. This close proximity and relative velocity indicate an *extreme risk* of collision (1).  The MDC is < 0.5m and TTC is very low as well.
* **Obstacle 341:** Located -12.18m longitudinally and 0m laterally (behind), moving at 0.74 m/s towards the ego vehicle. Though moving closer, the distance is sufficient to consider the risk low (4).
* **Obstacle 365:**  Located 19.32m longitudinally and 5.96m laterally (front-left), moving towards the ego vehicle at -5.72 m/s longitudinally but away laterally at 3.6 m/s. Risk is assessed as low (4) considering the distances and lateral movement away.
