Obstacle 31: This obstacle is in the front-left and approaching the ego vehicle longitudinally, but it maintains a safe lateral distance (21.78 m) and poses no immediate threat. Risk score: 4.

Obstacle 34:  This obstacle is in front of the ego vehicle and closing in longitudinally (-2.52 m/s). However, its lateral movement (2.32 m/s) suggests it might be changing lanes and not on a direct collision course. Risk score: 3.

Obstacle 330: This obstacle is behind the ego vehicle and very close (-0.55 m). Its longitudinal relative velocity (3.44 m/s) indicates it is rapidly approaching. This is potentially dangerous and requires attention.  Risk score: 2.

Obstacle 341: Although behind the ego vehicle, this obstacle is now driving towards the ego car with a relative longitudinal velocity of 0.74 m/s.  While the distance is not immediately concerning (-12.18 m), its motion warrants monitoring. Risk score: 3.

Obstacle 365: This obstacle is in the front-left and approaching longitudinally while moving away laterally. It is not a direct threat. Risk score: 4.

Risk Levels:
0: Collision - Physical contact occurred or unavoidable
1: Extreme Risk - Immediate collision likely
2: High Risk - Close to collision, needs quick action
3: Medium Risk - Manageable with proper reaction
4: Low Risk - Minimal risk, sufficient time to react
5: Negligible Risk - No significant risk
