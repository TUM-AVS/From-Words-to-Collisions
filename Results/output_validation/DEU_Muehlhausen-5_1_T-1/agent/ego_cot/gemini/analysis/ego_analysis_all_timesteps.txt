### Safety analysis for timestep 1.1s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

**- Obstacle ID: 31**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 31 is in the Front-left of the ego vehicle at a longitudinal and lateral distance of 11.44m.  This distance represents a safe separation.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason:  With a closing velocity of -2.50 m/s longitudinally and no lateral velocity, the TTC is greater than 5 seconds.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

**- Obstacle ID: 34**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 34 is in front of the ego vehicle at a longitudinal and lateral distance of 15.10m. This represents a safe separation.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: While approaching longitudinally at -2.52 m/s, the lateral motion of 2.32 m/s suggests it's likely passing and won't collide. The TTC is still greater than 5 seconds.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

**- Obstacle ID: 330**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 330 is behind the ego vehicle and very close longitudinally (-0.55m). Although behind, this proximity presents a high risk.
- Distance safety score: 2
- Time Risk reason: The positive relative longitudinal velocity (3.44 m/s) shows that Obstacle 330 is moving towards the ego vehicle from behind. The calculated TTC is extremely short which represents a high risk of collision.
- Time safety score: 2
- Overall Risk score: 2

**- Obstacle ID: 341**
- Distance Risk reason:  Obstacle 341 is behind the ego vehicle at longitudinal and lateral distances of -12.18m, posing no immediate risk.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Although the longitudinal relative velocity is 0.74 m/s (closing), the distance is large enough to result in a large TTC, hence low risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

**- Obstacle ID: 365**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 365 is in the Front-left with 19.32m longitudinal and lateral distance, indicating a safe separation.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: The longitudinal closing velocity (-5.72 m/s) is significant, but the lateral velocity (3.60 m/s) indicates a divergent path, reducing the collision risk. The overall TTC is greater than 5 seconds.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5
