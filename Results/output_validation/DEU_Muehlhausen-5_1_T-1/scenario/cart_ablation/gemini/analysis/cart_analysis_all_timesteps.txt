At t=1.3s, Ego is at (-272.6163, 101.0309) with a velocity of 2.5015. Let's analyze the closest obstacles:

* **Obstacle 34:** Position (-291.76353, 102.41576).  While moderately close in the y-coordinate, the x-coordinate difference suggests a longitudinal separation that is likely safe given the current velocities. This obstacle is moving slower than Ego, reducing the risk of collision in the short term. Risk score: 3 (Medium Risk).

* **Obstacle 330:** Position (-268.34959, 100.19312). This obstacle is fairly close to the ego vehicle and traveling significantly faster. The converging trajectories and speed differential present a high risk. Risk score: 2 (High risk).

* **Obstacle 341:** Position (-256.46569, 97.563066).  This obstacle poses no immediate threat.  Risk score: 4 (Low Risk)

* **Obstacle 365:** Position (-296.45551, 96.728811).  This obstacle is also moving in a direction unlikely to lead to an immediate collision. Risk score: 3 (Medium Risk)

* **Obstacle 31:** Position (-291.84826, 80.634496). Stationary and far from Ego. Risk score: 5 (Negligible Risk)

* **Obstacle 36:** Position (-287.73419, 126.61533). Relatively slow-moving and poses no immediate risk. Risk score: 4 (Low Risk)


Based on the provided data at t=1.3s, no obstacle presents a collision or extreme risk scenario.

```json
{
  "CollisionObstacles": [],
  "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null,
  "ScenarioAnalysis": {
    "IsCollisionScenario": false,
    "Reasoning": "No obstacle is on a collision course with Ego within the predicted timeframe at t=1.3s. Obstacles 330 and 34 present the highest risk, categorized as high (2) and medium (3) respectively, requiring monitoring and potential evasive action."
