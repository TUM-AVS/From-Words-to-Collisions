At t=1.3s, Ego is at (-272.6163, 101.0309) in lanelet 5937. Let's analyze the latest positions and trajectories of the obstacles:

* **Obstacle 31:** Stationary and far from Ego's lanelet. Negligible risk.
* **Obstacle 34:** Moving in lanelet 6329, but the y-coordinate difference with Ego and its trajectory indicate no immediate risk. Low risk.
* **Obstacle 36:**  In lanelet 4696, with a significant y-coordinate difference from Ego.  Low risk.
* **Obstacle 330:** In lanelet 4633. While the y-coordinates are close, obstacle 330 is moving forward (increasing x) faster than Ego, and the trajectories suggest diverging paths.  Medium Risk.
* **Obstacle 341:** Also in lanelet 4633, and behind 330. Its trajectory follows 330, suggesting a similar diverging path from Ego. Medium Risk.
* **Obstacle 365:** In lanelet 6023 with a similar y-coordinate to Ego.  However, it's moving in the opposite direction (decreasing x) and the lanelet information suggests it's unlikely to intersect Ego's path. Low risk.
