### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 31.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is far from ego and stationary. No risk.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Obstacle is stationary, posing no immediate time-related risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 34.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is laterally separated and moving away from ego.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason:  Relative motion suggests decreasing risk over time.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- Obstacle ID: 36.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is laterally separated and far from ego.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Slow velocity and large lateral separation minimizes time-related risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5


- Obstacle ID: 330.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is behind and in the same lane, but moving faster than ego.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Although in the same lane, the increasing relative velocity suggests the obstacle is pulling away.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- Obstacle ID: 341.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is behind and in the same lane, but moving faster than ego.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Similar to 330, increasing relative velocity suggests decreasing risk.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4


- Obstacle ID: 365.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is laterally separated and moving away from ego.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason:  The trajectory and velocity suggest decreasing risk over time.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4



### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
No obstacle poses an immediate collision risk at the last timestep. All obstacles are either moving away from the ego vehicle or are sufficiently separated to not present a danger in the near future, based on their current trajectories. This is not a collision scenario.
