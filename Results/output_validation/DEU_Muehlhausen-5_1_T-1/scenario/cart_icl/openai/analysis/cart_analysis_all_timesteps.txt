### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep:

### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 31**
  - **Distance Risk reason:** Stationary obstacle far from the ego path, no significant changes in position or orientation.
  - **Distance safety score:** 5
  - **Time Risk reason:** No change in velocity or acceleration over time, maintained a far distance from the ego vehicle.
  - **Time safety score:** 5
  - **Overall Risk score:** 5

- **Obstacle ID: 34**
  - **Distance Risk reason:** Positioned on the periphery of ego's trajectory but maintaining a safe parallel path.
  - **Distance safety score:** 4
  - **Time Risk reason:** Consistent acceleration pattern, not intersecting with ego's path.
  - **Time safety score:** 4
  - **Overall Risk score:** 4

- **Obstacle ID: 36**
  - **Distance Risk reason:** Newly appeared, far off the trajectory and lanelet of the ego vehicle.
  - **Distance safety score:** 5
  - **Time Risk reason:** Low velocity and acceleration; pattern indicates no threat to the ego vehicle.
  - **Time safety score:** 5
  - **Overall Risk score:** 5

- **Obstacle ID: 330**
  - **Distance Risk reason:** Continuously moving closer to the ego vehicle's trajectory with relatively high velocity.
  - **Distance safety score:** 3
  - **Time Risk reason:** Increasing velocity suggests two vehicles might approach closer in the future.
  - **Time safety score:** 3
  - **Overall Risk score:** 3

- **Obstacle ID: 341**
  - **Distance Risk reason:** Moving closer within a shared lanelet trajectory, increasing the collision potential.
  - **Distance safety score:** 3
  - **Time Risk reason:** Faster acceleration than ego, indicating a moderate collision risk.
  - **Time safety score:** 3
  - **Overall Risk score:** 3

- **Obstacle ID: 365**
  - **Distance Risk reason:** Parallel trajectory but the velocity is slightly reducing; distance maintained across time.
  - **Distance safety score:** 4
  - **Time Risk reason:** Moderate velocity indicates controlled movement with no signs of trajectory crossing.
  - **Time safety score:** 4
  - **Overall Risk score:** 4

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
The scenario does not indicate an immediate collision. The analysis shows all obstacles either maintain a safe distance or are on a parallel path relative to the ego vehicle. Based on trajectory trends and positions, none are at immediate risk of collision.
