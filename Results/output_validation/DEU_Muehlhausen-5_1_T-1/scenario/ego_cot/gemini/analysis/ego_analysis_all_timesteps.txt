### Safety analysis for timestep 0.4s - 1.3s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

**Methodology:**

1. **TTC Calculation:** TTC = Distance / Relative Velocity.  A negative TTC indicates the objects are moving away from each other or are stationary relative to one another.  If relative velocity is zero and distance is non-zero, TTC is considered infinite (no collision likely). If both relative velocity and distance are close to zero, TTC calculation becomes unstable and requires careful consideration based on the motion description.

2. **MDC Calculation:** In this analysis, MDC is estimated based on the provided distances at different time steps and the relative motion information. We observe the trend of distance change to approximate the minimum distance.


**Obstacle Analysis:**

**Timesteps 0.4s to 1.2s:**

- **Obstacle 31:**
    - Distance Risk reason:  >11m front-left and moving slowly towards the ego vehicle.
    - Distance safety score: 4
    - Time Risk reason: Constant lateral motion; approaching longitudinally, but TTC is relatively high.
    - Time safety score: 4
    - Overall Risk score: 4

- **Obstacle 34:**
    - Distance Risk reason:  >14m front and moving towards the ego vehicle.
    - Distance safety score: 4
    - Time Risk reason: Moving slightly towards ego longitudinally and laterally.
    - Time safety score: 4
    - Overall Risk score: 4

- **Obstacle 330:**
    - Distance Risk reason: Starting behind the ego vehicle and approaching rapidly.
    - Distance safety score: From 4 (at 0.4s) decreasing to 1 (at 1.2s).
    - Time Risk reason: Negative distance indicates a vehicle behind.  Rapid approach toward zero suggests extreme risk.
    - Time safety score: From 4 decreasing to 1.
    - Overall Risk score:  From 4 decreasing to 1.

- **Obstacle 341:**
    - Distance Risk reason: Behind the ego vehicle and moderately far. Initially moving away and then moving towards ego vehicle.
    - Distance safety score: 4
    - Time Risk reason: Initially moving away, but later approaches the ego vehicle.
    - Time safety score: 4
    - Overall Risk score: 4


- **Obstacle 365:**
    - Distance Risk reason: >18m front-left and moving towards the ego vehicle longitudinally, but away laterally.
    - Distance safety score: 4
    - Time Risk reason: The lateral movement reduces risk.
    - Time safety score: 4
    - Overall Risk score: 4

- **Obstacle 36 (appears at 1.2s):**
    - Distance Risk reason: >15m front-right and moving towards the ego vehicle.
