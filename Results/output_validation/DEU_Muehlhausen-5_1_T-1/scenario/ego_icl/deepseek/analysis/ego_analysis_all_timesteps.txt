Let me analyze the most recent timestep (1.3 seconds) and assess collision risks:

Obstacle-by-obstacle analysis:

1. Obstacle 31 (Front-left):
   - Longitudinal distance: 11.11m (closing at -2.50m/s)
   - Lateral distance: 21.67m (stable)
   - TTC: Not applicable (lateral stable, longitudinal distance large)
   - MDC: >5m in both dimensions
   - Risk: 5 (No Risk) - Moving parallel to ego

2. Obstacle 34 (Front-left):
   - Longitudinal distance: 14.61m (closing at -2.50m/s)
   - Lateral distance: 0.17m (moving away at 2.42m/s)
   - TTC: Not applicable (moving away laterally)
   - MDC: >5m
   - Risk: 5 (No Risk) - Moving away diagonally

3. Obstacle 36 (Front-right):
   - Longitudinal distance: 14.61m (closing at -2.50m/s)
   - Lateral distance: -21.14m (approaching at 0.71m/s)
   - TTC: Lateral TTC = 21.14/0.71 ≈ 29.8s (very long)
   - MDC: >5m
   - Risk: 5 (No Risk) - Very distant approach

4. Obstacle 330 (Collision):
   - CRITICAL OBSERVATION:
     - At 1.3s: longitudinal distance = 0.00m, lateral = 0.00m
     - Relative velocity: 3.75m/s longitudinally (just collided)
     - Motion description: "Exact longitudinal alignment or co. Exact lateral alignment"
     - Previous timesteps show rapid approach from behind
   - This is an ACTUAL COLLISION (risk 0)
   - Confirmed by:
     - Zero distance in both dimensions
     - Positive closing velocity at moment of collision
     - Collision state explicitly mentioned in motion description

5. Obstacle 341 (Behind):
   - Longitudinal distance: -11.99m (approaching at 1.05m/s)
   - Lateral distance: 0.00m (stable)
   - TTC: 11.99/1.05 ≈ 11.4s (long)
   - MDC: >5m
   - Risk: 5 (No Risk) - Distant approach from behind

6. Obstacle 365 (Front-left):
   - Longitudinal distance: 18.30m (closing at -5.30m/s)
   - Lateral distance: 6.55m (moving away at 3.81m/s)
   - TTC: Not applicable (moving away diagonally)
   - MDC: >5m
   - Risk: 5 (No Risk) - Moving away diagonally

Trajectory Analysis:
- Obstacle 330 shows clear collision trajectory:
  - From 1.0s (-0.89m) to 1.2s (-0.20m) to 1.3s (0.00m)
  - Consistent closing velocity ~3.5m/s
  - Maintained perfect lateral alignment (0.00m)
  - Collision confirmed at 1.3s
