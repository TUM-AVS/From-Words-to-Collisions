Let's analyze each obstacle as outlined in your instructions and focus primarily on the most recent timestep (1.3 seconds) while using trajectory information from previous timesteps to calculate TTC and MDC.

### Obstacle Analysis

1. **Obstacle 31** - Front-left
   - Adjusted Distances: Longitudinal = 11.11m, Lateral = 21.67m
   - Relative Velocity: Longitudinal = -2.50 m/s (approaching), Lateral = -0.00 m/s
   - Longitudinal TTC = 11.11 / 2.50 = 4.44s
   - No lateral motion.
   - **Risk Assessment**: Lateral distance is large, and longitudinal TTC is above 5 seconds, which suggests No Risk.
   - **Risk Score**: 5

2. **Obstacle 34** - Front-left
   - Adjusted Distances: Longitudinal = 14.61m, Lateral = 0.17m
   - Relative Velocity: Longitudinal = -2.50 m/s, Lateral = 2.42 m/s
   - Longitudinal TTC = 14.61 / 2.50 = 5.84s
   - Lateral TTC = 0.17 / 2.42 ≈ 0.07s
   - **Risk Assessment**: The longitudinal risk is low due to TTC, but lateral TTC is extremely low indicating potential alignment risk. Overall remains a Medium Risk due to alignment concerns.
   - **Risk Score**: 3

3. **Obstacle 36** - Front-right
   - Adjusted Distances: Longitudinal = 14.61m, Lateral = -21.14m
   - Relative Velocity: Longitudinal = -2.50 m/s, Lateral = 0.71 m/s
   - Longitudinal TTC = 14.61 / 2.50 = 5.84s
   - Lateral TTC = 21.14 / 0.71 ≈ 29.76s
   - **Risk Assessment**: Given both longitudinal and lateral TTCs are well above 5 seconds with diverging paths, No Risk.
   - **Risk Score**: 5

4. **Obstacle 330** - Collision
   - Adjusted Distances: Longitudinal = 0.00m, Lateral = 0.00m
   - Relative Velocity: Longitudinal = 3.75 m/s (approaching), Lateral = -0.28 m/s
   - **Risk Assessment**: This obstacle is at zero distance in both dimensions. Although relative velocity suggests it could have passed the ego vehicle, the described collision state and zero distances indicate a collision risk.
   - **Risk Score**: 0

5. **Obstacle 341** - Behind
   - Adjusted Distances: Longitudinal = -11.99m, Lateral = 0.00m
   - Relative Velocity: Longitudinal = 1.05 m/s (approaching), Lateral = -0.19 m/s
   - Longitudinal TTC = 11.99 / 1.05 ≈ 11.42s
   - **Risk Assessment**: Obstacle is far behind with a low closing speed, resulting in No Risk.
   - **Risk Score**: 5

6. **Obstacle 365** - Front-left
   - Adjusted Distances: Longitudinal = 18.30m, Lateral = 6.55m
   - Relative Velocity: Longitudinal = -5.30 m/s, Lateral = 3.81 m/s
   - Longitudinal TTC = 18.30 / 5.30 ≈ 3.45s
   - Lateral TTC would be irrelevant as it's not crossing paths soon.
   - **Risk Assessment**: Both the longitudinal and lateral distances and velocities suggest it remains at a safe range, resulting in No Risk.
   - **Risk Score**: 5

### Collision Scenario Evaluation

Obstacle 330 signifies a direct collision scenario with both longitudinal and lateral distances at zero and converging velocities.

### Conclusion

Based on the assessment:
- Obstacle 330 indicates a direct collision, setting the scenario as a collision scenario.
