### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 31
- Relative Direction: Front-left
- Distance Risk Reason: DTClong = 11.11m suggests a medium risk, while DTClat = 21.67m indicates negligible risk. Over time, DTClong has decreased, showing the obstacle is approaching longitudinally while LatDSC remains constant since there is no lateral relative motion.
- Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 3
- Lateral Distance Safety Score: 5
- Overall Distance Safety Score: 4.0 (3 * 0.5 + 5 * 0.5)
- Time Risk Reason: TTClong = 4.44s suggests a low risk, while TTClat = inf indicates negligible risk. Over time, TTClong is decreasing.
- Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 4
- Lateral Time Safety Score: 5
- Overall Time Safety Score: 4.5 (4 * 0.5 + 5 * 0.5)
- Overall Risk Score: 4 (0.5 * 4.0 + 0.5 * 4.5 = 4.25, rounded to 4)

- Obstacle ID: 34
- Relative Direction: Front-left
- Distance Risk Reason: DTClong = 14.61m indicates a low risk and DTClat = 0.17m indicates an extreme risk. Though DTClong has been decreasing over time, it is still not immediately dangerous. However, the lateral distance shows a high risk as it's very close to the ego vehicle.
- Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 4
- Lateral Distance Safety Score: 1
- Overall Distance Safety Score: 2.5 (4 * 0.5 + 1 * 0.5)
- Time Risk Reason: TTClong = 5.84s represents a low risk and TTClat = inf implies a negligible risk. TTClong is steadily decreasing, which warrants monitoring. 
- Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 4
- Lateral Time Safety Score: 5
- Overall Time Safety Score: 4.5 (4 * 0.5 + 5 * 0.5)
- Overall Risk Score: 4 (0.5 * 2.5 + 0.5 * 4.5 = 3.5, rounded to 4)

- Obstacle ID: 36
- Relative Direction: Front-right
- Distance Risk Reason: DTClong = 14.61m represents a low risk, while DTClat = 21.14m suggests a negligible risk. Over time, DTClong is decreasing while DTClat suggests a decreasing trend but not yet risky.
- Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 4
- Lateral Distance Safety Score: 5
- Overall Distance Safety Score: 4.5 (4 * 0.5 + 5 * 0.5)
- Time Risk Reason: TTClong = 5.84s and TTClat = 29.78s both suggest negligible risks currently. However, TTClat shows a decreasing trend over time.
- Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 4
- Lateral Time Safety Score: 5
- Overall Time Safety Score: 4.5 (4 * 0.5 + 5 * 0.5)
- Overall Risk Score: 5 (0.5 * 4.5 + 0.5 * 4.5 = 4.5, rounded to 5)

- Obstacle ID: 330
- Relative Direction: Behind
- Distance Risk Reason: DTClong = 0.0m and DTClat = 0.0m indicate a collision.  DTClong has been approaching zero over multiple timesteps.
- Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 0
- Lateral Distance Safety Score: 0
- Overall Distance Safety Score: 0.0 (0 * 1 + 0 * (1-1))
- Time Risk Reason: TTClong = 0.0s and TTClat = 0.0s confirm the collision as the time to impact has reached zero.
- Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 0
- Lateral Time Safety Score: 0
- Overall Time Safety Score: 0.0 (0 * 1 + 0 * (1-1))
- Overall Risk Score: 0 (0.5 * 0.0 + 0.5 * 0.0 = 0.0, rounded to 0)

- Obstacle ID: 341
- Relative Direction: Behind
- Distance Risk Reason: DTClong = -11.99m (negative means behind) indicates a negligible risk, and DTClat = 0.0m suggests the obstacle is directly behind. The magnitude of DTClong shows it is moving slightly closer.
- Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 5
- Lateral Distance Safety Score: 0
- Overall Distance Safety Score: 5.0 (5 * 1.0 + 0 * (1-1))
- Time Risk Reason: TTClong = 11.43s indicates a negligible risk, while TTClat = 0.0s again confirms the directly-behind alignment. TTClong is initially inf, and now has some value showing the obstacle is driving toward the ego car from behind.
- Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 5
- Lateral Time Safety Score: 0
- Overall Time Safety Score: 5.0 (5 * 1 + 0 * (1-1))
- Overall Risk Score: 5 (0.5 * 5.0 + 0.5 * 5.0 = 5.0, rounded to 5)

- Obstacle ID: 365
- Relative Direction: Front-left
- Distance Risk Reason: DTClong = 18.30m and DTClat = 6.55m both suggest negligible risks currently. DTClong decreased over time showing it is getting closer, and DTClat is increasing, meaning laterally it is moving away.
- Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 5
- Lateral Distance Safety Score: 5
- Overall Distance Safety Score: 5.0 (5 * 0.5 + 5 * 0.5)
- Time Risk Reason: TTClong = 3.45s suggests a low risk, while TTClat = inf indicates a negligible risk.
- Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 4
- Lateral Time Safety Score: 5
- Overall Time Safety Score: 4.5 (4 * 0.5 + 5 * 0.5)
- Overall Risk Score: 5 (0.5 * 5.0 + 0.5 * 4.5 = 4.75, rounded to 5)
