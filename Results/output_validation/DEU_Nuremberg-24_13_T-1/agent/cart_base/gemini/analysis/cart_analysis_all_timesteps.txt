The ego vehicle (30713.0) and the obstacle (30716.0) are in different lanelets (1930.0 and 613.0, respectively).  While the provided data doesn't give us lanelet geometry, the positions and consistent orientations suggest they are on diverging paths. The obstacle is moving significantly faster than the ego vehicle. The distance between them is initially around 7.8 meters and increases over the timesteps. Although the obstacle's acceleration fluctuates, the overall trend shows the vehicles are moving apart. Therefore, there is no immediate risk of collision.
