The obstacle 30716.0 shows a decreasing trend in distance to the ego vehicle over the provided timesteps.  At the last timestep (8.2 seconds), the obstacle is at (-263.2525, -173.4804) and the ego vehicle is at (-259.696, -177.8855).  The distance between them is approximately 4.6 units.  While the obstacle's acceleration fluctuates, its velocity remains significantly higher than the ego vehicle's. This difference in velocity combined with the decreasing distance suggests a potential collision risk. Further calculations of TTC and MDC using precise trajectory predictions are recommended to accurately assess the risk.  Based on the current data, the risk level appears to be high (2 or 3).
