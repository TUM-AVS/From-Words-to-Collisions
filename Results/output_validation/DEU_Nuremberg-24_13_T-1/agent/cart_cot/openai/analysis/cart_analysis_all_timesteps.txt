Based on the latest timestep at 8.2 seconds, let's conduct the collision risk assessment. We'll evaluate the relative motion of the ego vehicle and the obstacle and calculate both TTC (time to collision) and MDC (minimum distance to collision) as necessary.

1. **Position and Speed Analysis**:
   - **Ego Vehicle**: Position = (-259.696, -177.8855), Velocity = 4.3509 (moving generally southwest).
   - **Obstacle 30716.0**: Position = (-263.2525, -173.4804), Velocity = 8.5369 (moving slightly southeast).

2. **Relative Motion**:
   - The positions indicate that the obstacle is in the same general area but on a parallel trajectory, gradually converging towards the ego vehicle.

3. **Risk Analysis**:
   - **Distance calculation**: The Euclidean distance between ego and obstacle is approximately 5.715 meters.
   - Given the velocities and orientations, both vehicles are moving in somewhat parallel lines, but the high speed of the obstacle imposes a risk.
   - **TTC**: Calculating TTC indicates that the obstacle could potentially intersect the ego vehicle's future path at high speed, given the current velocity and trajectory, in under a second.
   - **MDC**: The current minimum distance is already close and may decrease rapidly based on the current trajectory of the obstacle.

4. **Risk Level Assessment**:
   - The obstacle's higher speed, proximity, and trajectory towards the ego vehicle pose an **Extreme risk**.
   - Close in both physical distance and time, immediate evasive action by the ego or corrective by the obstacle is crucial.

Based on the above observations, obstacle 30716.0 presents a significant imminent collision risk due to its speed, orientation, and relative path.
