### Brief Analysis:
- **Obstacle 30716.0**: The obstacle is moving at a higher velocity (8.5369 m/s) compared to the ego vehicle (4.3509 m/s) and is approaching from the side. The lateral distance is decreasing over time, and the relative motion suggests a potential collision if current trajectories continue. The TTC is low, indicating imminent risk, hence the **Extreme Risk (1)** classification. No immediate collision has occurred, but urgent action is required to avoid a collision.
