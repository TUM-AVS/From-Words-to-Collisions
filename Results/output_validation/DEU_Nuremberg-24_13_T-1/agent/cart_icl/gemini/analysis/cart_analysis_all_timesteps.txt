At timestep 8.2s, obstacle 30716 is located at (-263.25, -173.48) while the ego vehicle is at (-259.69, -177.88).  The obstacle is roughly 3.56 meters ahead and 4.4 meters to the left of the ego vehicle.  The obstacle's velocity is 8.53 m/s while the ego's is 4.35 m/s. The lanelets are different meaning they likely are not on a collision course.  Over the past ten timesteps, the lateral distance has remained relatively constant, suggesting no immediate collision risk. Although the obstacle is moving considerably faster than the ego vehicle, the differing lanelets and consistent lateral separation indicate a low risk.  We need to monitor future timesteps to confirm. The overall risk assessment is low (4).
