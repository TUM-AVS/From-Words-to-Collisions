To analyze the risk levels, I'll evaluate the most recent timestep at 8.2 seconds, using observed data trends from earlier timesteps.

### Analysis

1. **Position and Motion Evaluation:**
   - **Ego Vehicle**:
     - Position: (-259.696, -177.8855)
     - Velocity: 4.3509 m/s

   - **Obstacle 30716.0**:
     - Position: (-263.2525, -173.4804)
     - Velocity: 8.5369 m/s

2. **Relative Position and Velocity:**
   - **Relative Position**:
     - Longitudinal: -263.2525 - (-259.696) = -3.5565 m (This indicates the obstacle is behind the ego)
     - Lateral: -173.4804 - (-177.8855) = 4.4051 m (This indicates the obstacle is to the right of the ego)
   
   - **Relative Velocity**:
     - Approximately in the direction of the obstacle, given its higher speed. Ego vehicle is traveling slower and thus, the obstacle is closing the gap.

3. **TTC (Time to Collision):**
   - The obstacle is behind and to the right, and given the relative motion, is not on an immediate collision course.
   - The TTC using simple longitudinal approach since lateral is safe:
     - Longitudinal relative velocity ~ 8.5369 m/s (obstacle is faster)
     - TTC = Longitudinal Position Difference / Relative Longitudinal Velocity â‰ˆ -3.5565 / (8.5369 - 4.3509) > 0
     - This does not apply since the obstacle is behind the ego now and not on a direct collision course, relative velocity calculation assumes it would be closing, but current placement is safe laterally.

4. **MDC (Minimum Distance to Collision):**
   - Direct path lateral and longitudinal separation at this time makes immediate collision unlikely.
   - MDC is determined to be greater than the lateral separation of 4.4051 m, showing safe disparity.

### Conclusion

Given obstacle 30716.0 is maintaining a safe lateral distance and has been consistently behind the ego vehicle, it does not present an immediate collision risk. Therefore, scoring would be more toward low risk.

- **Risk Level for Obstacle 30716.0**: 4 (Low Risk)

### JSON Output

Since none of the obstacles are classified as collision or extreme risk, the JSON will reflect this assessment:

```json
{
    "CollisionObstacles": [],
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {},
    "HighRiskObstacle": {}
}
```

This JSON indicates that currently, there are no immediate or extremely high-risk obstacles for the ego vehicle based on the most recent timestep analysis.
