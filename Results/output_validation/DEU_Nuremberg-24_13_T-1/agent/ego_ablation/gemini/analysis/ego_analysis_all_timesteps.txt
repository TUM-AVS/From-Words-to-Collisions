At the most recent timestep (8.2 seconds), Obstacle 30716 is located at longitudinal -0.77 m and lateral -0.44 m relative to the ego vehicle, placing it very close to the rear-right of the ego vehicle.  The longitudinal distance suggests a high risk of rear-end collision. The lateral offset slightly reduces the direct collision risk but still indicates a very dangerous situation.

The relative longitudinal velocity of 2.77 m/s suggests the obstacle is still approaching the ego vehicle from behind.  The small longitudinal distance coupled with the approaching velocity indicates a very short TTC, likely less than 0.5 seconds, making this an extremely dangerous situation. Even with the lateral movement, the obstacle's trajectory still poses an imminent collision risk.  The relative lateral velocity of 4.70 m/s further indicates that while the obstacle may not directly impact the rear of the ego vehicle, a sideswipe collision is highly probable given the proximity and velocities.


**Proximity:** 1 - Extremely close proximity.
**MDC:** 1 -  Less than 1.0 meter.
**TTC:** 1 - Likely less than 0.5 seconds given the closing velocity and distance.

Overall, Obstacle 30716 represents an extreme risk with an overall risk score of 1 due to the imminent collision possibility.
