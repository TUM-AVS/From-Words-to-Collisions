At the most recent timestep (8.2 seconds), obstacle 30716 is located at the Rear-right of the ego vehicle with a longitudinal distance of -0.77 meters and a lateral distance of -0.44 meters.  The negative longitudinal distance indicates the obstacle is behind the ego vehicle. The negative lateral distance suggests the obstacle is slightly to the right of the ego vehicle.

The relative longitudinal velocity is 2.77 m/s, meaning the obstacle is approaching the ego vehicle from behind. The relative lateral velocity is 4.70 m/s, indicating that the obstacle is also moving towards the right relative to the ego vehicle. The small longitudinal distance and the relatively high lateral velocity suggest a potential lane change maneuver by the obstacle. Given the proximity and the relative velocities, this situation presents a high risk. I classify this obstacle as a High Risk (Risk Score 2) as it is very close and requires immediate attention from the ego vehicle to avoid a potential collision.

Risk Levels:
0: Collision - Physical contact occurred or unavoidable
1: Extreme Risk - Immediate collision likely
2: High Risk - Close to collision, needs quick action
3: Medium Risk - Manageable with proper reaction
4: Low Risk - Minimal risk, sufficient time to react
5: Negligible Risk - No significant risk
