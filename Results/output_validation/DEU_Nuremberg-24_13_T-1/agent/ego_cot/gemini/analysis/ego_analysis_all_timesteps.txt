### Safety analysis for timestep 8.2s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

**Calculations and Reasoning:**

At the last timestep (8.2s), Obstacle 30716 is located at longitudinal -0.77m and lateral -0.77m relative to the ego vehicle.  The relative longitudinal velocity is 2.77 m/s and the relative lateral velocity is 4.70 m/s. Both distances are decreasing, indicating a closing situation. Let's calculate TTC and MDC.

* **Longitudinal TTC (TTClong):**  0.77m / 2.77 m/s = 0.28s
* **Lateral TTC (TTClat):** 0.77m / 4.70 m/s = 0.16s

Since we don't have the dimensions of the vehicles, we'll approximate MDC using the Euclidean distance at the last timestep, which represents the current gap.

* **Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC):** sqrt((-0.77m)^2 + (-0.77m)^2) â‰ˆ 1.09m

**Risk Assessment for Obstacle 30716:**

* **Proximity:** Extremely close. The obstacle is very near the ego vehicle in both longitudinal and lateral directions.
* **MDC:**  The MDC of approximately 1.09m falls into the High-Risk category (2).
* **TTC:** Both TTClong (0.28s) and TTClat (0.16s) fall into the Extreme Risk category (1).

### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID:** 30716
- **Distance Risk reason:** The obstacle is extremely close to the ego vehicle, with negative longitudinal and lateral distances, indicating a potential overlap or imminent collision.
- **Distance safety score:** 1 (Extreme Risk)
- **Time Risk reason:** Both TTClong and TTClat are less than 0.5 seconds, indicating extremely high risk.
- **Time safety score:** 1 (Extreme Risk)
- **Overall Risk score:** 1 (Extreme Risk) The combination of very close proximity and very short TTC suggests an extremely dangerous situation. A collision is highly likely without immediate corrective action.
