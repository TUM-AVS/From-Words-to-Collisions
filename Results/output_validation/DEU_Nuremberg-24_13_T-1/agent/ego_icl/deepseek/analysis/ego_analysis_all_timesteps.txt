### Obstacle Analysis for Obstacle 30716 (Most Recent Timestep: 8.2 seconds)

#### Trajectory Analysis:
- **Position Changes (from 7.3s to 8.2s):**
  - Longitudinal distance decreases from -5.00 m to -0.77 m (approaching from behind).
  - Lateral distance shifts from 0.00 m to -0.44 m (moving toward the right side of the ego vehicle).
  - Relative velocity:
    - Longitudinal: ~4.16 m/s initially, decreasing to ~2.77 m/s (still approaching).
    - Lateral: Increases from 0.41 m/s to 4.70 m/s (rapid lateral movement toward the ego).

- **Motion Description:**  
  The obstacle is driving toward the ego car from behind and laterally from the right. The lateral movement is significant, indicating a diagonal approach.

#### Risk Assessment (8.2s):
- **Adjusted Distances (USE THESE):**
  - Longitudinal: -0.77 m (behind the ego).
  - Lateral: -0.44 m (right side of the ego).
  
- **Relative Velocities:**
  - Longitudinal: 2.77 m/s (closing distance).
  - Lateral: 4.70 m/s (closing distance rapidly).

- **Time-to-Collision (TTC):**
  - Longitudinal TTC: 0.77 m / 2.77 m/s ≈ 0.28 seconds (Extreme Risk, TTC ≤ 0.5s).
  - Lateral TTC: 0.44 m / 4.70 m/s ≈ 0.09 seconds (Extreme Risk, TTC ≤ 0.5s).
  - **Overall TTC:** Dominated by the smaller TTC (lateral: 0.09s).

- **Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC):**
  - The obstacle is diagonally approaching. The smaller distance is lateral (0.44 m), which is in the High Risk range (0.5 < MDC ≤ 1.0 m).
  - However, with the rapid lateral velocity, this distance will shrink to near-zero very quickly.

- **Acceleration Trends:**
  - Longitudinal acceleration is near zero (-0.07 m/s² to 0.02 m/s²), so velocity is roughly constant.
  - Lateral acceleration is negligible (-0.03 m/s²), so lateral velocity remains high.

#### Risk Score:
- **TTC indicates Extreme Risk (0.09s).**
- **MDC indicates High Risk (0.44 m).**
- **Overall Risk:** Prioritize the higher risk (lower score). Thus, **Extreme Risk (1)**.

#### Collision Prediction:
- The obstacle is closing rapidly in both longitudinal and lateral dimensions. At the current rates, a collision is imminent within the next 0.1-0.2 seconds (next timestep). Thus, this is a **Predicted Collision Obstacle**.

### Notes:
- No collision has occurred yet (no physical contact at 8.2s), but the obstacle is on an imminent collision course.
- The Extreme Risk score (1) reflects the immediate danger, and the Predicted Collision score (0) reflects the unavoidable collision in the next timestep unless evasive action is taken.
