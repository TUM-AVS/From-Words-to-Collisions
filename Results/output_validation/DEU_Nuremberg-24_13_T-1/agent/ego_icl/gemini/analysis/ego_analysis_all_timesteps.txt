Obstacle 30716 Analysis:

Trajectory Analysis: This obstacle starts directly behind the ego vehicle and moves closer over each timestep. Initially, the lateral distance is zero, indicating perfect alignment behind the ego vehicle. However, from 7.7 seconds onwards, the obstacle begins to shift to the right of the ego vehicle, with both lateral and longitudinal distances decreasing. The motion description confirms this rightward and forward movement relative to the ego vehicle.

Most Recent Timestep (8.2 seconds):

- Longitudinal distance: -0.77 m (very close)
- Lateral distance: -0.44 m (close)
- Longitudinal relative velocity: 2.77 m/s (approaching rapidly)
- Lateral relative velocity: 4.70 m/s (approaching rapidly)

TTC Calculation:
- Longitudinal TTC: abs(-0.77 m / 2.77 m/s) ≈ 0.28 seconds
- Lateral TTC: abs(-0.44 m / 4.70 m/s) ≈ 0.09 seconds

MDC Calculation: Since the obstacle is approaching diagonally from the rear-right, the minimum distance to collision will be determined by the shorter of the two TTCs.

Risk Assessment:
- Longitudinal risk: Extreme Risk (1) due to TTC < 0.5 seconds and proximity.
- Lateral risk: Extreme Risk (1) due to TTC < 0.5 seconds and proximity.
- Overall Risk: Extreme Risk (1) - The obstacle is extremely close and approaching rapidly from the rear-right. The combined effect of both longitudinal and lateral movement significantly increases the risk of an imminent collision.
