### Analysis:

**Obstacle 30716:**

- **Position and Trajectory Analysis:**
  - The obstacle is consistently approaching the ego vehicle from behind and laterally from the right, indicating a converging trajectory.
  - **Most Recent Timestep (8.2 seconds):**
    - Adjusted longitudinal distance: -0.77 m
    - Adjusted lateral distance: -0.44 m
    - Relative Longitudinal Velocity: 2.77 m/s (approaching)
    - Relative Lateral Velocity: 4.70 m/s (approaching)
    - The obstacle is getting closer both longitudinally and laterally.

- **Time-to-Collision (TTC) Calculation:**
  - **Longitudinal TTC:** 
    - Distance = -0.77 m, Relative Velocity = 2.77 m/s
    - TTC_longitudinal ≈ 0.28 seconds (Using the formula TTC = Distance / |Relative Velocity|)
  - **Lateral TTC:** 
    - Distance = -0.44 m, Relative Velocity = 4.70 m/s
    - TTC_lateral ≈ 0.09 seconds

- **Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC) Calculation:**
  - Both longitudinal and lateral distances are very small and decreasing, indicating a nearing collision.
  - By considering both aspects, MDC ≈ 0 m (since paths are converging and future trajectory indicates overlap).

- **Risk Assessment:**
  - The obstacle trajectory suggests an imminent collision due to both dimensions indicating near-zero distances with converging paths.
  - TTC calculations are below 0.5 seconds for both axes, indicating high urgency.
  - Based on the analysis, Obstacle 30716 is at **Collision Risk (0).**
