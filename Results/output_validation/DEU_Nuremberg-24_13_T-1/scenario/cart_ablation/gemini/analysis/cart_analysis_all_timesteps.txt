At t=8.4s, the ego vehicle is at (-259.5473, -178.7502) and the obstacle (ID 30716.0) is at (-262.0227, -174.628).  The distance between them is approximately 4.6 meters. While this isn't a collision at this exact moment, the trajectories over the past 0.9 seconds show the obstacle rapidly approaching the ego vehicle.  The obstacle's velocity is considerably higher than the ego vehicle's and although fluctuating, its overall trend is towards the ego vehicle's predicted path.  Given the closing speeds and distance, a collision is highly likely in the next timestep or two without intervention. Therefore, I classify this as an extreme risk (level 1).

        "Reasoning": "Obstacle 30716.0 poses an extreme risk of collision with the ego vehicle due to its high closing velocity and proximity at t=8.4s. While not a collision at this instant, the trajectories suggest an imminent collision without corrective action."
