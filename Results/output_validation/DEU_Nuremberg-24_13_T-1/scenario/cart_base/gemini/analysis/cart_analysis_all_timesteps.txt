At t=8.4s, the ego vehicle at (-259.5473, -178.7502) and the obstacle 30716.0 at (-262.0227, -174.628) are in the same lanelet (1930.0).  The distance between them is approximately 4.2 meters. Given their current velocities (ego: 4.3436, obstacle: 8.5186) and the obstacle's deceleration (-1.0679), a collision is likely imminent if the obstacle continues to decelerate rapidly while the ego maintains its current speed. This suggests an *extreme risk* (score 1).  Previous timesteps show the obstacle's acceleration fluctuating, so the risk is high, but not guaranteed collision yet.
