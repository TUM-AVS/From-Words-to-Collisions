### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. **Ego Vehicle**: Moving steadily with minor deceleration.
2. **Obstacles**: Most are static or moving away. Only a few (30704.0, 30711.0, 30712.0, 30716.0) are moving towards but with safe distances and decelerating.
3. **Collision Risk**: No immediate collision risk observed. All obstacles have safe TTC and MDC.
4. **Conclusion**: No collision scenario.
