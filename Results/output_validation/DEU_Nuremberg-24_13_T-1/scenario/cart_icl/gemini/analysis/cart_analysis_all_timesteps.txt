### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 30716.0
- Distance Risk reason: At the most recent timestep (8.4s), the obstacle is in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle and the distance between them has decreased significantly over the past 0.9 seconds.  The obstacle's x-coordinate is approaching the ego's, suggesting a possible collision.
- Distance safety score: 2
- Time Risk reason: The obstacle's velocity is higher than the ego's, and although the accelerations fluctuate, the overall trend shows closing. The decreasing distance combined with the relative velocities points to a high risk in the near future.
- Time safety score: 2
- Overall Risk score: 2

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. **Identify potential collision:** Obstacle 30716.0 shares the same lanelet as the ego vehicle at the final timestep and exhibits a decreasing distance.
2. **Analyze trajectories:** The obstacle's trajectory shows consistent movement towards the ego vehicle's path over the provided time steps.
3. **Assess risk:** Based on the proximity, relative velocities, and shared lanelet, the scenario presents a high risk of collision if no evasive action is taken.  While not an immediate collision (score 0), the risk is beyond just "medium" due to the converging trajectories and speed differential.
