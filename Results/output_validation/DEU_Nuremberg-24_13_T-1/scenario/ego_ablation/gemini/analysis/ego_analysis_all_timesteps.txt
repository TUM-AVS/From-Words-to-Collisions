Obstacle 30716 is extremely close to the ego vehicle at the last timestep (8.4 seconds).  It is at 0.00m longitudinally and -0.24m laterally, indicating it is essentially alongside the ego vehicle and very slightly to the right. The relative velocity shows that it is moving forward relative to the ego (2.45 m/s) and significantly to the right (5.14 m/s). Although the lateral movement might suggest diverging paths, the extremely close proximity combined with forward movement raises serious concerns. The Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC) would be very small (approximately 0.24m), and Time-to-Collision (TTC) would be very short as well, making this an extremely risky situation.
