Obstacle 30716 is now to the right of the ego vehicle, very close laterally (-0.24m). The longitudinal distance is 0.00m, meaning it is aligned longitudinally with the ego. The lateral velocity (5.14 m/s) indicates Obstacle 30716 is moving quickly towards the ego's right side. Though not a collision in this timestep, the very close proximity and high lateral velocity suggest an extremely high risk of collision in the next timestep.

**Risk Levels and Definitions:**
<Collision (Score: 0)>: Actual collision has occurred or is unavoidable within the next timestep.
<Extreme Risk (Score: 1)>: Immediate collision or very high likelihood of impact. Urgent action is required.
<High Risk (Score: 2)>: Close to collision or highly probable collision path. Needs prompt attention and quick manoeuvring.
<Medium Risk (Score: 3)>: Moderate collision risk but manageable with timely reactions and proper strategies.
<Low Risk (Score: 4)>: Minimal collision risk. The situation is controllable with sufficient time to react.
<Negligible Risk (Score: 5)>: No significant collision risk. Obstacles are either moving away or far enough not to interfere.
