### Safety analysis for timestep 7.5s - 8.4s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:
- **Obstacle ID:** 30716
- **Distance Risk reason:**  The obstacle starts behind the ego vehicle and moves closer in both longitudinal and lateral directions over the time steps.  At 8.4 seconds, both longitudinal and lateral distances reach 0, indicating a collision.
- **Distance safety score:** 0
- **Time Risk reason:** The provided data shows a decreasing distance between the ego vehicle and the obstacle with every timestep.  The relative velocity and motion description further confirm the risk of collision.
- **Time safety score:** 0
- **Overall Risk score:** 0
