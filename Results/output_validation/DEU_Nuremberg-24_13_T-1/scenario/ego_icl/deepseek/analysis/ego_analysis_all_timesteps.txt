### Obstacle-by-Obstacle Analysis (Most Recent Timestep: 8.4s)

**Obstacle 30716:**
- **Position:** Right of ego (longitudinal = 0.00m, lateral = -0.24m)
- **Motion:** Exact longitudinal alignment (side-by-side), moving laterally toward ego from the right (lateral velocity = 5.14 m/s)
- **Relative Velocity:** Longitudinal = 2.45 m/s (moving ahead of ego), Lateral = 5.14 m/s (closing rapidly)
- **Trajectory Analysis:**
  - From 7.5s to 8.4s, the obstacle transitions from behind to side-by-side with increasing lateral velocity.
  - Lateral distance decreases from 0.00m to -0.24m in the last timestep, with a high closing speed (5.14 m/s).
  - Longitudinal distance closes from -4.12m to 0.00m, but the obstacle is now aligned longitudinally.

**Key Metrics:**
1. **Time-to-Collision (TTC):**
   - Lateral TTC = |Lateral Distance| / |Lateral Velocity| = 0.24 / 5.14 ≈ 0.047s (Extreme Risk, TTC ≤ 0.5s)
   - Longitudinal TTC = N/A (longitudinal distance is 0.00m but velocities are not closing longitudinally).

2. **Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC):**
   - Since the obstacle is side-by-side (longitudinal = 0.00m), MDC is the lateral distance = 0.24m (Extreme Risk, MDC ≤ 0.5m).

3. **Risk Assessment:**
   - TTC (0.047s) indicates Extreme Risk (1).
   - MDC (0.24m) indicates Extreme Risk (1).
   - Overall Risk Score: 1 (Extreme Risk).

### Collision Scenario Determination
- The obstacle is side-by-side with the ego (longitudinal = 0.00m) and closing laterally at a very high speed (5.14 m/s). The lateral distance (0.24m) is critically small, and the TTC (0.047s) is extremely low, indicating an imminent collision if trajectories are maintained.
- This qualifies as a collision scenario due to the Extreme Risk (score 1) with TTC < 0.5s and MDC < 0.5m.
