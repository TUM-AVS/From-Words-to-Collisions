Obstacle 30716 Analysis:

Trajectory Analysis: This obstacle starts behind the ego vehicle and moves closer over the timesteps. Initially, it's directly behind (lateral distance ≈ 0), then shifts slightly to the rear-right.  The longitudinal distance consistently decreases, indicating an approaching trajectory. The lateral movement also indicates a potential lane change or drift towards the ego vehicle.

At the last timestep (8.4 seconds):

* **Longitudinal:** The obstacle is right next to the ego vehicle (0.00m longitudinal distance), which indicates alignment along the longitudinal axis. The positive relative velocity (2.45 m/s) indicates that it continues to move forward relative to the ego vehicle, possibly overtaking.
* **Lateral:** The lateral distance is -0.24m, which is very close. The positive lateral velocity of 5.14 m/s indicates it's moving to the left, towards the ego vehicle from its right side.

TTC Calculation:

* Longitudinal TTC: Not applicable as the vehicles are longitudinally aligned and obstacle is moving forward relative to the ego vehicle.
* Lateral TTC = |Distance| / |Relative Velocity| = 0.24m / 5.14 m/s ≈ 0.05 seconds

MDC Calculation: Due to the near-zero longitudinal distance and close lateral distance with a high rate of lateral closure, the MDC is estimated to be less than 0.5m.


Risk Assessment:

* Longitudinal Risk: Although the obstacle is close longitudinally, there's no imminent collision risk in the longitudinal direction as its relative forward motion will mostly move it parallel to the ego vehicle.
* Lateral Risk: The very small lateral distance, very small lateral TTC (0.05 seconds), and closing lateral velocity (5.14 m/s) indicate an extremely high risk of lateral collision.

Overall Risk: Based on the lateral risk assessment (TTC < 0.5s and MDC < 0.5m with converging trajectories), Obstacle 30716 poses an *Extreme Risk (1)* of collision at 8.4 seconds.


Collision Scenario Determination:

Yes, this is a collision scenario. Obstacle 30716 has an overall risk score of 1 (Extreme Risk) with a very low TTC (< 0.5s) and a very small MDC (< 0.5m). This meets the criteria for a collision scenario.
