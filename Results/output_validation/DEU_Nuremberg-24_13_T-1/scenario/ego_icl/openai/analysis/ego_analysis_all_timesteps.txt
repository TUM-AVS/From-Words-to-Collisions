### Analysis of Obstacle 30716

#### Background Trajectory and Movement
Over the given timesteps from 7.5 to 8.4 seconds, Obstacle 30716 showed the following trajectory:
- It is primarily approaching from the rear-right of the ego vehicle.
- Throughout the sequence, both longitudinal and lateral distances are decreasing, indicating the obstacle is closing in on the ego vehicle.
- The relative velocities, both longitudinally and laterally, are positive, showing this obstacle is moving towards the ego.

#### Analysis of the Most Recent Timestep (8.4 seconds)
- **Position & Distance**: 
  - Adjusted longitudinal distance: 0.00 m
  - Adjusted lateral distance: -0.24 m (this distance will be considered as 0.24 m for calculation purposes as actual negative distances indicate direction rather than true alignment in context)
- **Relative Velocity**: 
  - Longitudinal velocity: 2.45 m/s (approaching)
  - Lateral velocity: 5.14 m/s (approaching)
- **Motion Description**: "Exact longitudinal alignment or co. Obstacle is driving toward the ego car laterally from the right."

#### Calculations
1. **Time-to-Collision (TTC) Calculation**
   - **Longitudinal TTC**: 
     - Since the longitudinal distance is 0.00 m, technically it could be immediate collision, however the motion indicates side approach (lateral importance).
   - **Lateral TTC**: 
     - Distance: 0.24 m
     - Relative speed: 5.14 m/s
     - TTC = 0.24 / 5.14 = approximately 0.0467 seconds

2. **Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC)**
   - A projection analysis indicates that minimum distance is mainly through lateral component as longitudinal is already aligned.
   - Lateral distance is 0.24 m which is within the collision risk range.

#### Risk Assessment
- Due to the very small lateral distance and convergence speed, and with zero longitudinal separation:
  - The **MDC** being 0.24 m indicates an **Extreme Risk (1)** level.
  - The **TTC** being as low as approximately 0.0467 seconds indicates that this is likely an immediate concern.
  
Given that the lateral distance is below 0.5 meters with a closing relative velocity significantly high in a short time coming from the rear-right alignment, the most recent timestep shows that the obstacle is about to collide from the side.

#### Conclusion
This analysis identifies this as an extreme risk scenario due to very low lateral distance, zero longitudinal distance with significant approach speed. The trajectory determined from previous timesteps supports that this is an imminent collision situation.
