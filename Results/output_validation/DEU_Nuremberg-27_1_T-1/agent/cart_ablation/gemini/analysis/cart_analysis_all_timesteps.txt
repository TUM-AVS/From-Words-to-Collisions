Here's the collision risk analysis:

**Obstacle 30623:** This obstacle is stationary and located in the same lane as the ego vehicle, but sufficiently far away.  It represents minimal risk throughout the provided timeframe. Risk score: 5

**Obstacle 30625:** This obstacle is in a different lane and moving. Its trajectory doesn't appear to intersect with the ego vehicle's path in the given timeframe. Risk score: 5

**Obstacle 30626:** Similar to 30625, this obstacle is also in a different lane and poses no immediate threat. Risk score: 5

**Obstacle 30628:** This obstacle is the most critical. It is in the same lane as the ego vehicle and initially moving at a similar speed. However, over the time steps, its velocity decreases significantly, even becoming negative at the final time step. This behavior creates a high risk of a rear-end collision if the ego vehicle maintains its speed and trajectory. Risk score: 2-3 (The exact risk level may depend on additional data and safety margins). Note: From the given data, it is unlikely to have a collision or extreme risk in the next second, but the risk of a collision with this obstacle starts to appear at the end of the period.
