Obstacle 30623.0: This obstacle is stationary and far from the ego vehicle, posing no risk. Risk score: 5

Obstacle 30625.0: This obstacle is in a different lane (912) than the ego vehicle (913). Although its trajectory might bring it closer to the ego vehicle's lane, there's no indication of an immediate or high risk of collision within the provided time window. Risk score: 3

Obstacle 30626.0: Similar to obstacle 30625, this obstacle is also in lane 912 and doesn't pose an immediate or high risk of collision. Risk score: 3


Obstacle 30628.0: This obstacle is in the same lane as the ego vehicle (913). Initially, it's moving slightly faster than the ego vehicle, but then its velocity decreases significantly, especially in the last few timesteps. While the distance between them is decreasing, it's unlikely to lead to a collision within the predicted timeframe, however due to the closing distance and velocity fluctuation it poses a high risk and needs to be monitored. Risk score: 2
