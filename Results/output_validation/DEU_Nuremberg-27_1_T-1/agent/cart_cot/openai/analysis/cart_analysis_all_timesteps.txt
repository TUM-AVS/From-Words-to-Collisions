Let's first analyze the scenario based on the information provided for each obstacle at the most recent timestep (5.1 seconds) to evaluate their relative positions, velocities compared to the ego vehicle, and assess potential risk levels.

1. **Obstacle 30623.0**:  
   - This obstacle has been stationary across all timesteps. Its distance from the ego vehicle is significant, and there is no sign of imminent collision.  
   - **Overall Risk Score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)

2. **Obstacle 30625.0**:  
   - The obstacle is in lanelet 912 and moving steadily away from the ego vehicle with consistent velocity, not directly affecting the ego's path. There is no risk of collision as the obstacle is not on a collision course with the ego vehicle.  
   - **Overall Risk Score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)

3. **Obstacle 30626.0**:  
   - This obstacle is also in lanelet 912, consistently moving at a high speed but is not on a direct path of collision with the ego. The vehicle is moving parallel to the ego-vehicle’s lane with no immediate threat of collision. 
   - **Overall Risk Score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)

4. **Obstacle 30628.0**:  
   - This obstacle is in the same lanelet as the ego (913). They are closely aligned in terms of position and orientation in a potentially concerning parallel path with modest proximity. However, obstacle 30628 is decelerating over time.
   - The close parallel position could create complexity, especially with its velocity decreasing over time creating a temporary risk factor. The potential for easing through intentional deceleration exists.
   - This obstacle can be assessed with a **Medium Risk** due to its close alignment with the ego vehicle’s path.
   - **Overall Risk Score**: 3 (Medium Risk)

Considering the above analysis, it appears that there is no direct collision scenario (Overall Risk Score of 0), nor an extreme risk scenario (Overall Risk Score of 1) based on current trajectories and TTC/MDC interpretations.

Here's the structured JSON output summarizing these findings:
