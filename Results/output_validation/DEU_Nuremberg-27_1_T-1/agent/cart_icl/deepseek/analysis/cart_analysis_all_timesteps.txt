### Analysis:

1. **Obstacle 30623.0**:
   - **Position**: (288.0825, 268.8859) - Stationary (velocity = 0.0, acceleration = 0.0).
   - **Relative Motion**: Ego is moving away from this obstacle (distance increasing over time).
   - **Risk**: **Negligible (5)** - No immediate danger.

2. **Obstacle 30625.0**:
   - **Position**: (306.3378, 258.3657) - Moving at 8.4751 m/s, same lanelet as ego (lanelet 912.0).
   - **Relative Motion**: Ego is moving towards this obstacle, but the obstacle is moving away faster.
   - **Risk**: **Low (4)** - No immediate danger.

3. **Obstacle 30626.0**:
   - **Position**: (291.5787, 263.8936) - Moving at 8.358 m/s, same lanelet as ego (lanelet 912.0).
   - **Relative Motion**: Ego is moving towards this obstacle, but the obstacle is moving away faster.
   - **Risk**: **Low (4)** - No immediate danger.

4. **Obstacle 30628.0**:
   - **Position**: (313.5046, 259.3103) - Moving at 6.6508 m/s, same lanelet as ego (lanelet 913.0).
   - **Relative Motion**: Ego is moving towards this obstacle, and the obstacle is decelerating (-1.7 m/sÂ²).
   - **TTC**: Calculated based on relative distance and velocity.
   - **Risk**: **High (2)** - Close to collision, needs urgent action.
