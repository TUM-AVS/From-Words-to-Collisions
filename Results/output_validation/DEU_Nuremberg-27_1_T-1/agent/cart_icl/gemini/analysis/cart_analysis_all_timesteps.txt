Obstacle 30628 is in the same lane as the ego vehicle and shows a concerning trend. While it starts ahead of the ego vehicle, its velocity decreases significantly over the timesteps, eventually becoming slower than the ego vehicle. This creates a high risk of a rear-end collision if the ego vehicle does not decelerate. Additionally, the large negative acceleration values in the later timesteps suggest erratic behavior, further increasing the risk.

Obstacle 30623 remains stationary throughout the scenario and is laterally separated from the ego vehicle. It poses no immediate risk.

Obstacles 30625 and 30626 are in a different lane and maintain a safe lateral distance from the ego vehicle, posing no immediate risk.
