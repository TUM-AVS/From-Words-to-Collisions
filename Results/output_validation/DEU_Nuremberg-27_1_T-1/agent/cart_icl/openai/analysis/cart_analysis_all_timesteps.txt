To evaluate the risk levels within this scenario, we'll focus on the most recent timestep at 5.1 seconds, while considering the motion trends from previous timesteps.

### Analysis:

1. **Obstacle 30623.0**:
   - **Position**: (288.0825, 268.8859)
   - **Velocity**: 0.0 m/s (stationary)
   - **Lanelet**: Same as Ego (913.0)
   - **Relative Position**: Approximately 22 meters from Ego laterally; no longitudinal movement.
   - **Risk**: Given its stationary status and lateral position, there's no immediate risk (5: Negligible Risk).

2. **Obstacle 30625.0**:
   - **Position**: (306.3378, 258.3657)
   - **Velocity**: 8.4751 m/s
   - **Lanelet**: Adjacent to Ego (912.0)
   - **Relative Position**: Behind the Ego vehicle by about 3 meters longitudinally and slightly offset laterally.
   - **Risk**: Its trajectory is separated but could eventually merge into Ego's path if the lanelets converge; however, it maintains safe distances as of now. **TTC and MDC calculations suggest manageable overlap**, thus posing a medium to low risk for now (4: Low Risk).

3. **Obstacle 30626.0**:
   - **Position**: (291.5787, 263.8936)
   - **Velocity**: 8.3580 m/s
   - **Lanelet**: Adjacent (912.0)
   - **Relative Position**: Slightly behind Ego and moving parallel.
   - **Risk**: Trajectory likely remains parallel without significant threat of collision in the immediate term (4: Low Risk).

4. **Obstacle 30628.0**:
   - **Position**: (313.5046, 259.3103)
   - **Velocity**: 6.6508 m/s
   - **Lanelet**: Same as Ego (913.0)
   - **Relative Position**: Ahead of Ego by about 4 meters in the same lane.
   - **Risk**: It’s ahead and decelerating, decreasing velocity difference. However, rapid deceleration (-1.7 m/s²) could reduce following distance quickly, posing a **moderate risk** of needing corrective action (3: Medium Risk).

### Conclusion:

- **No obstacles want urgency corresponding to a Collision Risk (0) or Extreme Risk (1)** in this timeframe. 

- **Obstacle with the highest urgency**: Obstacle 30628.0 with medium risk due to proximity and quick deceleration.
