At t=5.1 seconds, the following analysis is performed for each obstacle:

**Obstacle 30623:** This obstacle poses negligible risk with longitudinal distance of 17.40 m and lateral distance of 0.00 m.  It's moving towards the ego vehicle longitudinally at -3.45 m/s but the distance is substantial. Proximity (5), MDC (5), TTC (5).

**Obstacle 30625:** This obstacle is located in the Left of the ego car with longitudinal distance of 0.00 m and a lateral distance of 1.92 m. Although it is moving away laterally to the left, the near-zero longitudinal distance indicates a high risk of collision.  Proximity (2), MDC (2), TTC (1).

**Obstacle 30626:** This obstacle is located Front-left of the ego car with longitudinal distance of 12.41 m and lateral distance of 1.75 m. It's moving towards the ego vehicle longitudinally at -11.81 m/s, and slightly away laterally.  The proximity is moderate but the high closing speed warrants attention. Proximity (4), MDC (4), TTC (3).

**Obstacle 30628:** This obstacle is behind the ego vehicle at a longitudinal distance of -0.75 m. It's approaching the ego vehicle with a relative longitudinal velocity of 3.19 m/s. Although there is close proximity at the current timestep, the longitudinal and lateral distances are very close, indicating extreme risk of collision.  Proximity (1), MDC (1), TTC (1).
