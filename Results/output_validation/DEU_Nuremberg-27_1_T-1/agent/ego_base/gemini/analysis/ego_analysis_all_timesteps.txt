At t=5.1s:
- **Obstacle 30623**: Located 17.40m in front of the ego vehicle, poses a negligible risk with a risk score of 5 due to the large longitudinal distance and low closing velocity.

- **Obstacle 30625**: Located 1.92m laterally from the ego vehicle (left side) with the same longitudinal coordinate, indicating it is beside the ego car. Given the low lateral velocity, this obstacle poses a low risk (risk score 4). No immediate action is required, but the situation needs to be monitored.

- **Obstacle 30626**: Located 12.41m longitudinally and 1.75m laterally from the ego vehicle, moving towards the ego car both longitudinally and slightly laterally. Considering the distances and relative motion, it can be categorized as a medium risk obstacle, with a score of 3. 

- **Obstacle 30628**: Located -0.75m longitudinally, meaning it is very close behind the ego vehicle and closing in. This is a high-risk situation (risk score 2) that demands prompt action to avoid a collision.

Risk Levels:
0: Collision - Physical contact occurred or unavoidable
1: Extreme Risk - Immediate collision likely
2: High Risk - Close to collision, needs quick action
3: Medium Risk - Manageable with proper reaction
4: Low Risk - Minimal risk, sufficient time to react
5: Negligible Risk - No significant risk
