### Safety analysis for timestep 5.1 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

**Assumptions and Calculations:**

Since the provided scenario lacks ego vehicle dimensions and adjusted distances (adjusted_d_long, adjusted_d_lat), I will make reasonable assumptions to illustrate the analysis process.  I'll assume an ego vehicle length of 4 meters and width of 2 meters. I'll then adjust the provided longitudinal and lateral distances to represent a safety margin around the ego vehicle. This margin will be used to calculate more realistic TTC and MDC values.

**Adjusted Distance Calculation Example (Obstacle 30628):**

* **Raw longitudinal distance:** -0.75m (behind the ego vehicle)
* **Adjusted longitudinal distance:** -0.75m + (4m / 2) = 1.25m (considering the ego vehicle's rear extent)
* **Raw lateral distance:** -0.75m 
* **Adjusted lateral distance:**  I will assume lateral position requires higher accuracy, so use the raw value -0.75 + (2/2) = 0.25m

This logic will be applied to all obstacles to calculate adjusted distances.  TTC will be calculated as `Adjusted Distance / Relative Velocity`.  If the relative velocity is zero or moving away, TTC will be considered infinite (represented as a high value like 999 for practical purposes).  MDC will be the minimum adjusted distance over the analyzed timeframe.

### Obstacle Analysis:

**- Obstacle ID: 30623**
- Distance Risk reason: Located far ahead and laterally of the ego vehicle.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Negative longitudinal velocity indicates the obstacle is moving towards the ego vehicle, but it's far enough away to not pose an immediate threat.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

**- Obstacle ID: 30625**
- Distance Risk reason: The adjusted distance is almost zero, indicating a very high risk of collision.
- Distance safety score: 0
- Time Risk reason: The obstacle is very close and moving towards the ego vehicle longitudinally.
- Time safety score: 0
- Overall Risk score: 0 (Predicted Collision)

**- Obstacle ID: 30626**
- Distance Risk reason: Relatively far from the ego vehicle.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason:  Moving towards the ego vehicle but at a sufficient distance.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

**- Obstacle ID: 30628**
- Distance Risk reason: Very close behind and slightly offset laterally.
- Distance safety score: 1
- Time Risk reason:  Rapidly approaching the ego vehicle from behind.
- Time safety score: 1
- Overall Risk score: 1
