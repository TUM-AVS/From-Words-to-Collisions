Given the details you provided, I'll analyze the most recent timestep (5.1 seconds) for the obstacles around the ego vehicle to determine potential collision risks.

### Obstacle Analysis

#### Obstacle 30623 - Front
- **Adjusted Distances:** Longitudinal = 17.40 m, Lateral = 0.00 m
- **Velocities:** Longitudinal = -3.45 m/s, Lateral = 0.00 m/s
- **TTC (Longitudinal):** 
  - TTC = 17.40 / 3.45 ≈ 5.04 seconds
- **MDC:** Maintains a safe longitudinal distance with negligible lateral change.
- **Risk Assessment:** TTC is just above 5 seconds with no significant lateral change. Thus, no immediate risk.
- **Risk Score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)

#### Obstacle 30625 - Left
- **Adjusted Distances:** Longitudinal = 0.00 m (aligned), Lateral = 1.92 m
- **Velocities:** Longitudinal = -11.93 m/s, Lateral = 0.17 m/s (away)
- **MDC:** Initial alignment but diverging laterally.
- **Risk Assessment:** The obstacle moves laterally away from the ego vehicle. Even with exact alignment, there's no risk of collision.
- **Risk Score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)

#### Obstacle 30626 - Front-Left
- **Adjusted Distances:** Longitudinal = 12.41 m, Lateral = 1.75 m
- **Velocities:** Longitudinal = -11.81 m/s, Lateral = 0.07 m/s (away)
- **TTC (Longitudinal):** 
  - TTC = 12.41 / 11.81 ≈ 1.05 seconds
- **MDC:** Safe lateral distance with longitudinally decreasing gap.
- **Risk Assessment:** Approaching rapidly, suggest monitoring.
- **Risk Score:** 3 (Medium Risk)

#### Obstacle 30628 - Behind
- **Adjusted Distances:** Longitudinal = -0.75 m (overlap, aligned), Lateral = 0.00 m
- **Velocities:** Longitudinal = 3.19 m/s, Lateral = -0.23 m/s
- **TTC (Longitudinal):** 
  - Already in an overlapping position.
- **MDC:** Overlapping position indicates imminent contact.
- **Risk Assessment:** Overlap suggests collision or a very recent collision.
- **Risk Score:** 0 (Collision Risk)

### Summary and Conclusion
Considering the detailed analysis of the most recent timestep with adjusted distances, we have identified the potential collision risks and scored the obstacles accordingly.

```json
{
    "CollisionObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "30628",
        "OverallRiskScore": "0"
    },
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "N/A",
        "OverallRiskScore": ""
    },
    "HighRiskObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "N/A",
        "OverallRiskScore": ""
    }
}
```

- **Obstacle 30628** is in collision with the ego vehicle due to overlapping positioning.
- No other obstacles are deemed to be at an immediate risk level progressing beyond Medium Risk.
