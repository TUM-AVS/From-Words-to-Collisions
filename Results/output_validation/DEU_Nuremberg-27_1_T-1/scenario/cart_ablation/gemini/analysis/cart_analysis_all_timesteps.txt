At t=5.3s, Ego (30627.0) is at (307.9825, 261.5236) in lanelet 913.0.

Obstacle 30623.0 is stationary far away in the same lanelet and poses no risk.

Obstacles 30625.0 and 30626.0 are in lanelet 912.0, laterally separated from Ego.  Their trajectories don't indicate an immediate risk.

Obstacle 30628.0 is at (312.3317, 259.777) in the same lanelet as Ego, and is moving slower than the ego vehicle, with longitudinal coordinate closer to the ego vehicle. Although there is greater distance between the two vehicles along the x-axis, and reduced speed from the previous timestep, there is still some risk of collision.  I will rate as a 2 (High Risk). Given the rapid deceleration of Obstacle 30628.0 over the past few timesteps, and the relatively small change in ego vehicle velocity, there exists some risk of collision if 30628.0 comes to a faster than predicted stop.
