At t=5.3s, Ego (30627.0) is in lanelet 913.0 at (307.9825, 261.5236).

* Obstacle 30623.0: Stationary and far from Ego, no risk.
* Obstacle 30625.0: In different lanelet (912.0), moderate lateral separation, and moving away from Ego. Low risk.
* Obstacle 30626.0:  In different lanelet (912.0), larger lateral separation than 30625.0. Low risk.
* Obstacle 30628.0: In the same lanelet as Ego (913.0) at (312.3317, 259.777), relatively close longitudinally and laterally.  While its velocity is decreasing, the longitudinal distance is still small, posing a high risk.  However, given the deceleration trend over the past few timesteps, a collision is not imminent in the next immediate moment.
