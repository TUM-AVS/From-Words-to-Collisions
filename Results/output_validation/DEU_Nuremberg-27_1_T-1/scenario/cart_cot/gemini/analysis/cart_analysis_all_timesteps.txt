### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

- Obstacle ID: 30623.0
- Distance Risk reason: This obstacle is stationary and located in the ego vehicle's lane, but laterally offset.  While the lateral distance is significant over the provided timesteps, the fact that it remains stationary in the ego's lane represents a potential future hazard.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason:  The obstacle is stationary, so no immediate time-based risk. However, its static presence in the ego vehicle's lane warrants attention.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- Obstacle ID: 30625.0
- Distance Risk reason: Located in a different lane, maintaining a safe lateral distance from the ego vehicle.  No significant risk observed over the provided timesteps.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Moving with a relatively constant velocity in a different lane, not posing an immediate threat.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 30626.0
- Distance Risk reason: Located in a different lane, maintaining a safe lateral distance from the ego vehicle.  No significant risk observed over the provided timesteps.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Moving with a relatively constant velocity in a different lane, not posing an immediate threat.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 30628.0
- Distance Risk reason: This obstacle is in the same lane as the ego vehicle and initially poses a low risk. However, its deceleration over subsequent timesteps causes concern as the distance between the vehicles decreases. Although a collision is not imminent within the observed timeframe, the trend suggests a potential for increased risk in the near future.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Initially moving at a similar speed to the ego vehicle.  However, its deceleration creates a relative velocity difference, which needs to be closely monitored, as evidenced by the trend over the provided timesteps.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4



### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. **Most critical obstacles:** Obstacle 30623.0 (stationary in ego lane) and 30628.0 (in the same lane, decelerating).
2. **Trajectory analysis:** 30623.0 remains stationary throughout the scenario. 30628.0 decelerates significantly during the last few timesteps, while the ego vehicle maintains a nearly constant velocity.
3. **Relative position, velocity, and acceleration:** The ego vehicle is approaching 30628.0, while the distance to 30623.0 decreases only slightly given the stationary status of obstacle 30623.0
4. **Collision determination:**  No collision is observed within the provided 10 timesteps. However, with Obstacle 30628.0 decelerating and being in the ego vehicle's path, it poses an elevated risk that needs monitoring over the coming timesteps. The stationary obstacle 30623.0 warrants observation to ensure that it does not cause future issues.
5. **Reasoning:** While no immediate collision is detected, the current trends suggest that a collision with obstacle 30628.0 could be possible without intervention based on the final moments data and the relative deceleration rate. Obstacle 30623.0, whilst stationary, needs to be monitored to determine if a maneuver around will be required in future timesteps.
