### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 30623.0
- Distance Risk reason: Stationary and laterally distant from ego vehicle's trajectory.  No risk observed in the provided timesteps.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Stationary, poses no time-related risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 30625.0
- Distance Risk reason: In adjacent lane and moving forward, maintaining a safe lateral distance. History shows consistent behavior.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Moving forward with slightly fluctuating but safe velocity, no indication of sudden changes in past timesteps.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 30626.0
- Distance Risk reason: In adjacent lane and moving forward, maintaining a safe lateral distance. History shows consistent behavior.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Moving forward with slightly fluctuating velocity but poses no immediate threat based on history.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 30628.0
- Distance Risk reason: In the same lane, but sufficiently behind the ego vehicle.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Though decelerating, it remains behind the ego vehicle, and the distance is increasing. History suggests no sudden changes in trajectory.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. At the most recent timestamp (5.3s), no obstacle is in close proximity to the ego vehicle.
2. Analyzing the trajectories over the past 10 timesteps confirms that obstacle 30623.0 is stationary and far from the ego vehicle. Obstacles 30625.0 and 30626.0 are in the adjacent lane and moving forward, posing no risk. Obstacle 30628.0 is in the same lane but behind the ego vehicle and moving away.
3. No obstacle presents a collision risk based on distance and time metrics, considering the trajectory history.
