### Obstacle Analysis:

#### Obstacle ID: 30623.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is stationary with no change in position over time and remains in a different section of the lanelet.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: Due to zero velocity and acceleration, the obstacle remains non-threatening in temporal evaluation.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 30625.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is in an adjacent lanelet, and its trajectory does not intersect with the ego vehicle's path. The longitudinal distance remains significant.
- **Distance safety score**: 4
- **Time Risk reason**: A consistent velocity with minor acceleration indicates the obstacle is maintaining its path without deviating into the ego lane.
- **Time safety score**: 4
- **Overall Risk score**: 4

#### Obstacle ID: 30626.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle's trajectory remains consistent within its lanelet, maintaining a safe distance from the ego vehicle.
- **Distance safety score**: 4
- **Time Risk reason**: Moderate velocity and slight acceleration changes pose no immediate risk as the obstacle does not approach the ego vehicle's lane.
- **Time safety score**: 4
- **Overall Risk score**: 4

#### Obstacle ID: 30628.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: Positioned ahead of the ego vehicle in the same lane, but the gap maintained ensures a safe following distance.
- **Distance safety score**: 4
- **Time Risk reason**: Slight deceleration trends suggest increasing safety margins over time, with velocity reducing.
- **Time safety score**: 4
- **Overall Risk score**: 4

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
No obstacles present a collision threat at the most recent timestep. All maintained trajectories and velocities demonstrate significant separation from the ego vehicle. Each obstacle shows no converging path towards the ego vehicle, suggesting a non-critical scenario for collision.
