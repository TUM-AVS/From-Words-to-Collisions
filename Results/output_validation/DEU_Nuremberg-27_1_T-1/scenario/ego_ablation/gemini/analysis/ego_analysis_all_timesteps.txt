Obstacle 30628 is at high risk of collision with the ego vehicle. It is extremely close behind the ego vehicle (-0.18m) and closing at 2.68 m/s.  Although there is lateral movement away from the ego, the longitudinal motion suggests a very likely collision in the next timestep. Obstacle 30625 is also a concern, but is slightly less urgent given its purely lateral motion, hence medium risk, not high.
