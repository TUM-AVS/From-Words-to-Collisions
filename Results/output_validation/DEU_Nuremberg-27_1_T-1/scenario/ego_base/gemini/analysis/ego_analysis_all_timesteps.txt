Obstacle 30628 is very close to the ego vehicle at a longitudinal distance of -0.18m (behind the ego vehicle).  The relative velocity indicates that it is approaching the ego vehicle at 2.68 m/s. Though the relative acceleration is positive at 2.88 m/sÂ², the small distance and relatively high closing speed suggests an imminent collision. Thus, it is categorized as an extreme risk.

**Risk Levels and Definitions:**
<Collision (Score: 0)>: Actual collision has occurred or is unavoidable within the next timestep.
<Extreme Risk (Score: 1)>: Immediate collision or very high likelihood of impact. Urgent action is required.
<High Risk (Score: 2)>: Close to collision or highly probable collision path. Needs prompt attention and quick manoeuvring.
<Medium Risk (Score: 3)>: Moderate collision risk but manageable with timely reactions and proper strategies.
<Low Risk (Score: 4)>: Minimal collision risk. The situation is controllable with sufficient time to react.
<Negligible Risk (Score: 5)>: No significant collision risk. Obstacles are either moving away or far enough not to interfere.
