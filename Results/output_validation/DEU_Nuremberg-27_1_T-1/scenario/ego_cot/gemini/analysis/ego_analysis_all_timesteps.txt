**Detailed Analysis and Reasoning across Timesteps:**

The primary concern across the provided timesteps is **Obstacle 30625**.  It consistently approaches the ego vehicle with a high closing velocity and minimal lateral movement.  It transitions from a high risk to a collision within the analyzed timeframe.  Obstacle 30628 also poses a risk from behind, but the data suggests it might be overtaking or changing lanes rather than heading for a direct collision. Obstacle 30623 and 30626 maintain safe distances and do not pose immediate threats within the analyzed timesteps.

**Important Note:**  The provided data lacks the ego vehicle's motion, which is crucial for accurate TTC calculation.  My analysis assumes the ego vehicle maintains a constant velocity.  If the ego vehicle is also braking or accelerating, the TTC values and risk assessments would change.  The lateral movement of obstacles and the ego vehicle is also critical; "exact lateral alignment or unknown case" introduces uncertainty in truly assessing the lateral risk.

**Collision Prediction**:

Based on the provided trajectory, a collision with **Obstacle 30625** is highly probable between 4.8s and 4.9s. At 4.8s, the distance is only 0.22m, and by 4.9s, it registers as 0.00m, suggesting a collision or extremely near miss has occurred.


This analysis highlights the necessity for continuous monitoring and proactive avoidance maneuvers in autonomous driving.  The rapid change in risk status for Obstacle 30625 underscores the need for robust and responsive safety systems.
