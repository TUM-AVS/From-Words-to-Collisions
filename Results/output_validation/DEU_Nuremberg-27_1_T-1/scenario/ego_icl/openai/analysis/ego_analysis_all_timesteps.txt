### Obstacle-by-Obstacle Analysis

#### Obstacle 30623 (Front)

- **Adjusted Distances**: Longitudinal = 16.71m, Lateral = 0.00m
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal = -3.45 m/s, Lateral = 0.00 m/s
- **Relative Acceleration**: Both components near zero.

Trajectory Analysis:
- Observed consistent decrease in longitudinal distance over the last few timesteps, indicating a closing gap.
- Lateral distance is 0.00m, but with no decrease indicating alignment without immediate collision risk.
  
TTC Calculation:
- \( \text{TTC}_{long} = \frac{16.71}{3.45} \approx 4.84 \, \text{seconds} \)

Risk Assessment:
- **MDC**: Since lateral distance is stable at 0.00m, focus on longitudinal distance.
- **TTC**: \( \approx 4.84 \, \text{seconds} \)) suggests low risk as it's greater than 3.0s.

Overall Risk: Low Risk (4)

#### Obstacle 30625 (Left)

- **Adjusted Distances**: Longitudinal = 0.00m, Lateral = 1.95m
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal = -11.93 m/s, Lateral = 0.13 m/s

Trajectory Analysis:
- Obstacle is on the left of the ego with a side-by-side alignment longitudinally.
- Lateral distance decreasing across timesteps.
  
TTC Calculation:
- Longitudinal alignment here indicates no risk there.
- Lateral movement away suggests relative safety on lateral evaluation.

Risk Assessment:
- **MDC**: Surrounding trajectories imply unlikely convergence to below 1m rapidly.
- **TTC for lateral**: Not a closing situation; movement away.

Overall Risk: Medium Risk (3) due to alignment coupled with lateral distance.

#### Obstacle 30626 (Front-Left)

- **Adjusted Distances**: Longitudinal = 10.03m, Lateral = 1.83m
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal = -11.84 m/s, Lateral = 0.01 m/s

Trajectory Analysis:
- Consistent closing in both dimensions with longitudinal reduction clearly observed.
  
TTC Calculation:
- \( \text{TTC}_{long} = \frac{10.03}{11.84} \approx 0.85 \, \text{seconds} \)

Risk Assessment:
- **MDC**: Progressive decrease implies potential intersection soon.
- **TTC**: \( \approx 0.85 \, \text{seconds} \) is indicative of high risk.

Overall Risk: High Risk (2)

---

#### Obstacle 30628 (Behind)

- **Adjusted Distances**: Longitudinal = -0.18m, Lateral = 0.00m
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal = 2.68 m/s, Lateral = -0.15 m/s

Trajectory Analysis:
- Obstacle is concluding to be overtaking from behind.
  
TTC Calculation:
- Given forward position change beyond negative threshold, now more of passing behavior.

Risk Assessment:
- No immediate collision in the immediate future since distance continues to increase, but significant proximity.

Overall Risk: Medium Risk (3) for monitoring due to close proximity but diverging path.

### Conclusion of Analysis

This scenario contains multiple obstacles, notably Obstacle 30626, presenting a risk factor with a TTC that puts the obstacle in High Risk of collision. 

Given the high score combination and approximately closing trajectory with low TTC, **this is not an immediate collision scenario**, but sustained high vigilance is advised for Obstacle 30626.
