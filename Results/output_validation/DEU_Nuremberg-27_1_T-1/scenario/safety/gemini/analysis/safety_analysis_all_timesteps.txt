### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 30623
- Relative Direction: Front
- Distance Risk Reason: DTClong is 16.71m, indicating a safe longitudinal distance. DTClat is 0.00m, representing exact lateral alignment.  The longitudinal distance has been steadily decreasing over the timesteps, while lateral distance remains constant.
- Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 5
- Lateral Distance Safety Score: 5
- Overall Distance Safety Score: 5.0
- Time Risk Reason: TTClong is 4.84s, suggesting ample time to react longitudinally. TTClat is 0.00s, meaning no lateral movement is predicted.  TTClong has been consistently decreasing.
- Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 4
- Lateral Time Safety Score: 5
- Overall Time Safety Score: 4.0
- Overall Risk Score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 30625
- Relative Direction: Left
- Distance Risk Reason: DTClong is 0.00m, indicating a potential longitudinal collision. DTClat is 1.95m, signifying some lateral separation. History shows this obstacle moving closer longitudinally, while the recent lateral movement suggests it might avoid collision.
- Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 0
- Lateral Distance Safety Score: 3
- Overall Distance Safety Score: 3.0
- Time Risk Reason: TTClong is 0.00s, signifying imminent longitudinal collision risk. TTClat is inf, showing no lateral collision risk. TTClong has decreased to 0. The high TTClat suggests a predominantly leftward movement.
- Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 0
- Lateral Time Safety Score: 5
- Overall Time Safety Score: 5.0
- Overall Risk Score: 4
