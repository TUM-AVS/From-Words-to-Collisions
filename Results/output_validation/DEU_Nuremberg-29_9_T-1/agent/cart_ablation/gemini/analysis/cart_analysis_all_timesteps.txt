Analysis:

Obstacle 30785: This obstacle shows a concerning trend. While not currently at extreme risk, it is approaching the ego vehicle with a consistently increasing velocity. Extrapolating its trajectory based on the provided data suggests a high probability of an eventual collision or near miss if current trends continue.  Therefore, it represents a High Risk (2).

Obstacle 30786: This obstacle is stationary and poses no immediate threat. The separation distance is sufficient, and the ego vehicle's trajectory does not indicate a direct path towards it. Thus, it's considered a Negligible Risk (5).

Based on the provided data, the most appropriate risk assessment is a 2 or High Risk due to Obstacle 30785's trajectory.
