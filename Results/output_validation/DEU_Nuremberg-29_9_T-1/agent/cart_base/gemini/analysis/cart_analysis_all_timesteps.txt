Obstacle 30785: This obstacle is moving at a relatively high velocity and accelerating. While its y-coordinate is increasing, indicating movement somewhat away from the ego vehicle, its x-coordinate is also decreasing, suggesting a potential path intersection.  Further, the lane change from 1625 to 268 implies a possible maneuver towards the ego vehicle's general vicinity. Although not immediately colliding, the continuous decrease in distance between the two, combined with the obstacle's speed and acceleration, represents a growing risk that requires monitoring.  This warrants a risk score of 2 (High Risk).

Obstacle 30786: This obstacle is stationary and poses no immediate threat.  The data shows no change in its position, velocity, or acceleration.  Therefore, the risk score is 5 (Negligible Risk).
