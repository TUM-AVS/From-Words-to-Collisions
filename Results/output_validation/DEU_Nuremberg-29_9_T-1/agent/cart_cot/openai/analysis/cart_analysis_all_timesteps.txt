### Analysis:

Upon reviewing the scenario focusing on the most recent timestep at 2.4 seconds, the key is assessing the trajectory of the ego vehicle and the obstacles particularly obstacles ID 30785 and 30786, as they are most relevant in this context.

- **Obstacle 30785**:
  - **Position: (-379.8176, 243.182)**
  - It is moving in a trajectory that increasingly positions it closer to Ego, both horizontally and vertically in terms of Cartesian distance.
  - Velocity is higher than the ego's decreasing velocity, indicating it may catch up.
  - Ego is decelerating, while Obstacle 30785 is accelerating, likely reducing the distance between them faster over time.
  - The TTC (time to collision) is low due to its higher velocity while the Ego decelerates.
  - Given this, Obstacle 30785 poses a significant risk of collision due to its high speed towards the egoâ€™s path combined with ego's deceleration.

- **Obstacle 30786**:
  - **Position: (-395.9438, 228.5852)**
  - It remains static with a velocity of 0.0. 
  - Its location remains unchanged over the examined time steps, thus posing little immediate threat based on trajectory and relative motion.

### Final JSON Output:

```json
{
    "CollisionObstacles": [],
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "30785",
        "OverallRiskScore": 1
    },
    "HighRiskObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "30786",
        "OverallRiskScore": 2
    }
}
```

- **Obstacle 30785** is marked as "ExtremeRiskObstacle" with an Overall Risk Score of 1 due to its high velocity and direction towards the ego vehicle, posing an imminent collision risk as it closes the gap rapidly.

- **Obstacle 30786** is marked as "HighRiskObstacle" with an Overall Risk Score of 2 because, despite its stationary state, its position could potentially cause future path issues depending on dynamic traffic and ego movement patterns, although it isn't in the direct path.
