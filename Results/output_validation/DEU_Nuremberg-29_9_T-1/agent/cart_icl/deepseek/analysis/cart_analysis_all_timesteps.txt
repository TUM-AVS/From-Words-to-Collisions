### Analysis:

1. **Obstacle 30785.0**:
   - **Trajectory**: Moving towards the ego vehicle with increasing velocity (from 10.2845 m/s to 11.7881 m/s) and positive acceleration.
   - **Relative Motion**: The obstacle is ahead of the ego vehicle and moving in a direction that is not directly colliding but is in close proximity.
   - **TTC**: The relative distance is decreasing, but the lateral separation is significant enough to avoid immediate collision.
   - **Risk Assessment**: **Medium Risk (3)** due to the decreasing distance but manageable with current trajectories.

2. **Obstacle 30786.0**:
   - **Trajectory**: Stationary (velocity = 0.0 m/s, acceleration = 0.0 m/sÂ²).
   - **Relative Motion**: The ego vehicle is decelerating and moving towards the stationary obstacle.
   - **TTC**: The distance between the ego and the obstacle is decreasing, but the ego's deceleration suggests it will stop before collision.
   - **Risk Assessment**: **Low Risk (4)** as the ego is slowing down and the obstacle is stationary.
