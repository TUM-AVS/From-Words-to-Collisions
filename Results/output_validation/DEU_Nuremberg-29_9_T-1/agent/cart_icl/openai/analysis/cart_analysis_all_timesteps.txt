### Analysis:

- **Ego Vehicle at 2.4 seconds:**  
  Position: (-399.4494, 224.5553)  
  Velocity: ~4.4101 m/s  
  Acceleration: -2.0372 m/s²  
  Lanelet: 992.0

- **Obstacle 30785 at 2.4 seconds:**  
  Position: (-379.8176, 243.182)  
  Velocity: 11.7881 m/s  
  Acceleration: 2.0012 m/s²  
  Lanelet: 268.0  

  **Risk Analysis:**  
  - Relative motion: The obstacle is approximately 27.6 meters away laterally in an adjacent lane from the ego.  
  - Relative velocity difference: The obstacle is moving faster and in a diverging lane.  
  - TTC and MDC are not critical due to lateral distance and differing lanes.  

  **Risk Level:** 4 (Low Risk)

- **Obstacle 30786 at 2.4 seconds:**  
  Position: (-395.9438, 228.5852)  
  Velocity: 0 m/s (Stationary)  
  Lanelet: 2229.0

  **Risk Analysis:**  
  - Relative position indicates the obstacle is approximately 6.33 meters away longitudinally and 4.0 meters laterally.  
  - The stationary nature implies no relative motion, reducing the risk of collision due to increasing separation over time.

  **Risk Level:** 4 (Low Risk)
