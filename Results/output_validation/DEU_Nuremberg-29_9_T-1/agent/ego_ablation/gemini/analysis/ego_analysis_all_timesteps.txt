At the most recent timestep (2.4 seconds), Obstacle 30785 is moving away from the ego vehicle both longitudinally and laterally. It poses no risk of collision. Obstacle 30786, however, is very close (0.83m) and approaching with a negative relative longitudinal velocity.  This represents a very high risk of collision.

Based on the MDC (0.83m), Obstacle 30786 receives a score of 2 (High Risk). Calculating the exact TTC is difficult without precise velocity information, but given the proximity and closing speed, it's likely less than 1 second, which would put it in the Extreme Risk (1) category.  However, since we must rely on the provided thresholds and metrics, we will classify it as High Risk (2) based on MDC.
