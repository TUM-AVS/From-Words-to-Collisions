### Safety analysis for timestep 2.4s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

**Assumptions and Calculations:**

Since the provided scenario description lacks vehicle dimensions and precise lateral positions (only stating "Front," "Front-right," etc.), we will make reasonable assumptions for demonstration purposes.  We'll assume a vehicle width of 2 meters and length of 4 meters.  "Exact lateral alignment" will be treated as if the obstacle's center is directly in front of the ego vehicle's center.  Without precise lateral positions, accurate lateral TTC and MDC cannot be calculated.

**Obstacle 30785:**

At t=2.4s:
- Distance Longitudinal (DTClong): 22.39m
- Distance Lateral (DTClat): 22.39m 
- Relative Velocity Longitudinal (Vrel_long): 6.51 m/s (moving away)
- Relative Velocity Lateral (Vrel_lat): -4.44 m/s (moving away)

- **Distance Risk reason**: Obstacle 30785 is far away from the ego vehicle, both longitudinally and laterally.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: Due to increasing longitudinal and lateral distances, TTC is high.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

**Obstacle 30786:**

At t=2.4s:
- Distance Longitudinal (DTClong): 0.83m
- Distance Lateral (DTClat): 0.83m
- Relative Velocity Longitudinal (Vrel_long): -4.41 m/s (approaching)
- Relative Velocity Lateral (Vrel_lat): 0 m/s

- **Distance Risk reason**:  Obstacle 30786 is extremely close to the ego vehicle longitudinally. Lateral distance is also very small. Although the scenario doesn't explicitly state a collision, the small distance and negative closing velocity are indicative of an imminent collision within the next timestep (or very shortly after).
- **Distance safety score**: 1 (Assumed imminent collision based on trajectory)
- **Time Risk reason**: With a closing velocity of -4.41 m/s and a distance of 0.83m, the TTC is approximately 0.19 seconds.
- **Time safety score**: 1
- **Overall Risk score**: 1



### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID:** 30785
- **Distance Risk reason:**  Far from ego vehicle.
- **Distance safety score:** 5
- **Time Risk reason:** Moving away from ego vehicle.
- **Time safety score:** 5
- **Overall Risk score:** 5

- **Obstacle ID:** 30786
- **Distance Risk reason:** Extremely close and approaching rapidly.  
- **Distance safety score:** 1
- **Time Risk reason:** Very low TTC (< 0.2s), indicating imminent collision.
- **Time safety score:** 1
- **Overall Risk score:** 1
