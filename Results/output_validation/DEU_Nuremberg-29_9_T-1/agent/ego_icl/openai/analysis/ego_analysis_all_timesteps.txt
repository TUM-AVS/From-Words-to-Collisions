Based on the scenario context and focusing on the most recent timestep:

### Obstacle 30785 (Front-right of the ego car, most recent timestep at 2.4 seconds)
- **Trajectory Analysis:** Over the recorded time intervals, this obstacle has shown a consistent pattern of moving away from the ego vehicle both longitudinally and laterally.
- **Adjusted Distances at 2.4s:** 
  - Longitudinal: 22.39 m
  - Lateral: -1.33 m
- **Velocities:**
  - Longitudinal Velocity: 6.51 m/s (moving away)
  - Lateral Velocity: -4.44 m/s (moving away to the right)
- **Time-to-Collision (TTC):** Not applicable as both longitudinal and lateral velocities indicate that the obstacle is moving away from the ego vehicle.
- **Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC):** Given the increasing distances and velocities moving apart, MDC is far above the no-risk threshold.
- **Risk Assessment:** Based on the movement pattern and increasing distances, Obstacle 30785 poses a negligible risk. The relative motion is clearly moving away from the ego vehicle, thus indicating no significant collision threat.

### Obstacle 30786 (Front of the ego car, most recent timestep at 2.4 seconds)
- **Trajectory Analysis:** Over the recorded time intervals, this obstacle has continuously approached the ego vehicle with decreasing longitudinal distances.
- **Adjusted Distances at 2.4s:** 
  - Longitudinal: 0.83 m
  - Lateral: 0.00 m
- **Velocities:**
  - Longitudinal Velocity: -4.41 m/s (approaching)
  - Lateral Velocity: -0.00 m/s (aligned in the same lane)
- **Time-to-Collision (TTC):**
  - TTC = 0.83 m / 4.41 m/s = 0.19 seconds
  - This indicates a very immediate collision likelihood due to rapid closing velocity and very short distance.
- **Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC):** The adjusted longitudinal distance is nearing collision (0.83 m), and given the negative, approaching velocity, MDC is very low.
- **Risk Assessment:** With a TTC under 0.5 seconds and an extreme convergence in the same lane, this obstacle is at extreme risk of collision and requires immediate action to avoid physical contact. The risk score is 1, indicating extreme risk.

**Final Note on Summary:** The risk assessment clearly identifies Obstacle 30786 as posing the most significant threat due to its imminent collision course directly in the front of the ego vehicle, while Obstacle 30785 presents no collision risk given its diverging path and increasing distance from the ego vehicle.
