At t=2.6s, Ego is at (-398.8776, 225.2258) with a velocity of 3.5673 m/s and decelerating at -2.1349 m/s².

Obstacle 30785 is at (-377.6901, 244.3007), velocity 12.1585 m/s, accelerating at 1.8145 m/s².  This obstacle is moving away from the Ego vehicle and poses no immediate threat.

Obstacle 30786 is stationary at (-395.9438, 228.5852). The y-coordinates are close, suggesting potential risk.  The x-coordinate difference is approximately -395.9438 - (-398.8776) = 2.9338 meters. While the ego vehicle is decelerating, the x-difference is not decreasing rapidly and thus a collision with obstacle 30786 is unlikely in the immediate future.  Given the current trajectories, this is assessed as a medium risk (3).

Therefore, no obstacle presents an extreme or collision risk.
