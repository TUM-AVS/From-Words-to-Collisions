At t=2.6s, Ego is at (-398.8776, 225.2258) and decelerating.

Obstacle 30785 is at (-377.6901, 244.3007) and accelerating.  While the y-coordinates suggest some separation, the x-coordinates are getting closer with each timestep. Given the acceleration difference, a collision is likely in the very near future. This warrants an "Extreme Risk" assessment.

Obstacle 30786 is stationary at (-395.9438, 228.5852).  The distance between Ego and this obstacle is decreasing but the rate is slow enough that it's not an immediate concern compared to obstacle 30785. It poses a "Medium Risk" currently.
