### Safety Analysis for the Most Recent Timestep (2.6 seconds):

#### Obstacle Analysis:
1. **Obstacle ID: 30782.0**
   - **Distance Risk Reason**: Moving towards ego but at a safe lateral distance (~28m). Trajectory shows consistent movement away from ego's path.
   - **Distance Safety Score**: 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Time Risk Reason**: High velocity (11.96 m/s) but diverging path. TTC is high due to lateral separation.
   - **Time Safety Score**: 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Overall Risk Score**: 4

2. **Obstacle ID: 30783.0**
   - **Distance Risk Reason**: Moving parallel to ego at ~35m lateral distance. No convergence in trajectory.
   - **Distance Safety Score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Time Risk Reason**: High speed (13.58 m/s) but moving away from ego's lane.
   - **Time Safety Score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Overall Risk Score**: 5

3. **Obstacle ID: 30785.0**
   - **Distance Risk Reason**: ~21m lateral distance, moving parallel with slight convergence. Ego is decelerating faster.
   - **Distance Safety Score**: 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Time Risk Reason**: Speed (12.16 m/s) higher than ego, but lateral separation remains stable.
   - **Time Safety Score**: 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Overall Risk Score**: 4

4. **Obstacle ID: 30786.0**
   - **Distance Risk Reason**: Static obstacle at ~3m lateral distance. Ego is moving away.
   - **Distance Safety Score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Time Risk Reason**: Zero velocity. No collision risk.
   - **Time Safety Score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Overall Risk Score**: 5

5. **Obstacle ID: 30788.0**
   - **Distance Risk Reason**: Static obstacle at ~32m lateral distance. No movement.
   - **Distance Safety Score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Time Risk Reason**: Zero velocity. No collision risk.
   - **Time Safety Score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Overall Risk Score**: 5

6. **Obstacle ID: 30789.0**
   - **Distance Risk Reason**: Moving towards ego but lateral distance (~34m) is increasing.
   - **Distance Safety Score**: 4 (Low Risk)

   - **Time Risk Reason**: Speed (6.22 m/s) and decelerating. No convergence.
   - **Time Safety Score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Overall Risk Score**: 5

8. **Obstacle ID: 30792.0**
   - **Distance Risk Reason**: Moving away (~52m lateral distance).
   - **Distance Safety Score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Time Risk Reason**: High speed (11.39 m/s) but diverging path.
   - **Time Safety Score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Overall Risk Score**: 5

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. **Ego Behavior**: Ego is decelerating sharply (3.57 m/s, -2.13 m/sÂ²), reducing collision risk.
2. **Obstacle Trajectories**: All obstacles are either static, moving away, or have sufficient lateral separation.
3. **Critical Obstacles**: None show convergence with ego's path. Closest (30786.0) is static and being passed safely.
4. **Conclusion**: No collision or extreme risk scenarios detected.
