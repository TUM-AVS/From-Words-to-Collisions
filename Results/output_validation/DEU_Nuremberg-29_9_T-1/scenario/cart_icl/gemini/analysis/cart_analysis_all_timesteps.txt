### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 30785.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is relatively far from the ego vehicle and moving further away.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason:  Relative velocities and trajectories indicate no imminent collision risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 30786.0
- Distance Risk reason: Although obstacle is stationary and relatively close, the ego vehicle's trajectory and decreasing speed suggest reducing risk. Lateral separation is significant.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason:  Ego vehicle is decelerating and appears to be maintaining a safe lateral distance. Stationary obstacle poses minimal time-related risk.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4


### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. At the last timestep, no obstacle occupies the same lanelet as the ego vehicle (992.0).
2. Obstacle 30785.0 is in lanelet 268.0 and moving further away from the ego vehicle in both X and Y coordinates. It presents no collision risk.
3. Obstacle 30786.0 is stationary in lanelet 2229.0.  While relatively close, the ego vehicle's trajectory and deceleration suggest it will maintain a safe distance. No immediate collision is predicted. 

Therefore, this is not a collision scenario.
