### Obstacle Analysis for the Most Recent Timestep (2.6 seconds):
1. **Ego Vehicle:** 
   - Position: (-398.8776, 225.2258)
   - Orientation: 0.8624
   - Velocity: 3.5673
   - Lanelet: 992.0

2. **Obstacle 30785.0:**
   - Position: (-377.6901, 244.3007)
   - Orientation: 0.4847
   - Velocity: 12.1585
   - Lanelet: 268.0

   **Risk Assessment:**
   - **Distance Risk Reasoning:** 
     - The obstacle is consistently moving at a high speed, away from the ego vehicle on a different trajectory. There is no convergence of paths over the last 9 timesteps.
     - **Distance Safety Score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Time Risk Reasoning:** 
     - The obstacle's velocity and acceleration patterns indicate it is moving away from the ego vehicle. 
     - **Time Safety Score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Overall Risk Score:** 5

3. **Obstacle 30786.0:**
   - Position: (-395.9438, 228.5852)
   - Orientation: 0.8479
   - Velocity: 0.0
   - Lanelet: 2229.0

   **Risk Assessment:**
   - **Distance Risk Reasoning:** 
     - This obstacle remains stationary over all timesteps. It is slightly ahead of the ego vehicle, which is decelerating and unlikely to reach the obstacleâ€™s position given its stopping trajectory.
     - **Distance Safety Score:** 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Time Risk Reasoning:** 
     - Since the ego vehicle is decelerating, it reduces any potential risk of collision. The stationary nature of the obstacle further lessens the risk.
     - **Time Safety Score:** 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Overall Risk Score:** 4

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
- **Collision Scenario Assessment:**
  - Obstacle 30785.0 poses no risk due to its divergent trajectory and higher speed moving away from the ego.
  - Obstacle 30786.0 is stationary, and while it is ahead, the decreasing speed of the ego vehicle suggests it will not be reached imminently.
