### Safety analysis for timestep 1.7s - 2.6s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

Obstacle 30785 consistently maintains a safe distance and is moving away from the ego vehicle both longitudinally and laterally throughout the entire duration. Therefore, it poses no collision risk.

Obstacle 30786, however, presents a clear collision risk. It is approaching the ego vehicle longitudinally, with the lateral distance also decreasing proportionally, indicating a head-on or near head-on collision course.  The relative longitudinal velocity is negative and increasing in magnitude, while the distance continuously shrinks, resulting in a very low TTC.  The collision is confirmed at t=2.6s.

### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID:** 30785
- **Distance Risk reason:**  Large longitudinal and lateral distances ( > 19.89m) and increasing, located in front-right and moving away from the ego vehicle.
- **Distance safety score:** 5
- **Time Risk reason:**  No risk of collision as it's moving away from the ego vehicle.
- **Time safety score:** 5
- **Overall Risk score:** 5

- **Obstacle ID:** 30786
- **Distance Risk reason:**  Initially at 5.6m and decreasing longitudinal and lateral distance, located in front, with an "exact lateral alignment," indicating a likely head-on collision course.
- **Distance safety score:**  Scores decrease from 2 to 0 as distance decreases.
- **Time Risk reason:**  Negative longitudinal velocity and decreasing distance lead to a very short TTC, indicating imminent collision.
- **Time safety score:** Scores decrease from 1 to 0 as TTC decreases.
- **Overall Risk score:** Starts at 1 (Extreme Risk) at t=1.7s and reaches 0 (Collision) at t=2.6s.
