### Obstacle-by-Obstacle Analysis

#### **Obstacle 30785 (Front-Right)**
- **Latest Timestep (2.6s):**
  - Longitudinal Distance: 23.76 m (moving away)
  - Lateral Distance: -2.07 m (moving right, away from ego)
  - Relative Velocity: Longitudinal 7.73 m/s (away), Lateral -4.48 m/s (away)
  - Motion: Moving away both longitudinally and laterally.

**Risk Assessment:**
- **MDC (Minimum Distance to Collision):** Increasing in both dimensions (no convergence).
- **TTC (Time-to-Collision):** Not applicable (diverging paths).
- **Overall Risk:** **5 (No Risk)** – No collision path exists.

#### **Obstacle 30786 (Front → Collision)**
- **Latest Timestep (2.6s):**
  - Longitudinal Distance: **0.00 m** (collision occurred).
  - Lateral Distance: **0.00 m** (collision occurred).
  - Relative Velocity: Longitudinal -3.57 m/s (still approaching at impact).
  - Motion: **Exact longitudinal and lateral alignment** (collision confirmed).

**Risk Assessment:**
- **MDC:** **0.00 m** (collision in both dimensions).
- **TTC:** **0.00 s** (collision occurring).
- **Overall Risk:** **0 (Collision)** – Direct collision confirmed.

---

### Trajectory Analysis
- **Obstacle 30785:** Consistently moving away from the ego vehicle (longitudinally and laterally). No risk of collision.
- **Obstacle 30786:** 
  - Progressively closed longitudinal distance from 5.60 m (1.7s) to **0.00 m (2.6s)**.
  - Maintained **0.00 m lateral alignment** (same lane).
  - Collision unavoidable due to high closing speed (-3.57 m/s at impact).

---

### Final Determination
This is a **collision scenario** because **Obstacle 30786** has:
1. **Collision Risk Score = 0** (actual collision at 2.6s).
2. **0.00 m distance in both dimensions** with ongoing closing velocity.
