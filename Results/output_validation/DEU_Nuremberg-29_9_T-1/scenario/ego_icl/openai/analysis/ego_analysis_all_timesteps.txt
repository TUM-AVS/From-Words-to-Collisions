### Obstacle-by-Obstacle Analysis

#### Analysis of Obstacle 30785:
- **Position and Motion Description**: At the latest timestamp (2.6 seconds), Obstacle 30785 is in the Front-right of the ego car with longitudinal distance 23.76 m and lateral distance -2.07 m (adjusted distances are not provided here but assumed to be similarly large, thus focusing on large raw distances).
- **Relative Velocities**: Longitudinal velocity is 7.73 m/s (moving away longitudinally) and lateral velocity is -4.48 m/s (moving away to the right).
- **Trajectory**: Over the timesteps, Obstacle 30785 is consistently moving away in both dimensions. The lateral distance is increasing as the obstacle moves further right.
- **TTC and MDC Calculation**:
  - **TTC Longitudinal**: Not applicable as the obstacle is moving away.
  - **MDC**: Based on front-right positioning over time, predictions indicate increasing separation, hence MDC > 5.0 m.
- **Risk Assessment**: With increasing separation in both dimensions, the risk score is `5 (No Risk)`.

#### Analysis of Obstacle 30786:
- **Position and Motion Description**: At the latest timestamp (2.6 seconds), Obstacle 30786 is at a collision position (longitudinal 0.00 m and lateral 0.00 m) indicating immediate contact with the ego car.
- **Relative Velocities**: Longitudinal velocity is -3.57 m/s (indicating a closing trajectory) and lateral velocity is 0.00 m/s.
- **Trajectory**: This obstacle has been consistently closing towards the ego car over previous timesteps.
- **TTC and MDC Calculation**:
  - **TTC Longitudinal**: Already at 0.00 m, collision has occurred.
  - **MDC**: 0 meters, as both longitudinal and lateral distances are aligned to zero at this point.
- **Risk Assessment**: Collision is occurring, risk score is `0 (Collision)`.

### Conclusion
- **Collision Scenario**: With Obstacle 30786 in a collision position with the ego vehicle, this situation is unequivocally a collision scenario.
