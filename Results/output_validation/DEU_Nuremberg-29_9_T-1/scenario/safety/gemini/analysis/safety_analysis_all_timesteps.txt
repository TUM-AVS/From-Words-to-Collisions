### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
    - Obstacle ID: 30785
    - Relative Direction: Front-right
    - Distance Risk Reason: DTClong is > 5 and DTClat is >5, indicating negligible longitudinal and lateral risk. The obstacle has consistently moved away from the ego vehicle both longitudinally and laterally over the past timesteps.
    - Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 5
    - Lateral Distance Safety Score: 5
    - Overall Distance Safety Score: 5.0
    - Time Risk Reason: Both TTClong and TTClat are inf, showing no risk of collision in the foreseeable future. This aligns with the obstacle's motion, moving away from the ego vehicle.
    - Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 5
    - Lateral Time Safety Score: 5
    - Overall Time Safety Score: 5.0
    - Overall Risk Score: 5

    - Obstacle ID: 30786
    - Relative Direction: Front
    - Distance Risk Reason: DTClong is 0.00 m indicating a collision. This obstacle has been consistently approaching the ego vehicle longitudinally over the previous timesteps, with DTClong decreasing steadily. 
    - Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 0
    - Lateral Distance Safety Score: 5
    - Overall Distance Safety Score: 0.0
    - Time Risk Reason: TTClong is 0.00 indicating a collision.  TTClat is 0.00, with no lateral movement detected. This trend of decreasing TTClong over previous timesteps clearly pointed towards an impending longitudinal collision.
    - Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 0
    - Lateral Time Safety Score: 0
    - Overall Time Safety Score: 0.0
    - Overall Risk Score: 0
