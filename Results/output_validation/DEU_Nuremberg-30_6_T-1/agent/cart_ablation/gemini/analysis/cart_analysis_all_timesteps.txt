Analysis:

Obstacle 30603: This obstacle is consistently located in a different lanelet (476) than the ego vehicle (1804). While the x-coordinate of this obstacle remains relatively close to the ego vehicle's x-coordinate, the y-coordinate shows a consistent and substantial separation. Furthermore, the obstacle's velocity is decreasing over time.  Given the lane separation and the diverging trajectories, the risk of collision is negligible. Risk score: 5

Obstacle 30604:  This obstacle starts in lanelet 451 and transitions to lanelet 1773.  Its y-coordinate is consistently separated from the ego vehicle, but its x-coordinate is approaching the ego vehicle's x-coordinate quickly due to its high velocity. Although a direct collision isn't observed in the provided timesteps, the high velocity and closing distance of obstacle 30604, coupled with the lane change, represent a potential developing risk that warrants further investigation. If the current trajectories continue, a collision is possible in the near future after the given timeframe.  A predictive risk assessment would classify this as a potential extreme risk. Risk score: 2, but predictively 1.
