Obstacle 30603: This obstacle is consistently located on lanelet 476, while the ego vehicle is on lanelet 1804.  The x-coordinates of both are very close, but the y-coordinate difference (around 12-13 meters) suggests they are in parallel lanes. While 30603 is decelerating and eventually comes close to stopping, the consistent separation in the y-coordinate and different lanelets suggests no immediate collision risk.  Risk score: 4 (Low Risk).

Obstacle 30604: This obstacle starts on lanelet 451 and then transitions to lanelet 1773.  It has a high velocity (around 9 m/s) and its y-coordinate is closer to the ego vehicle's than obstacle 30603.  Importantly, the data shows 30604 is approaching the ego vehicle. While the data doesn't provide information on lanelet geometry or relative headings to definitively conclude a collision, the high velocity and closing distance raise serious concerns, demanding close monitoring.  Given the limited information, it is appropriate to classify this as a potential high risk. Risk Score: 2 (High Risk).
