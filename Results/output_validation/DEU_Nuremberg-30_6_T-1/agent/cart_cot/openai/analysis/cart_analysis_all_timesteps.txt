In this scenario, at the most recent timestep (5.2 seconds), we observe the following:

- **Ego Vehicle (30602.0)**: The vehicle comes to a complete stop at position (356.6766, -62.3442) with velocity and acceleration both at 0. It remains within lanelet 1804.0.

- **Obstacle 30603.0**: This obstacle is moving at a slower velocity, decreasing from 0.5109 to 0.2123 from 4.3 to 5.2 seconds, located at (356.644, -49.9067) and also decelerating. Its trajectory relative to the Ego is more or less parallel, with reasonable distance. No significant risk appears present.

- **Obstacle 30604.0**: Shows ongoing motion with a velocity of 8.1875 and a deceleration pattern different from its prior acceleration, located at (355.4832, -67.2542). It is notable for being in a different lanelet (1773.0), suggesting a greater separation and thus less immediate risk to the Ego.

### Risk Evaluation:
- **Obstacle 30603.0** has a low relative velocity compared to the Ego (which is stopped) and consistent lane positioning. It lies about 12.4375 units vertically apart from the ego position. This does not suggest high risk either in direction or velocity. It can be scored with Negligible Risk (5).
- **Obstacle 30604.0** moves relatively fast but is decreasing towards the Ego from a different trajectory path, persisting ~5.09 units horizontally and about 5.089 units vertically when considering lane separation. Considering its high speed and potential trajectory overlap if not accounted for timely, it pushes towards a Low Risk (4), because of lane change but manageable trajectory divergence.

Overall, no obstacle signifies imminent collision (risk level 0 or 1), as there is significant spatial and directional separation, and their vectors suggest decreased immediate threats.
