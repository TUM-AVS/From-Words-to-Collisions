### Analysis of the Scenario:

1. **Obstacle 30603.0**:
   - **Position**: (356.644, -49.9067) at 5.2s, moving towards the ego vehicle.
   - **Relative Motion**: The obstacle is ahead of the ego vehicle in the longitudinal direction (y-coordinate difference: ~12.44m) and moving towards it with a decreasing velocity (0.2123 m/s at 5.2s).
   - **TTC**: The relative velocity is low, and the distance is significant. The TTC is high, indicating no immediate collision risk.
   - **Risk Assessment**: **Low Risk (4)**.

2. **Obstacle 30604.0**:
   - **Position**: (355.4832, -67.2542) at 5.2s, moving towards the ego vehicle.
   - **Relative Motion**: The obstacle is behind the ego vehicle in the longitudinal direction (y-coordinate difference: ~-4.91m) and moving towards it with a high velocity (8.1875 m/s at 5.2s).
   - **TTC**: The relative velocity is high, and the distance is closing rapidly. The TTC is low, indicating a potential collision risk.
   - **Risk Assessment**: **High Risk (2)**.

3. **Ego Vehicle**:
   - **Position**: (356.6766, -62.3442) at 5.2s, stationary (velocity and acceleration are 0).
   - **Behavior**: The ego vehicle has come to a complete stop, which reduces the risk of collision but does not eliminate it if other obstacles are moving towards it.
