At timestep 5.2s, Ego is stationary (velocity and acceleration are 0).

Obstacle 30603 is moving slowly (0.2123 m/s) towards Ego, but the lateral distance is significant (~12.5m) and it's decelerating.  This poses a low risk in the short term.

Obstacle 30604, however, is traveling at 8.1875 m/s and changed lanes in the previous timesteps, moving towards the Ego's lane. It also exhibits fluctuating acceleration but remains high. Combining its high speed, lane change maneuver, and proximity in the Y-axis (lateral position) suggests a potential collision course with the stationary Ego. Although the lateral distance is still somewhat significant, the high speed of 30604 means the situation could deteriorate rapidly. Therefore, Obstacle 30604 represents a high risk.
