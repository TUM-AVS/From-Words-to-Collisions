### Risk Assessment

**Ego Vehicle at 5.2 seconds:**
- Position: (356.6766, -62.3442)
- Velocity: 0.0 m/s (stopped)

**Obstacle 30603 at 5.2 seconds:**
- Position: (356.644, -49.9067)
- Increasing separation compared to earlier timesteps.
- Velocity: 0.2123 m/s, decelerating.
- Lateral distance: ≈12.4 meters.
  
**Obstacle 30604 at 5.2 seconds:**
- Position: (355.4832, -67.2542)
- Moving in a different direction from the Ego.
- Velocity: 8.1875 m/s, slight deceleration.
- Lateral distance: ≈5 meters, trajectory is not leading towards Ego.

### Evaluation

For both obstacles:
- **Obstacle 30603** is moving away laterally and has a low relative velocity. The lateral separation is significant, and with both Ego and Obstacle 30603 having low velocities, there is no immediate collision threat.
- **Obstacle 30604** continues to separate due to Ego being stationary and the obstacle moving at higher speeds. The trajectory does not indicate imminent collision risk.

### Conclusion
Based on the positions, velocities, and trajectories at the final timestep:

- **TTC and MDC analysis:**
  - Obstacle 30603: Lateral distance and separation trend indicate no immediate or extreme risk.
  - Obstacle 30604: Separation in Y-direction is increasing, with no intersection trajectory.
  
Both obstacles do not pose significant risks in terms of immediate collision or extreme risk.
  
Ensuring safety should continue with monitoring these trends, but current analyses present negligible risks.
