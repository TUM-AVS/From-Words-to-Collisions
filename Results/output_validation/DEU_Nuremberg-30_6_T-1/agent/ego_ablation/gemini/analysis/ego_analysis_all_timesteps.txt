At the most recent timestamp (5.2 seconds), two obstacles present potential risks:

**Obstacle 30603:** Located to the left of the ego vehicle, with a lateral distance of 10.83 meters.  The longitudinal distance is 0 m and the longitudinal relative velocity is also 0 m/s. Although laterally moving towards the ego vehicle (-0.21 m/s), the substantial lateral distance suggests ample time to react.  This obstacle poses no immediate collision risk. Given the lateral distance, relative velocity, and lack of longitudinal movement, Proximity (5), MDC (5), TTC (5) scores are assigned, which correspond to a negligible risk.

**Obstacle 30604:** Located to the right of the ego vehicle at a lateral distance of -3.30 meters. The longitudinal distance is 0 and has a high longitudinal velocity of 7.39 m/s and lateral velocity of 3.52 m/s, indicating it is moving away from the ego vehicle longitudinally, making a collision unlikely. Laterally, the obstacle is moving toward the ego vehicle. The combination of lateral movement and a relatively small lateral distance suggests a higher risk than obstacle 30603. Considering the provided context, Proximity (2), MDC (3), TTC (3) scores are assigned, resulting in a medium risk level.
