At the most recent timestep (5.2 seconds):

* **Obstacle 30603:** This obstacle is now to the Left of the ego vehicle with a lateral distance of 10.83m.  While it's approaching laterally (-0.21 m/s), the longitudinal alignment (0.00 m) suggests it has already been passed by the ego vehicle. This situation doesn't present an immediate collision risk. The risk level is assessed as **Low (4)**.

* **Obstacle 30604:** This obstacle is to the Right of the ego vehicle with a lateral distance of -3.30m. It exhibits exact longitudinal alignment (0.00m) with the ego vehicle.  The high longitudinal velocity (7.39 m/s) indicates it is rapidly overtaking the ego vehicle. Combined with the lateral distance, this presents a very high risk of collision. The risk level is assessed as **Extreme (1)**.

0: Collision - Physical contact occurred or unavoidable
1: Extreme Risk - Immediate collision likely
2: High Risk - Close to collision, needs quick action
3: Medium Risk - Manageable with proper reaction
4: Low Risk - Minimal risk, sufficient time to react
5: Negligible Risk - No significant risk
