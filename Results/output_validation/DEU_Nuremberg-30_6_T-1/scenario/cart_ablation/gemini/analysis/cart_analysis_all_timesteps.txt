At the most recent timestep (5.4 seconds), Ego is stationary at (356.6766, -62.3442).

Obstacle 30603 is at (356.6433, -49.9441) and moving slowly.  The y-coordinate difference is significant, and the x-coordinate difference is minimal, meaning a collision is unlikely. It represents a low risk.

Obstacle 30604 is at (356.7501, -66.4002) and moving with a speed of 8.1859. The x-coordinate difference is very small (0.0735). The y-coordinate difference is -3.056.  Given Obstacle 30604's speed and trajectory, a collision with Ego is highly probable in the next time step.  

Therefore, Obstacle 30604 poses an extreme risk.
