Obstacle 30604 is in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle at the last timestep (1804.0).  Its position (356.7501, -66.4002) is very close to the ego's (356.6766, -62.3442), indicating a very high probability of collision.  The rapid change in obstacle 30604's orientation over the preceding timesteps, combined with its high velocity and fluctuating acceleration, further suggests erratic movement that increases collision risk.
