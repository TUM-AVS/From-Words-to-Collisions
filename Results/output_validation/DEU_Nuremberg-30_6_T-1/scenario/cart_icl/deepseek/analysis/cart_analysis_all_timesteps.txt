### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep (5.4 seconds):

### Obstacle Analysis:
1. **Obstacle ID: 30601.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Moving away from ego in the positive Y-direction (from -28.9966 to -21.6683 over 1.0s). Distance is increasing.
   - **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: High velocity (8.1279) but moving away. No convergence in trajectory.
   - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 5

2. **Obstacle ID: 30603.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Slowly approaching ego in Y-direction (from -49.6987 to -49.9441 over 1.0s). Minimal distance change (~0.25m).
   - **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: Low velocity (0.1719) and decelerating. No immediate threat.
   - **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 4

3. **Obstacle ID: 30604.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Now in same lanelet (1804.0) as ego. Rapidly closing distance in Y-direction (from -68.4828 to -66.4002 over 1.0s).
   - **Distance safety score**: 2 (High Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: High velocity (8.1859) with erratic acceleration. Projected to pass close to ego.
   - **Time safety score**: 2 (High Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 2

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. Ego is stationary (velocity=0) at (356.6766, -62.3442).
2. Obstacle 30601.0 is moving away - no risk.
3. Obstacle 30603.0 is nearly stationary - minimal risk.
4. Obstacle 30604.0 entered ego's lanelet with high speed but current trajectory shows it will pass behind ego (Y-coordinate increasing). Close proximity warrants high risk rating but no immediate collision.
