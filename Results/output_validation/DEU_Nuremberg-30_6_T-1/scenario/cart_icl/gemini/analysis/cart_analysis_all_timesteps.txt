### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 30603.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is laterally separated and poses no immediate risk, consistent over past timesteps.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason:  Relative velocities and accelerations suggest no imminent collision threat.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 30604.0
- Distance Risk reason: Although in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle, the obstacle is ahead and moving away.  Past trajectory confirms this movement.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: The relative velocity and acceleration trends over time suggest no collision risk.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4


### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. At the last timestep (5.4s), the ego vehicle is stationary.
2. Obstacle 30603.0 is laterally separated and presents no risk throughout the entire provided timeframe.
3. Obstacle 30604.0, while in the same lanelet at the final timestep, is moving away from the ego vehicle.  Its past trajectory indicates a consistent separation pattern.
4. No collision is observed or predicted based on the data.
