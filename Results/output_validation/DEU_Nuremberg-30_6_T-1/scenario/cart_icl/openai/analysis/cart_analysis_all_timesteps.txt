### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:
- **Obstacle ID: 30603**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: This obstacle is in a different lanelet from the ego vehicle and moving parallel but at a slower velocity, maintaining a consistent lateral separation. The distance is increasing slightly over time.
  - **Distance safety score**: 5
  - **Time Risk reason**: Given its slow and decelerating velocity, its path does not suggest an imminent risk of collision. Historical analysis shows continued separation with the ego vehicle.
  - **Time safety score**: 5
  - **Overall Risk score**: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 30604**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: This obstacle has entered the same lanelet as the ego vehicle. It is moving along a trajectory that is parallel to and converging with the ego vehicle's position, decreasing lateral distance over time.
  - **Distance safety score**: 1
  - **Time Risk reason**: The obstacle maintains a high velocity with moderate negative and sometimes positive acceleration, suggesting rapid approach towards the ego vehicle. The last position is very close, indicating potential for immediate collision.
  - **Time safety score**: 1
  - **Overall Risk score**: 1

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. The ego vehicle remains mostly stationary with negligible velocity, while Obstacle 30603 maintains parallel movement without posing a collision threat due to its lanelet and velocity.
2. Obstacle 30604, showing a fast and converging trajectory towards the ego vehicle, transitions into the same lanelet indicating a convergence path which leads to an extreme collision risk.
3. Historical data shows Obstacle 30604 has been accelerating towards the ego with significant velocity, emphasizing the high risk of collision in the immediate future.
