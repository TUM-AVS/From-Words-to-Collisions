Obstacle 30604 is at high risk of collision. It is only 2.45 meters lateral distance to the right of the ego vehicle. Though the longitudinal velocity is high and it moves away from the ego car longitudinally, the lateral distance and the lateral velocity approaching the ego car indicate a potential side collision if the vehicles maintain their current trajectories.

Obstacle 30603 is at low risk. It is longitudinally aligned with the ego vehicle and located 10.79m to the left. The lateral velocity indicates it is slowly moving towards the ego vehicle, but the large lateral distance provides ample time and space for the ego vehicle to react if necessary.

    "Reasoning": "No collision has occurred. Obstacle 30604 presents a high risk due to its close lateral proximity (2.45m) and lateral velocity towards the ego vehicle, but a collision is not imminent in the next timestep. Obstacle 30603 is at low risk due to larger lateral distance."
