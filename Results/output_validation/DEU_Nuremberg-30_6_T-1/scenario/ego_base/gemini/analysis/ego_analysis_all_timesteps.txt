At time 5.4 seconds, Obstacle 30603 is to the left of the ego vehicle, with a lateral distance of 10.79 meters.  Obstacle 30604 is to the right of the ego vehicle, with a lateral distance of 2.45 meters.  While Obstacle 30604 is considerably closer laterally, it is moving away longitudinally at 6.54 m/s.  Given this speed and the small time window considered here, a collision is not imminent within the next timestep.  However, Obstacle 30604 still represents a high risk due to its proximity and lateral movement towards the ego car (4.93 m/s).

**Risk Levels and Definitions:**
<Collision (Score: 0)>: Actual collision has occurred or is unavoidable within the next timestep.
<Extreme Risk (Score: 1)>: Immediate collision or very high likelihood of impact. Urgent action is required.
<High Risk (Score: 2)>: Close to collision or highly probable collision path. Needs prompt attention and quick manoeuvring.
<Medium Risk (Score: 3)>: Moderate collision risk but manageable with timely reactions and proper strategies.
<Low Risk (Score: 4)>: Minimal collision risk. The situation is controllable with sufficient time to react.
<Negligible Risk (Score: 5)>: No significant collision risk. Obstacles are either moving away or far enough not to interfere.
