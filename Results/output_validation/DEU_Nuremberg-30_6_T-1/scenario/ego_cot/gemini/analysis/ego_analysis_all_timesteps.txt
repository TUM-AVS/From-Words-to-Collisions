### Safety analysis for timestep 4.5s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 30603
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is at a safe distance behind and to the left of the ego vehicle.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason:  The obstacle's slow relative longitudinal and lateral velocities suggest a low risk of collision in the near future.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- Obstacle ID: 30604
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is very close to the ego vehicle in the front-right.
- Distance safety score: 2
- Time Risk reason: While moving away longitudinally, the high lateral relative velocity indicates a high risk of lateral collision.
- Time safety score: 2
- Overall Risk score: 2


### Safety analysis for timestep 4.6s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:

- Time Risk reason: The obstacle's slow relative longitudinal and lateral velocities suggest a low risk of collision in the near future.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- Obstacle ID: 30604
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is very close to the ego vehicle in the front-right.
- Distance safety score: 2
- Time Risk reason: While moving away longitudinally, the high lateral relative velocity indicates a high risk of lateral collision.
- Time safety score: 2
- Overall Risk score: 2



### Safety analysis for timestep 4.7s - 5.1s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 30603
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is at a safe distance behind and to the left of the ego vehicle (initially). The distance gradually decreases.
- Distance safety score: 4 (transitions to 3, then 2 as the distance closes)
- Time Risk reason: The obstacle's slow relative longitudinal and lateral velocities initially suggest a low risk, but the decreasing distance increases the risk over time.
- Time safety score: 4 (transitions to 3, then 2)
- Overall Risk score: 4 (transitions to 3, then 2)


- Obstacle ID: 30604
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is very close to the ego vehicle in the front-right. The longitudinal distance initially increases slightly but then decreases.
- Distance safety score: 2
- Time Risk reason: The high lateral relative velocity poses a consistent risk of lateral collision, despite the longitudinal movement.
- Time safety score: 2
- Overall Risk score: 2



### Safety analysis for timestep 5.2s - 5.4s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 30603
- Distance Risk reason: Zero distance indicates a collision.
- Distance safety score: 0
- Time Risk reason:  Collision is imminent.
- Time safety score: 0
- Overall Risk score: 0

- Obstacle ID: 30604
- Distance Risk reason: Zero distance indicates a collision.
- Distance safety score: 0
- Time Risk reason: Collision is imminent.
- Time safety score: 0
- Overall Risk score: 0
