* **Obstacle 30603 Analysis:**

This obstacle is to the left of the ego vehicle, with a longitudinal distance of 0.00m and a lateral distance of 10.79m.  The longitudinal velocity is 0 m/s, indicating perfect longitudinal alignment throughout the provided timestamps. The lateral relative velocity is -0.17 m/s, meaning the obstacle is moving away from the ego vehicle laterally.

Given the significant lateral distance and the fact that the obstacle is moving away laterally, there is no risk of collision with this obstacle.

* **Obstacle 30604 Analysis:**

This obstacle is to the right of the ego vehicle, with a longitudinal distance of 0.00m and a lateral distance of -2.45m. The longitudinal velocity is 6.54 m/s, which likely represents the ego vehicle's velocity since the data states "Exact longitudinal alignment."  The key here is the lateral relative velocity of 4.93 m/s, indicating the obstacle is moving towards the ego vehicle laterally.

The lateral distance is decreasing, and with a substantial lateral closing velocity, a collision is highly possible. To confirm this, we'll calculate the TTC in the lateral direction:

TTC (Lateral) = Distance / Relative Velocity = 2.45m / 4.93 m/s â‰ˆ 0.5 seconds

A TTC of 0.5 seconds or less indicates an *Extreme Risk (1)* of collision.


* **Collision Scenario Determination:**

Since Obstacle 30604 has an *Extreme Risk (1)* rating with a TTC of approximately 0.5 seconds, this is classified as a **collision scenario**.
