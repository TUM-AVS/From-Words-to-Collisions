**Obstacle Analysis:**

### Obstacle 30603:
- **Position Description:** At 5.4 seconds, Obstacle 30603 is primarily to the left of the ego vehicle with a raw longitudinal distance of 0.00 meters (exact longitudinal alignment) and a lateral distance of 10.79 meters.
- **Velocity and Motion:** The relative velocity in the lateral direction is -0.17 m/s, indicating a slight approach from the left.
- **Trajectory Analysis:**
  - Over previous time steps, lateral distance decreased slightly from 10.83m to 10.79m, implying a slow approach.
  - Longitudinal alignment remains constant indicating no forward/backward motion relative to the ego vehicle.
- **Risk Calculation:**
  - **MDC calculation:** Since the obstacle is side-aligned, focus on lateral distance: 10.79m (MDC > 5.0m, No Risk)
  - **TTC calculation:** Lateral distances change very slightly; TTC is therefore not critical as relative speed is minimal and positive indicating steady paths.
- **Risk Assessment:** With the trajectory and distance, Obstacle 30603 presents **No Risk (5)** due to the significant lateral distance and minimal relative velocity.

### Obstacle 30604:
- **Position Description:** At 5.4 seconds, Obstacle 30604 is on the right of the ego vehicle with a raw longitudinal distance of 0.00 meters (exact longitudinal alignment) and a decreasing lateral distance of -2.45 meters.
- **Velocity and Motion:** The relative lateral velocity is 4.93 m/s, showing the obstacle is rapidly approaching laterally from the right.
- **Trajectory Analysis:**
  - Over previous time steps, longitudinal alignment is constant, but the lateral distance substantially decreased from -4.43m to -2.45m, signaling convergence.
  - This trend, combined with rapid lateral velocity, suggests an imminent path crossing.
- **Risk Calculation:**
  - **MDC calculation:** Focus on lateral proximity due to side positioning: 2.45m (indicates Medium Risk if distance keeps decreasing).
  - **TTC calculation:** TTC based on lateral velocity and distance is critical; significant velocity suggests a possible interaction time of around 0.496 seconds (considered High Risk due to quick approaching trajectory).
- **Risk Assessment:** Given the fast decreasing lateral distance and high relative closing velocity, Obstacle 30604 presents a **High Risk (2)**.

**Collision Scenario Determination:**
- **Overall Assessment:** Obstacle 30604 displays a potentially high risk due to its lateral trajectory and relative speed, which could demand swift intervention to prevent a near-miss situation. However, neither obstacle directly results in a collision under current parameters.
- **Conclusion:** The highest risk score is 2 for Obstacle 30604, indicating approaching danger but not an immediate collision. Therefore, this scenario does not immediately classify as a collision scenario.
