### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
    - Obstacle ID: 30603
    - Relative Direction: Left
    - Distance Risk Reason:  DTClat is > 5, indicating negligible lateral risk. DTClong is 0.0 as per the last timestep meaning very high longitudinal risk. Due to Left direction wdominant = 0, lateral distance is dominant. So overall distance risk is negligible.
    - Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 0
    - Lateral Distance Safety Score: 5
    - Overall Distance Safety Score: 5.0
    - Time Risk Reason: TTClat is >5 indicating negligible lateral risk. TTClong is 0.0, indicating collision risk longitudinally. The obstacle has moved from Rear-left to Left, suggesting a primarily lateral trajectory. 
    - Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 0
    - Lateral Time Safety Score: 5
    - Overall Time Safety Score: 5.0
    - Overall Risk Score: 5

    - Obstacle ID: 30604
    - Relative Direction: Right
    - Distance Risk Reason: DTClat is less than 0.5, indicating extreme lateral risk. DTClong is 0.0, indicating high longitudinal risk. Due to Right direction, lateral distance is dominant (wdominant=0)
    - Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 0
    - Lateral Distance Safety Score: 1
    - Overall Distance Safety Score: 1.0
    - Time Risk Reason: TTClat is less than 0.5, indicating extreme lateral risk. TTClong is 0, indicating collision risk longitudinally.  Lateral TTC has consistently decreased over previous timesteps, indicating increasing risk.
    - Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 0
    - Lateral Time Safety Score: 1
    - Overall Time Safety Score: 1.0
    - Overall Risk Score: 1
