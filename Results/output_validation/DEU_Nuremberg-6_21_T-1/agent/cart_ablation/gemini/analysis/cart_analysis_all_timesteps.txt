Analysis:

Obstacle 30802: This obstacle remains at a safe distance from the ego vehicle throughout the provided timeframe. The distance between the two vehicles does not decrease significantly, and both vehicles are decelerating. Therefore, the risk associated with this obstacle is negligible.

Obstacle 30803: This obstacle is much closer to the ego vehicle than obstacle 30802.  While the data shows no immediate collision, the distance between the ego vehicle and obstacle 30803 is decreasing over time.  Both are decelerating, but the rate of deceleration for the ego vehicle increases significantly between timesteps 6.3 and 6.5. The proximity and closing distance combined with deceleration suggest that this obstacle is closing faster than obstacle 30802 and presents a possible risk, which must be watched and potentially addressed in the near future to avoid potential risk. Hence, it represents a High Risk.
