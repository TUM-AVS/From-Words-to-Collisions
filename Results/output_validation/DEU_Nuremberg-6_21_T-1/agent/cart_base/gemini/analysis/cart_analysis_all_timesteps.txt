Obstacle 30802: This obstacle is consistently ahead of the ego vehicle and moving slower.  The longitudinal distance between the ego and obstacle 30802 remains large and is increasing over time.  The lateral distance also appears safe. This obstacle poses a negligible risk.

Obstacle 30803: This obstacle is initially near the ego vehicle. Both vehicles are in the same lane and traveling in roughly the same direction.  Although the obstacle's velocity is lower than the ego's, the ego is decelerating faster than the obstacle, narrowing the distance between them. Examining the provided positions, the y-coordinates (lateral position) remain relatively close. The x-coordinates (longitudinal position) are converging, especially between t=5.6s and t=6.5s. The shrinking distance and converging velocities indicate a potential collision if these trends continue. This obstacle represents a high risk.
