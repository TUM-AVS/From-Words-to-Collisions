To evaluate the given scenario, let's first analyze the motion and positions from timestep 5.6 seconds to 6.5 seconds for the ego vehicle and the obstacles.

### Analysis of Obstacle Trends

1. **Ego Vehicle (30805.0)**
   - The velocity decreases from 13.5846 to 8.373 over the time period, indicating a clear reduction in speed.
   - Continuous negative acceleration implies it is decelerating rapidly.

2. **Obstacle 30802.0**
   - This obstacle has a low starting velocity (5.8652) which decreases further to 3.6179.
   - It remains at some distance from the ego vehicle, decreasing its speed steadily.

3. **Obstacle 30803.0**
   - The initial velocity is higher compared to obstacle 30802.0 at 9.3779, coming down to 7.3187.
   - This obstacle is the closest to the ego vehicle, moving in parallel trajectories.

### Key Risk Insights

- **Obstacle 30802.0** was initially further from the ego vehicle both in terms of position and velocity differences.
- **Obstacle 30803.0** presents significant concern due to its close proximity to the ego vehicle and similar lane trajectory. Despite deceleration, the slow decay of its velocity suggests that any miscalculation in TTC or changes in ego behavior could lead to a collision.

### Conclusion
Based on the TTC and MDC evaluations combined with the strict parallel positioning in lanelet 485, obstacle 30803.0 could be deemed as presenting a higher risk, although no immediate collision threat is detected.

### JSON Output 

```json
{
    "CollisionObstacles": [],
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "",
        "OverallRiskScore": 1
    },
    "HighRiskObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "30803.0",
        "OverallRiskScore": 2
    }
}
```

In this scenario, none of the obstacles are in immediate collision with the ego vehicle; hence, there are no scores of 0 or 1. However, based on proximity and relative speed, Obstacle 30803.0 is assessed as a high-risk obstacle with a score of 2.
