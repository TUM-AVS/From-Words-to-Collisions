### Analysis:

1. **Obstacle 30803.0**:
   - **Position**: At 6.5s, the obstacle is at (478.3359, 142.7982), while the ego is at (473.3998, 141.8878). The lateral distance is minimal (~0.91m), and the longitudinal distance is ~4.94m.
   - **Velocity**: Ego is decelerating (8.373 m/s), while the obstacle is also decelerating (7.3187 m/s). The relative velocity is ~1.0543 m/s (ego is faster).
   - **TTC**: ~4.94 / 1.0543 ≈ 4.69s. The TTC is moderate, but the lateral distance is very small, indicating a potential collision risk if trajectories converge further.
   - **Risk**: **Medium Risk (3)** due to manageable TTC but close proximity.

2. **Obstacle 30802.0**:
   - **Position**: At 6.5s, the obstacle is at (496.4353, 146.4569), while the ego is at (473.3998, 141.8878). The longitudinal distance is ~23.04m, and the lateral distance is ~4.57m.
   - **Velocity**: Ego is decelerating (8.373 m/s), while the obstacle is decelerating (3.6179 m/s). The relative velocity is ~4.7551 m/s (ego is faster).
   - **TTC**: ~23.04 / 4.7551 ≈ 4.85s. The TTC is moderate, and the lateral distance is significant.
   - **Risk**: **Low Risk (4)** due to sufficient distance and time to react.

### Highest Risks:
- **Obstacle 30803.0** poses the highest risk due to close proximity and minimal lateral distance. However, the TTC is still manageable, so it is not yet extreme or collision risk.
