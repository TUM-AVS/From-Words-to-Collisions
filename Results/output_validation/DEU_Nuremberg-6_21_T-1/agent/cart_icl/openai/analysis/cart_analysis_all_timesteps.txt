### Analysis:

Let's evaluate the scenario at the most recent timestep, 6.5 seconds:

- **Ego Vehicle:**  
  - Position: (473.3998, 141.8878)
  - Velocity: 8.373 m/s
  - Acceleration: -4.737 m/s²
  - Lanelet: 485

- **Obstacle 30802:**
  - Position: (496.4353, 146.4569)
  - Velocity: 3.6179 m/s
  - Acceleration: -2.5492 m/s²
  - Lanelet: 485
  - Relative to Ego:
    - Longitudinal Position: Approximately 23.0355 meters ahead of the Ego.
    - Same Lanelet.
    - Relative Velocity: 8.373 - 3.6179 = 4.7551 m/s (approaching).

  **TTC Calculation for Obstacle 30802:**  
  Since obstacle 30802 is ahead and slowing down, the TTC is substantial, indicating that the Ego is approaching but has time to act before a collision can occur. Since the distance is significant and the Ego is decelerating, the risk is not immediate.

- **Obstacle 30803:**
  - Position: (478.3359, 142.7982)
  - Velocity: 7.3187 m/s
  - Acceleration: -2.2441 m/s²
  - Lanelet: 485
  - Relative to Ego:
    - Longitudinal Position: Approximately 4.9361 meters ahead of the Ego.
    - Same Lanelet.
    - Relative Velocity: 8.373 - 7.3187 = 1.0543 m/s (approaching).

  **TTC Calculation for Obstacle 30803:**  
  This obstacle is very close and slowing down, with a relative velocity indicating that the Ego is closing in, but not as quickly as with obstacle 30802. The situation requires attention but is still manageable; hence higher than Low Risk, but not Extreme or Collision.

### Risk Assessment:

- **Obstacle 30802:**
  - **Risk Level:** Low Risk (4)  
  Due to its position far ahead and stable deceleration, this obstacle does not imminently threaten the Ego.

- **Obstacle 30803:**
  - **Risk Level:** Medium Risk (3)  
  Close proximity and slowing down could lead to a potential collision scenario if not monitored closely, suggesting actions might be necessary to avoid risk escalation.

The computed relative positions and velocities, combined with the deceleration rates, suggest that immediate collision is not likely within the given timeline.
