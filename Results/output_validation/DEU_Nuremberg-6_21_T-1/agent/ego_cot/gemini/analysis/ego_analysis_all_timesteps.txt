### Safety analysis for timestep 6.5 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

Obstacle 30802 appears to maintain a safe distance and velocity relative to the ego vehicle.  Obstacle 30803, however, poses an extreme risk. It is very close, less than 1 meter, and the relative velocity suggests a likely collision if the trajectories remain unchanged. The substantial positive relative acceleration for Obstacle 30803 also suggests the ego vehicle might be braking hard, further pointing towards a high-risk scenario.


### Obstacle Analysis:
**- Obstacle ID: 30802**
- Distance Risk reason:  At 18.97m longitudinally and laterally, this obstacle is far from the ego vehicle.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Assuming constant velocity, TTC is greater than 5 seconds.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

**- Obstacle ID: 30803**
- Distance Risk reason: At 0.51m longitudinally and laterally, this obstacle is extremely close to the ego vehicle.
- Distance safety score: 1
- Time Risk reason: The closing velocity is still negative and the distance is minimal, suggesting imminent collision.
- Time safety score: 1
- Overall Risk score: 1
