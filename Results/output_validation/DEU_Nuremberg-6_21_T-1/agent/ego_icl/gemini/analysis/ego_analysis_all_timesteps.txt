Obstacle 30802:
- Trajectory: Consistently in front of the ego vehicle, maintaining lateral alignment (0.00 m lateral distance) while the longitudinal distance decreases across timesteps.
- At 6.5 seconds:
    - Longitudinal distance: 18.97 m
    - Longitudinal relative velocity: -4.76 m/s (approaching)
    - TTC (longitudinal): 18.97 / 4.76 ≈ 3.99 s 
    - MDC: ≈ 18.97 m (since lateral distance is 0, MDC is simply the longitudinal distance)
    - Risk (based on TTC): Low (4)
    - Risk (based on MDC): Low (4)
- Overall Risk: Low (4)

Obstacle 30803:
- Trajectory: Consistently in front of the ego vehicle, maintaining lateral alignment (0.00 m lateral distance) while the longitudinal distance rapidly decreases across timesteps.
- At 6.5 seconds:
    - Longitudinal distance: 0.51 m
    - Longitudinal relative velocity: -1.05 m/s (approaching)
    - TTC (longitudinal): 0.51 / 1.05 ≈ 0.49 s
    - MDC: ≈ 0.51 m (since lateral distance is 0, MDC is simply the longitudinal distance)
    - Risk (based on TTC): Extreme (1)
    - Risk (based on MDC): Extreme (1)
- Overall Risk: Extreme (1)
