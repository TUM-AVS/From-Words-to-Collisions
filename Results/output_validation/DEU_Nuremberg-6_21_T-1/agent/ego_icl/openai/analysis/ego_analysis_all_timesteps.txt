To properly assess the risk of collision with the ego vehicle, we'll examine the available data on obstacles at the most recent timestep and apply our safety analysis framework.

### Obstacle 30802 Analysis:

#### At 6.5 seconds:
- **Relative Position and Motion**: Obstacle 30802 is directly in the front of the ego vehicle with a longitudinal alignment of 18.97 meters. It maintains lateral alignment, lateral relative distance at 0.00 meters, and is approaching (as longitudinal distance decreasing and velocity is negative).
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal relative velocity is -4.76 m/s, indicating the obstacle is moving towards the ego vehicle.
- **Acceleration**: The obstacle shows a decrease in longitudinal deceleration with recent increasing acceleration trends, suggesting it may be starting to slow its approach.
- **MDC Calculation**: The MDC is 18.97 meters, which is significant and indicates a low risk of imminent collision.
- **TTC Calculation**: With a distance of 18.97m and closing speed of 4.76m/s, the TTC is approximately 3.98 seconds.

#### Risk Assessment:
- **TTC < 5 seconds** qualifies for "Low Risk" since the obstacle is closing but with a considerable time before collision would occur. 
- **MDC > 5 meters** similarly indicates a low risk of collision.

Overall Risk for Obstacle 30802: **4 (Low Risk)**

### Obstacle 30803 Analysis:

#### At 6.5 seconds:
- **Relative Position and Motion**: Obstacle 30803 is directly in the front of the ego car with a longitudinal distance of 0.51 meters, which indicates significant proximity. Lateral distance remains 0.00 meters, indicating complete alignment in the same lane.
- **Relative Velocity**: -1.05 m/s; the obstacle is moving toward the ego vehicle, but the speed has been decreasing.
- **Acceleration**: Positive longitudinal acceleration suggests the vehicle is decelerating less, potentially planning to match speed.
- **MDC Calculation**: The MDC is now 0.51 m, which is close and indicates immediate action may be required to prevent collision.
- **TTC Calculation**: With a distance of 0.51 meters and a relative velocity of 1.05 m/s (toward ego), TTC is approximately 0.49 seconds.

#### Risk Assessment:
- **TTC = 0.49 seconds** falls under "Extreme Risk," indicating immediate potential for collision without evasive action.
- **MDC â‰¤ 0.5 meters** suggests an imminent risk as per criteria for immediate action.

Overall Risk for Obstacle 30803: **1 (Extreme Risk)**
