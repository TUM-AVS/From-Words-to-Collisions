At t=6.7s, Ego (30805.0) is at (475.0638, 142.1954) with a velocity of 7.0092 m/s.

Obstacle 30802.0 is at (497.0907, 146.606) with velocity 3.2214 m/s.  The distance is substantial and the trajectories don't appear to intersect soon, so this obstacle poses no immediate threat.

Obstacle 30803.0 is at (479.7218, 143.0507) with velocity 6.8923 m/s.  This obstacle is much closer to the ego vehicle.  Analyzing the trajectories from previous timesteps, both vehicles are moving in roughly the same direction and decelerating.  However, the lateral distance is relatively small and needs careful monitoring in the next timestep, although not an immediate collision risk.

Since there are no obstacles with a risk score of 0 or 1, we set CollisionObstacles and ExtremeRiskObstacle accordingly in the JSON.


```json
{
    "CollisionObstacles": [],
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null,
    "ScenarioAnalysis": {
        "IsCollisionScenario": false,
        "Reasoning": "No imminent collisions detected at t=6.7s. Obstacle 30803.0 requires monitoring due to proximity, but currently poses no extreme risk."
    }
}
