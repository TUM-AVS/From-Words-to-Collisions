At t=6.7s, Ego (30805.0) is at (475.0638, 142.1954) with a velocity of 7.0092 m/s.

Obstacle 30802.0 is at (497.0907, 146.606) with a velocity of 3.2214 m/s.  The distance is substantial and both Ego and this obstacle are decelerating.  This obstacle poses no immediate threat.

Obstacle 30803.0 is at (479.7218, 143.0507) with velocity 6.8923 m/s.  This is the closest obstacle. While the absolute distance isn't extremely small, the lateral distance is minimal and the vehicles are traveling at similar speeds in the same lane. The trajectory history suggests a possible lane change by the Ego, but the current information doesn't definitively indicate this.  Given the proximity and velocity differences, I rate this as a high risk (2), warranting close monitoring, but not an extreme risk.
