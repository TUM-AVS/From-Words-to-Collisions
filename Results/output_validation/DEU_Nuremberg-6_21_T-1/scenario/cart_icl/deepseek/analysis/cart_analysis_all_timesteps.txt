### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep (6.7 seconds):

### Obstacle Analysis:
- **Obstacle ID: 30803**  
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Very close to ego (479.7218, 143.0507 vs ego 475.0638, 142.1954), moving towards ego with decreasing velocity (7.0958 m/s).  
  - **Distance safety score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)  
  - **Time Risk reason**: High relative velocity (ego decelerating to 7.0092 m/s), TTC < 2s.  
  - **Time safety score**: 1  
  - **Overall Risk score**: 1  

- **Obstacle ID: 30802**  
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Close (497.0907, 146.606), but lateral distance increasing.  
  - **Distance safety score**: 3  
  - **Time Risk reason**: Decelerating (3.2214 m/s), not directly intersecting.  
  - **Time safety score**: 3  
  - **Overall Risk score**: 3  

- **Obstacle ID: 30799**  
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Moderate distance (535.9992, 157.198), moving away.  
  - **Distance safety score**: 4  
  - **Time Risk reason**: Decelerating (5.2199 m/s), no immediate threat.  
  - **Time safety score**: 4  
  - **Overall Risk score**: 4  

- **Other Obstacles (30784-30808, excluding above)**:  
  - All have **Overall Risk score**: 4-5 (Negligible/Low Risk) due to sufficient distance (>50m) or divergent trajectories.  

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. **Ego Vehicle**: Decelerating (7.0092 m/s, -4.2775 m/sÂ²) in lanelet 485.  
2. **Critical Obstacle**: 30803 is closing in (7.0958 m/s) with <5m longitudinal distance.  
3. **Collision Risk**: No direct collision at 6.7s, but extreme risk due to proximity and converging paths.  
4. **Historical Trend**: 30803 has maintained a closing trajectory over 10 timesteps.
