### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 30802.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is far from the ego vehicle and moving further away.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Relative velocity and acceleration suggest no risk of collision.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 30803.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is moderately close, but separating from ego vehicle.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason:  Relative velocity and acceleration indicate decreasing risk.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4


### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. At the most recent timestep (6.7s), both obstacles are in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle.
2. Obstacle 30802.0 is significantly further away than 30803.0 and poses no immediate threat.
3. Obstacle 30803.0 is closer but the distance between it and the ego vehicle is increasing over the observed timesteps.  
4. Both obstacles are decelerating, which further mitigates the risk.
5. This is not a collision scenario.
