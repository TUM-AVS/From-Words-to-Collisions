### Obstacle Analysis:

#### Obstacle ID: 30802.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle (30802.0) is located at (497.0907, 146.606), with respect to the ego vehicle at (475.0638, 142.1954). The relative trajectory shows that the obstacle has been moving away slightly in the lateral direction over time, both are in the same lanelet. However, the closest approach over the last few timesteps was not within immediate proximity.
- **Distance safety score**: 4
- **Time Risk reason**: The velocity of the obstacle has decreased over time and showed a pattern of constant deceleration, leading to a lower risk of a collision given the decreased relative speed.
- **Time safety score**: 4
- **Overall Risk score**: 4

#### Obstacle ID: 30803.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle (30803.0) is at (479.7218, 143.0507), showing a trajectory parallel to the ego vehicle, both in the same lanelet , but at a moderately safe distance. The relative positions are not indicative of a collision course.
- **Distance safety score**: 4
- **Time Risk reason**: The obstacle's speed has been consistently decreasing, following a trajectory not converging with the ego vehicle and maintaining an adequate safety buffer. The velocity differential is not indicative of a collision.
- **Time safety score**: 4
- **Overall Risk score**: 4

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. Both obstacles have been consistently decelerating and the relative positions do not indicate a converging trajectory towards the ego vehicle.
2. The distances and velocities, along with the same deceleration trend, suggest no immediate threat or collision course.
3. Analysis of the most recent timestep confirms there is no indication of imminent collision risk.
