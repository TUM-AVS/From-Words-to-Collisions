Obstacle 30802 is relatively far from the ego vehicle (17.95m) and has a low relative longitudinal velocity (-3.79 m/s). It does not pose an immediate collision risk.

Obstacle 30803 is extremely close to the ego vehicle (0.23m) with a small negative relative longitudinal velocity (-0.12 m/s). This indicates an extremely high risk of collision. The MDC is less than 0.5m and TTC is likely to be less than 0.5s if the relative velocity remains negative.

    "IsCollisionScenario": false,
    "Reasoning": "Obstacle 30803 poses an extreme risk of collision due to its very close proximity (0.23m) and negative relative longitudinal velocity. While not a collision yet, it is highly likely to collide in the next timestep if no evasive action is taken. Obstacle 30802 is not a collision risk currently."
