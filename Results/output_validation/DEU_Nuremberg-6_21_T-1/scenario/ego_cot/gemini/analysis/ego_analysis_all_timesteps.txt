### Safety analysis for timestep 5.8s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- **Obstacle ID:** 30802
- **Distance Risk reason:** Obstacle is relatively far from the ego vehicle (23.77m longitudinally).
- **Distance safety score:** 5
- **Time Risk reason:**  While the obstacle is approaching the ego vehicle longitudinally (-7.33 m/s), the distance is substantial, suggesting ample time to react.
- **Time safety score:** 4
- **Overall Risk score:** 4

- **Obstacle ID:** 30803
- **Distance Risk reason:** Obstacle is very close to the ego vehicle (2.76m longitudinally).
- **Distance safety score:** 1
- **Time Risk reason:** Obstacle is approaching the ego vehicle longitudinally at a significant speed (-3.75 m/s), indicating a very short time to collision.
- **Time safety score:** 1
- **Overall Risk score:** 1

### Safety analysis for timestep 5.9s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- **Obstacle ID:** 30802
- **Distance Risk reason:**  Obstacle is relatively far from the ego vehicle (22.99m longitudinally).
- **Distance safety score:** 5
- **Time Risk reason:** While the obstacle is approaching, the distance provides a safe buffer.
- **Time safety score:** 4
- **Overall Risk score:** 4

- **Obstacle ID:** 30803
- **Distance Risk reason:** Obstacle is extremely close to the ego vehicle (2.34m longitudinally).
- **Distance safety score:** 1
- **Time Risk reason:**  Obstacle is approaching at a concerning speed, suggesting imminent collision.
- **Time safety score:** 1
- **Overall Risk score:** 1


### Safety analysis for timestep 6.0s through 6.7s:
(Detailed analysis for each timestep from 6.0 to 6.7 would be similar to the above examples. Key observations are that Obstacle 30802 remains at low risk (score 4) throughout this period, while Obstacle 30803's risk continues to be extreme (score 1) and progresses towards a collision.  The longitudinal distance for Obstacle 30803 decreases steadily, indicating a high probability of collision if no evasive action is taken).

For brevity, the full breakdown of 6.0 through 6.7 is omitted, but the trend clearly shows 30803 is on a collision course.  Let's focus on the final provided timestep.


### Safety analysis for timestep 6.7s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- **Obstacle ID:** 30802
- **Distance Risk reason:** Obstacle is far from the ego vehicle (17.95m longitudinally).
- **Distance safety score:** 5
- **Time Risk reason:** While approaching, there's sufficient time and distance for the ego vehicle to react.
- **Time safety score:** 4
- **Overall Risk score:** 4


- **Obstacle ID:** 30803
- **Distance Risk reason:** Extremely close proximity (0.23m).  Collision is almost certain.
- **Distance safety score:** 0
- **Time Risk reason:** The small relative longitudinal velocity (-0.12 m/s) at this close distance indicates a likely collision has already occurred or is imminent.
- **Time safety score:** 0
- **Overall Risk score:** 0



### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
  "CollisionObstacle": {
    "ObstacleID": "30803",
    "OverallRiskScore": "0"
  },
  "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null, 
  "IsCollisionScenario": true,
  "Justification": "Obstacle 30803 shows a consistent trend of decreasing longitudinal distance to the ego vehicle, reaching a critically close proximity of 0.23m at 6.7 seconds. The relative velocity and the continuous approach pattern indicate a collision has likely occurred at or around this time."
