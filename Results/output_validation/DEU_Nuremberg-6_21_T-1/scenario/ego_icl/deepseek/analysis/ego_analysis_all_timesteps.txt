### Obstacle-by-Obstacle Analysis (Most Recent Timestep: 6.7s)

#### **Obstacle 30802 (Front)**
- **Adjusted Distance**: Longitudinal 17.95m, Lateral 0.00m  
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal -3.79 m/s (approaching), Lateral 0.13 m/s (minor drift)  
- **Motion**: Driving toward ego longitudinally with exact lateral alignment.  

**Risk Assessment**:
1. **Proximity**: Longitudinal distance is large (17.95m), lateral alignment is exact but stable (lateral velocity negligible).  
2. **MDC**: Lateral distance = 0.00m, but longitudinal distance is significant. MDC is effectively the longitudinal distance (17.95m) → **No Risk (5)**.  
3. **TTC**: Longitudinal TTC = 17.95 / 3.79 ≈ 4.74s → **Low Risk (4)**.  
   - Lateral TTC is irrelevant (no closing velocity).  
4. **Overall Risk**: **Low Risk (4)** (no imminent collision).  

**Trajectory Analysis**:  
- Longitudinal distance decreasing steadily but at a reducing rate (relative velocity decreasing due to positive acceleration).  
- Lateral drift is minimal and not closing.

#### **Obstacle 30803 (Front)**
- **Adjusted Distance**: Longitudinal 0.23m, Lateral 0.00m  
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal -0.12 m/s (very slow approach), Lateral -0.02 m/s (negligible).  
- **Motion**: Driving toward ego longitudinally with exact lateral alignment.  

**Risk Assessment**:
1. **Proximity**: Extremely close longitudinally (0.23m), exact lateral alignment.  
2. **MDC**: 0.23m → **Extreme Risk (1)** (MDC < 0.5m).  
3. **TTC**: Longitudinal TTC = 0.23 / 0.12 ≈ 1.92s → **Medium Risk (3)**.  
   - However, at this proximity, TTC is less critical than MDC.  
4. **Overall Risk**: **Extreme Risk (1)** (MDC dominates).  

**Trajectory Analysis**:  
- Longitudinal distance has decreased rapidly from 2.76m to 0.23m in 0.9s.  
- Relative velocity is now very low (-0.12 m/s), but the obstacle is already within 0.23m.  
- Likely a near-collision or very recent collision (e.g., bumper-to-bumper contact).

### **Collision Scenario Determination**
- **Obstacle 30803** is at **Extreme Risk (1)** with MDC = 0.23m (less than 0.5m) and exact lateral alignment.  
- While TTC suggests Medium Risk, the actual distance is critically small, indicating an imminent or recent collision.  
- **Obstacle 30802** poses no immediate threat.
