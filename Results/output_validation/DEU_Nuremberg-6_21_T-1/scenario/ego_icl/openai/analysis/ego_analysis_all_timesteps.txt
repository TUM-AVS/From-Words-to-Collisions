### Obstacle-by-Obstacle Analysis

#### Obstacle 30802
- **Most Recent Timestamp (6.7 seconds):**
  - Adjusted Longitudinal Distance: 17.95 m
  - Adjusted Lateral Distance: 0.00 m
  - Relative Velocity (Longitudinal): -3.79 m/s
  - Relative Velocity (Lateral): 0.13 m/s
  - Motion: Moving toward the ego car longitudinally
  
- **Trajectory Analysis:**
  - The obstacle has consistently moved closer to the ego vehicle over recent timesteps, but the longitudinal distance remains above collision thresholds.
  
- **Calculations:**
  - **Time-to-Collision (TTC)** (Longitudinal only, as lateral is zero): 
    - TTC = 17.95 m / 3.79 m/s ≈ 4.74 seconds
  - **Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC):**
    - MDC = 17.95 m (longitudinal), 0.00 m (lateral integration not necessary as the primary collision risk is longitudinal)
  
- **Risk Evaluation:**
  - MDC > 5.0 meters: No Risk (5)
  - The obstacle is decelerating less significantly and maintaining a critical distance well above direct collision risk.

#### Obstacle 30803
- **Most Recent Timestamp (6.7 seconds):**
  - Adjusted Longitudinal Distance: 0.23 m
  - Adjusted Lateral Distance: 0.00 m
  - Relative Velocity (Longitudinal): -0.12 m/s
  - Relative Velocity (Lateral): -0.02 m/s
  - Motion: Driving toward the ego car longitudinally with exact alignment
  
- **Trajectory Analysis:**
  - The obstacle has been approaching extremely closely over recent seconds, consistently reducing its distance with the ego vehicle.
  
- **Calculations:**
  - **Time-to-Collision (TTC):**
    - Longitudinal velocity is almost zero (-0.12 m/s), indicating nearly no further closing speed, although already within extremely close proximity.
  - **Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC):**
    - MDC = 0.23 m (current adjusted longitudinal distance, negligible lateral impact)

- **Risk Evaluation:**
  - MDC ≤ 0.5 meters: Extreme Risk (1)
  - TTC doesn't progress due to minimal velocity, but the critical proximity (0.23 m) and almost zero velocity indicate maintaining extreme risk.

### Collision Scenario Determination

The trajectory and proximity of **Obstacle 30803** indicate an immediate collision risk. The previous and current closeness, declining velocity, and alignment focus suggest the potential of a very near impact. Thus, this situation constitutes an extreme risk condition.

### Conclusion
- **Obstacle 30802:** No Risk (5) due to safe distance.
- **Obstacle 30803:** Extreme Risk (1) due to extreme proximity and nearly zero relative speed.

Given the extreme risk score of Obstacle 30803, this constitutes a collision scenario by proximity and alignment criteria.
