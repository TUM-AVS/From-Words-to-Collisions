### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
    - Obstacle ID: 30802
    - Relative Direction: Front
    - Distance Risk Reason: DTClong is > 5 indicating negligible longitudinal risk. DTClat is 0, but since the obstacle is directly in front, lateral risk is less important. The obstacle has been consistently in front and moving closer over the past timesteps.
    - Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 5
    - Lateral Distance Safety Score: 5
    - Overall Distance Safety Score: 5.0
    - Time Risk Reason: TTClong is > 5, indicating negligible longitudinal risk. TTClat is 0, but since the obstacle is directly in front, the longitudinal TTC is dominant. TTClong has increased slightly in the most recent timestep, suggesting the ego vehicle might be slowing down or the obstacle is accelerating away.
    - Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 5
    - Lateral Time Safety Score: 0
    - Overall Time Safety Score: 5.0
    - Overall Risk Score: 5

    - Obstacle ID: 30803
    - Relative Direction: Front
    - Distance Risk Reason: DTClong is 0.23m, indicating extreme risk. DTClat is 0, meaning no lateral offset. The obstacle has been consistently approaching over the last several timesteps and is now very close.
    - Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 1
    - Lateral Distance Safety Score: 5
    - Overall Distance Safety Score: 1.0
    - Time Risk Reason: TTClong is 1.95s, placing it in the Medium risk category. TTClat is 0. Previous timesteps showed very low TTClong values, but it's increased slightly in the most recent timestep. This suggests some last-minute maneuver by either the ego vehicle or the obstacle, but the situation is still risky.
    - Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 3
    - Lateral Time Safety Score: 0
    - Overall Time Safety Score: 3.0
    - Overall Risk Score: 2
