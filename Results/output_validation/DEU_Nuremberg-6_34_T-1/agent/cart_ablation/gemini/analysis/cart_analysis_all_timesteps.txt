Here's the collision risk analysis:

**Obstacle 30784:** This obstacle is located in a different lanelet (765) than the ego vehicle (2056), and the y-coordinate separation is significant and increasing.  While the obstacle is decelerating, it does not pose an immediate threat. Risk score: 4 (Low Risk).

**Obstacle 30787:**  Static obstacle in a different lanelet (769).  Poses no immediate risk. Risk score: 5 (Negligible Risk).

**Obstacle 30793:** Static obstacle in a different lanelet (765). Poses no immediate risk. Risk score: 5 (Negligible Risk).

**Obstacle 30796:** This obstacle starts in lanelet 2057 and moves into lanelet 2056, the same lanelet as the ego vehicle, and its y-coordinate is converging with the ego vehicle's. Additionally, it has a much higher velocity than the ego vehicle, rapidly decreasing the x-coordinate separation. This presents a high risk of collision in the near future if the ego vehicle does not react.  Risk score: 1 (Extreme Risk - predicted).

**Obstacle 30819:** This obstacle is in a different lanelet (915) and moving away from the ego vehicle. Risk score: 5 (Negligible Risk).

**Obstacle 30841:** Static obstacle in a different lanelet (769). Poses no immediate risk. Risk score: 5 (Negligible Risk).
