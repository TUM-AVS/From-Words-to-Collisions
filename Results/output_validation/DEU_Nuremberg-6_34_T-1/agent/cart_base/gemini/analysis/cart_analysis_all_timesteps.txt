Obstacle 30784: This obstacle is located in a different lanelet (765) than the ego vehicle (2056), and their y-coordinates differ significantly throughout the provided timesteps. The obstacle's velocity is also decreasing.  This suggests a low risk of collision. Risk score: 4

Obstacle 30787: This obstacle is stationary and located in a different lanelet (769).  While the y-coordinates are relatively close to the ego vehicle, the x-coordinate difference suggests a low risk. Risk score: 4

Obstacle 30793:  Similar to 30787, this obstacle is stationary and in a different lanelet (765) with a significant difference in the y-coordinate compared to the ego vehicle. This indicates a low risk. Risk score: 4

Obstacle 30796: This obstacle starts in lanelet 2057 and transitions to 2056, the same lanelet as the ego vehicle.  Furthermore, its x-coordinate is approaching the ego vehicle's x-coordinate while exhibiting high velocity and positive acceleration.  This obstacle poses a high risk of collision. Risk score: 2

Obstacle 30819: This obstacle is in a different lanelet (915) and maintains a safe distance from the ego vehicle throughout the timesteps.  The risk is low. Risk score: 4

Obstacle 30841: Located in lanelet 769, this obstacle maintains a safe x-coordinate distance from the ego vehicle, and its velocity is decreasing. The risk is low. Risk score: 4
