Obstacle 30796 is showing concerning behavior. While not an immediate collision risk in the most recent timestep (3.6 seconds), its high velocity (8.6518) and acceleration (-0.0969, indicating a slight deceleration) while moving closer to the ego vehicle's lane necessitates close monitoring.  It's important to project its trajectory into future timesteps to ensure no collision occurs. If the ego vehicle continues to decelerate at a faster rate and if obstacle 30796 maintains its current trajectory, a risky situation could develop.

Obstacle 30787 is stationary and presents no immediate risk.

Obstacle 30784, although close in Y-coordinate, is not converging on the ego vehicle's X-coordinate and continues to decelerate, further reducing risk.

Obstacle 30793 is stationary far from the ego vehicle and poses no risk.

Obstacle 30819 shows some deceleration but is spatially separated from the ego vehicle.
