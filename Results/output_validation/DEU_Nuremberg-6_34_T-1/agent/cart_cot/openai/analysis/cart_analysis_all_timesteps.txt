### Analysis

At time 3.6 seconds, based on the relative motion and positions of the obstacles compared to the ego vehicle:

1. **Obstacle 30796.0**: This obstacle is sharing the same lanelet as the ego vehicle (2056.0) and is moving towards it at a high speed of 8.6518 m/s with a decreasing distance between them. Given the velocities and positions, a collision is imminent unless urgent action is taken. This results in an extreme risk assessment for this obstacle, as it is highly probable they will collide if no action is taken. The relative positioning and speed suggest this is the most dangerous obstacle.

2. **Obstacle 30787.0** and **30793.0**: Although stationary, these obstacles seem to be relatively distanced from the ego vehicle and do not pose any immediate risk.

3. **Obstacle 30784.0**: Its trajectory doesn't intersect with the ego, and its deceleration and lower velocity indicate it is not in immediate risk areas of the ego vehicle.

4. **Obstacle 30819.0**: This obstacle is in a different lanelet (915.0) and is decelerating significantly. Its trajectory indicates it is not moving into the path of the ego vehicle.

5. **Obstacle 30841.0**: Positioned in a distant lanelet (769.0), moving slowly and away from the ego vehicle's path.
