### Analysis of Risky Obstacles:

1. **Obstacle 30796.0**:
   - **Position**: (569.0602, 112.4262) at 3.6s, moving towards the ego vehicle.
   - **Velocity**: 8.6518 m/s (high speed).
   - **Acceleration**: -0.0969 m/s² (slightly decelerating).
   - **Relative Motion**: The obstacle is in the same lanelet (2056.0) as the ego vehicle and is closing the distance rapidly.
   - **TTC**: The relative distance is decreasing, and the high velocity suggests a short TTC.
   - **Risk**: **Extreme Risk (1)** due to high speed and proximity in the same lane.

2. **Obstacle 30787.0**:
   - **Position**: (578.2151, 108.2154) at all timesteps, stationary.
   - **Velocity**: 0.0 m/s.
   - **Acceleration**: 0.0 m/s².
   - **Relative Motion**: The obstacle is stationary and located in a different lanelet (769.0). The ego vehicle is not on a direct collision path.
   - **Risk**: **Negligible Risk (5)**.

3. **Obstacle 30819.0**:
