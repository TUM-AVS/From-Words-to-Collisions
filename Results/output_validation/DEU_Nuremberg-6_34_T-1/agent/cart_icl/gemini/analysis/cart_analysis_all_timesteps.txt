Obstacle 30796 is approaching ego from behind in the same lane and the distance is decreasing across time steps. At t=3.6s, Obstacle 30796 is approximately 18 meters behind the ego vehicle but traveling significantly faster. This represents a high risk of collision if the ego vehicle were to decelerate suddenly or if Obstacle 30796 does not change lanes or decelerate.

Obstacle 30784 is in a different lane and maintains a safe lateral distance from the ego vehicle. While it is decelerating, its trajectory does not pose an immediate risk to the ego vehicle.

Obstacle 30787, 30793 are stationary and do not pose a risk.

Obstacle 30819 is in a different lane and maintains a safe lateral distance from the ego vehicle. Its large deceleration at t=3.4s is noteworthy, but it does not appear to cause a risk to the ego vehicle at this time. However, further monitoring of its trajectory and dynamic state is recommended.

Obstacle 30841 is in a different lane and far away from the ego. Not risky.
