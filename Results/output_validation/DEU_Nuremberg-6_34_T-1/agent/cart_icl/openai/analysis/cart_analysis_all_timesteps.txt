To evaluate the scenario and assess the risk levels of each obstacle with respect to Ego, I'll analyze their trajectories, velocities, and positions over the provided timesteps, especially focusing on the most recent timestep, which is at 3.6 seconds.

### Risk Evaluation

#### Ego Position and Motion
- **Ego at 3.6s**: Position (573.1552, 107.8264), Velocity 2.079 m/s, Lanelet 2056.0

#### Obstacle 30784.0
- **Position at 3.6s**: (572.5711, 125.5945)
- Moving parallel and slightly behind and above Ego in another lanelet (765.0). It does not present a direct collision risk.
- **Risk Level**: 4 (Low Risk)

#### Obstacle 30787.0
- **Position remains constant**: (578.2151, 108.2154) and stationary.
- Located in a different lanelet (769.0).
- **Risk Level**: 5 (Negligible Risk)

#### Obstacle 30793.0
- **Position remains constant**: (576.7953, 133.1853) and stationary.
- Located in the same lanelet (765.0).
- This is too far north from the Ego, implying no immediate threat.
- **Risk Level**: 5 (Negligible Risk)

#### Obstacle 30796.0
- **Position at 3.6s**: (569.0602, 112.4262)
- Approaching from behind as the Ego slows down, now in the same lanelet as Ego (2056.0).
- Even though it’s approaching, there’s still a safe buffer. However, this does warrant attention.
- **Risk Level**: 3 (Medium Risk)

#### Obstacle 30819.0
- **Position at 3.6s**: (564.0491, 96.5973)
- Moving eastward and diverging laterally downward compared to the Ego’s position at 3.6s.
- Positioned in a different lanelet (915.0).
- **Risk Level**: 5 (Negligible Risk)

#### Obstacle 30841.0
- **Position at 3.6s**: (584.5414, 103.2342)
- Velocity is minimal, and in a different lanelet (769.0).
- **Risk Level**: 5 (Negligible Risk)

### Risk Summary
- **Obstacle 30796.0** is approaching Ego from rear in the same lane, maintaining a higher speed, an early indication of potential risk if conditions persist or change unexpectedly.

### JSON Output

```json
{
    "CollisionObstacles": [],
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {},
    "HighRiskObstacle": {},
    "MediumRiskObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "30796.0",
        "OverallRiskScore": 3
    }
}
```

The obstacles do not immediately threaten a collision or extreme risk. Nevertheless, continuous monitoring of Obstacle 30796.0 is necessary given its higher speed and trajectory that might bring it closer to the ego vehicle.
