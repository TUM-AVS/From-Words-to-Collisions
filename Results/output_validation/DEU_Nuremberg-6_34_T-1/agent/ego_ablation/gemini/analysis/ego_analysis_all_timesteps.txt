At timestamp 3.6 seconds, the following obstacles are present:

* **Obstacle 30784:** Located rear-left with longitudinal distance -6.28 m and lateral distance 12.52 m. Moving away both longitudinally and laterally. This obstacle poses no immediate risk. Proximity (5), MDC (5), TTC (5).

* **Obstacle 30787:** Located left with longitudinal distance 0.00 m and lateral distance 1.64 m.  While longitudinally aligned, the lateral distance is small, making it a potential hazard if the ego vehicle were to move left. The relatively low longitudinal velocity (-2.08 m/s) suggests moderate risk. Proximity (2), MDC (2), TTC (3). This obstacle represents a **high risk**.

* **Obstacle 30793:** Located rear-left with longitudinal distance -7.25 m and lateral distance 21.15 m. Moving away longitudinally.  This obstacle poses no immediate risk. Proximity (5), MDC (5), TTC (5).

* **Obstacle 30796:** Located behind with longitudinal distance -1.50 m and lateral distance 0.00 m. Approaching from behind with a significant longitudinal velocity (5.97 m/s).  While lateral alignment poses no risk, the proximity from behind merits attention as lane changes are dangerous. This needs further monitoring since TTC < 5s. Proximity (2), MDC (3), TTC (3). This represents **medium risk**.

* **Obstacle 30819:** Located right with longitudinal distance 0.00 m and lateral distance -12.82 m. The lateral distance poses minimal risk of immediate collision, although the lateral velocity (5.79 m/s) towards the ego car requires caution. Proximity (4), MDC (5), TTC (5).

* **Obstacle 30841:** Located front-left with longitudinal distance 7.43 m and lateral distance 1.26 m. Although it is approaching longitudinally (-2.62 m/s), both the longitudinal and lateral distances are relatively safe. Proximity (4), MDC (4), TTC (4).
