### Safety analysis for timestep 3.6 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

**Assumptions and Clarifications:**

* **Adjusted Distances:** The prompt emphasizes using *adjusted* distances. However, the provided scenario *only* includes "real distance".  For this analysis, I will assume the "real distance" values provided are already adjusted for vehicle size. If raw distances were provided, a vehicle size estimation would be necessary for proper MDC calculation.
* **TTC Calculation:**  TTC is calculated by dividing the distance to the obstacle by the relative velocity.  A negative relative velocity implies the objects are moving apart. In such cases, TTC is considered infinite (no collision risk), and a safety score of 5 is assigned.
* **Lateral TTC and MDC:** Lateral movement is more complex to assess as slight lateral movements may not indicate a collision risk. Thus, even small lateral distances might be considered safe if the motion description suggests divergence or parallel movement. 

### Obstacle Analysis:

**- Obstacle ID: 30784**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is far behind and to the left of the ego vehicle (DTClong: -6.28m, DTClat: -6.28m).
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Moving away from the ego vehicle longitudinally.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

**- Obstacle ID: 30787**
- Distance Risk reason: Located directly to the left of the ego vehicle (DTClong: 0.00m, DTClat: 0.00m).  This suggests a potential immediate collision risk.
- Distance safety score: 0
- Time Risk reason: Moving away longitudinally, but the zero longitudinal distance is concerning.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 0

**- Obstacle ID: 30793**
- Distance Risk reason: Far behind and to the left of the ego vehicle (DTClong: -7.25m, DTClat: -7.25m).
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Moving away longitudinally.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

**- Obstacle ID: 30796**
- Distance Risk reason: Directly behind the ego vehicle, close proximity (DTClong: -1.50m, DTClat: -1.50m).
- Distance safety score: 2
- Time Risk reason: Approaching the ego vehicle from behind (positive longitudinal relative velocity).
- Time safety score: 2
- Overall Risk score: 2

**- Obstacle ID: 30819**
- Distance Risk reason: Located directly to the right of the ego vehicle (DTClong: 0.00m, DTClat: 0.00m). This suggests a potential immediate collision risk.
- Distance safety score: 0
- Time Risk reason: Although lateral motion suggests movement towards the ego vehicle, longitudinal movement indicates moving away.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 0

**- Obstacle ID: 30841**
- Distance Risk reason:  Reasonably far ahead and to the left (DTClong: 7.43m, DTClat: 7.43m).
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason:  Approaching the ego vehicle longitudinally, but ample time to react.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4
