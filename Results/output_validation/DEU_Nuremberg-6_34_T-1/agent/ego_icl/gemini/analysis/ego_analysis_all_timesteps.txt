* **Obstacle 30784 (Rear-left):** This obstacle is moving away from the ego vehicle both longitudinally (-6.28m) and laterally (12.52m).  There is no risk of collision. Risk Level: 5 (Negligible Risk)

* **Obstacle 30787 (Left):** This obstacle is longitudinally aligned (0.00m) with the ego vehicle at a lateral distance of 1.64m. The lateral velocity suggests it is not moving closer laterally. The longitudinal velocity is negative, indicating it is moving away longitudinally.  There is no immediate collision risk but the proximity warrants monitoring.  Risk Level: 3 (Medium Risk) due to proximity.

* **Obstacle 30793 (Rear-left):** This obstacle is well behind (-7.25m) and to the left (21.15m) of the ego vehicle and moving further away longitudinally. There is no risk of collision. Risk Level: 5 (Negligible Risk)

* **Obstacle 30796 (Behind):** This obstacle is directly behind the ego vehicle (lateral distance 0.00m) at a longitudinal distance of -1.50m. Critically, it has a positive longitudinal velocity (5.97 m/s), indicating it is rapidly approaching the ego vehicle from behind. TTC = 1.5m / 5.97 m/s = 0.25s. This is an extremely high risk situation. Risk Level: 1 (Extreme Risk)

* **Obstacle 30819 (Right):**  This obstacle is longitudinally aligned (0.00m) and to the right (-12.82m) of the ego vehicle.  It is not approaching longitudinally (-5.15 m/s) and is moving away from the ego laterally from the right (5.79 m/s). Though relatively close, the current trajectory does not pose an immediate threat. Risk Level: 4 (Low Risk)

* **Obstacle 30841 (Front-left):** This obstacle is 7.43m ahead longitudinally and 1.26m to the left. It has a negative longitudinal velocity (-2.62m/s), meaning it is moving closer to the ego vehicle longitudinally.  The positive lateral distance and near-zero lateral velocity mean a low lateral risk. TTC = 7.43m/2.62m/s = 2.83s. Risk Level: 3 (Medium Risk)
