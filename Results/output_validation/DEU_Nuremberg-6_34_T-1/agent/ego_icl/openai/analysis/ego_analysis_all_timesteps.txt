### Obstacle Analysis:

1. **Obstacle 30784 (Rear-left)**
   - Adjusted longitudinal distance: -6.28 m (indicating that it is behind)
   - Adjusted lateral distance: 12.52 m
   - Relative velocity: longitudinal -2.23 m/s, lateral 1.12 m/s
   - Motion Description: Moving away both longitudinally and laterally
   - **Trajectory Analysis:**
     - Increasing distance in both dimensions indicates no collision trajectory.
     - Interaction is diverging.
   - **Risk Assessment:**
     - No immediate collision threat; paths are diverging.
     - Negligible Risk: Score 5

2. **Obstacle 30787 (Left)**
   - Adjusted longitudinal distance: 0.00 m
   - Adjusted lateral distance: 1.64 m
   - Relative velocity: longitudinal -2.08 m/s (moving at the same speed or slower), lateral 0.00 m/s
   - Motion Description: Exact longitudinal alignment, no lateral movement
   - **Trajectory Analysis:**
     - Lateral positions are increasing/stable indicating alignment not collision.
   - **Risk Assessment:**
     - Medium Risk (both longitudinal and lateral are stable/increasing): Score 3

3. **Obstacle 30793 (Rear-left)**
   - Adjusted longitudinal distance: -7.25 m (behind the ego)
   - Adjusted lateral distance: 21.15 m
   - Relative velocity: longitudinal -2.08 m/s, lateral 0.00 m/s
   - Motion Description: Moving away longitudinally, no lateral movement
   - **Trajectory Analysis:**
     - Stable increasing distances in both dimensions are diverging.
   - **Risk Assessment:**
     - Negligible Risk: Score 5

4. **Obstacle 30796 (Behind)**
   - Adjusted longitudinal distance: -1.50 m
   - Adjusted lateral distance: 0.00 m
   - Relative velocity: longitudinal 5.97 m/s (closing)
   - Motion Description: Approaching from behind
   - **Trajectory Analysis:**
     - Closing longitudinally with 0.00 m lateral alignment.
     - Could potentially become critical.
   - **Risk Assessment:**
     - High Risk due to near-zero lateral distance and decreasing longitudinal distance over time: Score 2

5. **Obstacle 30819 (Right)**
   - Adjusted longitudinal distance: 0.00 m
   - Adjusted lateral distance: -12.82 m
   - Relative velocity: longitudinal -5.15 m/s, lateral 5.79 m/s
   - Motion Description: Moving towards laterally
   - **Trajectory Analysis:**
     - Side-by-side alignment without closing lateral effectively
   - **Risk Assessment:**
     - Minimal risk given negative lateral position; paths are diverging: Score 5

6. **Obstacle 30841 (Front-left)**
   - Adjusted longitudinal distance: 7.43 m
   - Adjusted lateral distance: 1.26 m
   - Relative velocity: longitudinal -2.62 m/s, lateral 0.01 m/s
   - Motion Description: Approaching in the longitudinal direction
   - **Trajectory Analysis:**
     - No immediate threat given the steady lateral distance and closing longitudinally over a safely manageable distance.
   - **Risk Assessment:**
     - Low Risk: Lateral distance is large enough to provide maneuver room, medium-risk in the future if speed increases further: Score 4

### Summary:

```
{
    "CollisionObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "NULL",
        "OverallRiskScore": "5"
    },
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "NULL",
        "OverallRiskScore": "5"
    },
    "HighRiskObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "30796",
        "OverallRiskScore": "2"
    }
}
```

**Note:** No obstacles entered collision or extreme proximity risks. Obstacle 30796 is identified as requiring heightened attention due to its relative closing velocity and alignment.
