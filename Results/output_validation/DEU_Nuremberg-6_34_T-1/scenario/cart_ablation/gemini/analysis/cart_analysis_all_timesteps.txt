Obstacle 30796 shows the highest risk.  It is in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle (2056) and rapidly approaching from behind at a significantly higher velocity (8.67 m/s vs ego's 1.67 m/s). Although not an immediate collision at the last timestep (3.8 seconds), an immediate collision is highly likely given the velocity difference and closing distance.  The drastic negative acceleration of Obstacle 30819 might warrant future monitoring, but it does not pose an immediate threat at this timestep.  The other obstacles are stationary or moving slowly and are far enough away to not present extreme risk.
