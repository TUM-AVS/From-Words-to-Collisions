Obstacle 30796 is in the same lanelet (2056) as the ego vehicle at the last timestep (3.8 seconds) and is rapidly approaching from behind (velocity 8.67 m/s vs ego's 1.67 m/s).  Given the relatively small longitudinal distance between them (around 27 meters based on the provided coordinates) and the closing speeds, a collision is highly probable within the next few seconds if the ego vehicle does not accelerate or the obstacle decelerates. Therefore, obstacle 30796 poses an extreme risk.

Obstacle 30787 is stationary in lanelet 769 and is laterally close to the ego vehicle in lanelet 2056. While not an immediate threat, this obstacle's static presence requires attention from the ego vehicle for safe lane changes or maneuvers.  The ego's velocity is decreasing, but still warrants consideration, thus being rated as a medium risk (3).  There is no immediate danger of a collision, so the risk score for this is not 1.
