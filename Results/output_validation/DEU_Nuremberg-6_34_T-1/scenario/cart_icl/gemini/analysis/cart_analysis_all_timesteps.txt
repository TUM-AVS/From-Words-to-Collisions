### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 30784.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is in a different lanelet and poses no immediate threat.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason:  Consistent lateral separation; no risk from relative velocity/acceleration.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 30787.0
- Distance Risk reason: Laterally separated and stationary; no immediate risk.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Stationary; no risk from relative motion.
- Time safety score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 30793.0
- Distance Risk reason: Located in a different lanelet, maintaining safe distance.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Stationary, poses no risk given the current trajectories.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 30796.0
- Distance Risk reason:  In the same lanelet and rapidly approaching from behind.  Closing distance and ego is decelerating faster.
- Distance safety score: 1
- Time Risk reason: High closing velocity due to large velocity difference, increasing risk over time.
- Time safety score: 1
- Overall Risk score: 1

- Obstacle ID: 30819.0
- Distance Risk reason: Located in a different lanelet and poses no immediate risk.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason:  Consistent lateral separation and no concerning closing velocity.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 30841.0
- Distance Risk reason: Laterally separated and slow-moving; minimal risk.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason:  Large lateral separation and slow relative velocity; minimal risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 4

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
Obstacle 30796.0 is approaching rapidly from behind in the same lanelet while the ego vehicle is decelerating. This poses an extreme risk of a rear-end collision in the near future. No other obstacles present immediate collision risk.
