Obstacle 30787 is laterally very close (1.66 m) but longitudinally aligned with the ego vehicle, posing some risk. However, its longitudinal relative velocity is small and moving away from the ego vehicle (-1.67 m/s), suggesting it might not be an immediate threat. It needs monitoring in subsequent timesteps to assess if it cuts into the ego vehicle's path.

Obstacle 30796 is longitudinally very close (-0.29 m) and behind the ego vehicle, with a high longitudinal relative velocity (6.70 m/s) towards the ego vehicle.  Although there is no lateral offset at this timestep, this obstacle poses a significant collision risk if its relative velocity does not significantly decrease. This obstacle requires the highest immediate attention.
