Let me analyze the most recent timestep (3.8 seconds) and assess collision risks for each obstacle:

1. Obstacle 30784 (Rear-left):
   - Adjusted distance: longitudinal -6.79m, lateral 12.67m
   - Moving away both longitudinally (-1.80m/s) and laterally (0.94m/s)
   - MDC: >5m in both dimensions
   - TTC: Not applicable (diverging paths)
   - Risk: 5 (No Risk)

2. Obstacle 30787 (Left):
   - Adjusted distance: longitudinal 0.00m, lateral 1.66m
   - Moving toward longitudinally (-1.67m/s), no lateral motion
   - MDC: 1.66m (lateral)
   - TTC: Not applicable for collision (lateral distance stable)
   - Risk: 4 (Low Risk - small lateral distance but stable)

3. Obstacle 30793 (Rear-left):
   - Adjusted distance: longitudinal -7.77m, lateral 21.10m
   - Moving away longitudinally (-1.67m/s), no lateral motion
   - MDC: >5m in both dimensions
   - TTC: Not applicable
   - Risk: 5 (No Risk)

4. Obstacle 30796 (Behind):
   - Adjusted distance: longitudinal -0.29m, lateral 0.00m
   - Approaching rapidly at 6.70m/s longitudinally
   - MDC: 0.29m (longitudinal)
   - TTC: 0.29/6.70 = 0.043s (extremely low)
   - Risk: 0 (Collision - both dimensions aligned with extremely small TTC)

5. Obstacle 30819 (Right):
   - Adjusted distance: longitudinal 0.00m, lateral -11.77m
   - Approaching laterally at 4.99m/s
   - MDC: 11.77m (lateral)
   - TTC: 11.77/4.99 = 2.36s
   - Risk: 3 (Medium Risk)

6. Obstacle 30841 (Front-left):
   - Adjusted distance: longitudinal 6.90m, lateral 1.31m
   - Approaching longitudinally (-2.13m/s), stable laterally
   - MDC: >5m longitudinally
   - TTC: 6.90/2.13 = 3.24s
   - Risk: 3 (Medium Risk)

Critical Findings:
- Obstacle 30796 is in direct rear alignment (lateral 0.00m) with only 0.29m longitudinal distance and approaching at 6.70m/s
- This gives an extremely low TTC of 0.043s
- The obstacle's trajectory shows consistent rapid approach from rear over multiple timesteps
- All other obstacles pose no immediate collision threat
