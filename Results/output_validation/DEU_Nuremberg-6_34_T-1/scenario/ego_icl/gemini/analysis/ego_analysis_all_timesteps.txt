* **Obstacle 30784 (Rear-left):**  This obstacle has been consistently moving away from the ego vehicle both longitudinally and laterally. At the last timestep, it is 6.79m behind and 12.67m to the left.  There is no risk of collision.  Risk Score: 5 (No Risk)

* **Obstacle 30787 (Left):** This obstacle is longitudinally aligned with the ego vehicle (0.00m) and 1.66m to the left at the last timestep. While the longitudinal velocity is negative (-1.67 m/s), indicating it's slightly moving away longitudinally, the small lateral distance warrants attention. Given the lateral distance and the consistent near-zero longitudinal distance across time steps, we calculate TTC based on lateral distance and velocity. However, since there's no lateral relative velocity provided, and the obstacle remains at a safe lateral distance, we classify this as low risk. Risk Score: 4 (Low Risk).

* **Obstacle 30793 (Rear-left):**  Similar to Obstacle 30784, this obstacle is moving away from the ego vehicle. At the last timestep, it is 7.77m behind and 21.10m to the left. There is no risk of collision. Risk Score: 5 (No Risk)

* **Obstacle 30796 (Behind):** This obstacle is approaching the ego vehicle from behind. At the last timestep, it is 0.29m behind and longitudinally aligned. The longitudinal velocity is positive (6.70 m/s), meaning it is rapidly closing in. The small longitudinal distance and high closing velocity indicate an extremely high risk of collision. TTC = 0.29m / 6.70m/s = 0.04s. This is an Extreme Risk scenario. Risk Score: 1 (Extreme Risk)

* **Obstacle 30819 (Right):** This obstacle is longitudinally aligned with the ego vehicle (0.00m) and 11.77m to the right. While the longitudinal velocity is negative (-4.20 m/s), the consistent longitudinal alignment over several timesteps, combined with some lateral movement, needs to be considered. Since it maintains a safe lateral distance, this is categorized as low risk.  Risk Score: 4 (Low Risk)

* **Obstacle 30841 (Front-left):** This obstacle is 6.90m in front and 1.31m to the left. It's approaching the ego vehicle longitudinally with a velocity of -2.13 m/s.  TTC = 6.90m / 2.13 m/s = 3.24s. This obstacle presents a medium risk. Risk Score: 3 (Medium Risk).


**Collision Scenario Determination:** Yes, this is a collision scenario. Obstacle 30796 poses an Extreme Risk (Risk Score 1) with a very low TTC (0.04s) and is very close to the ego vehicle (0.29m), approaching rapidly from behind.
