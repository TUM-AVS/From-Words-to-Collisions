Here's the detailed analysis for each obstacle at the most recent timestep (3.8 seconds):

### Obstacle-by-Obstacle Analysis:

**Obstacle 30784 (Rear-left):**
- **Adjusted Distances:** Longitudinal: -6.79 m, Lateral: 12.67 m 
- **Relative Velocities:** Longitudinal: -1.80 m/s, Lateral: 0.94 m/s
- **Trajectory:** Moving away from the ego car, both longitudinally and laterally.
- **MDC & TTC Calculations:**
  - MDC longitudinal: Moving away, so increasing distance, no immediate risk.
  - TTC: Not applicable as the obstacle is moving away.
- **Risk Assessment:**
  - Longitudinal distancing and away movement suggest no immediate collision risk.
  - Risk Score: 5 (No Risk)

**Obstacle 30787 (Left):**
- **Adjusted Distances:** Longitudinal: 0.00 m, Lateral: 1.66 m 
- **Relative Velocities:** Longitudinal: -1.67 m/s, Lateral: 0.00 m/s
- **Trajectory:** Exact longitudinal alignment; no lateral movement.
- **MDC & TTC Calculations:**
  - MDC lateral: 1.66 m; stable position, no rapid closing.
  - TTC: Not applicable for zero lateral velocity.
- **Risk Assessment:**
  - Stable positioning and zero lateral velocity mitigate collision concerns.
  - Risk Score: 5 (No Risk)

**Obstacle 30793 (Rear-left):**
- **Adjusted Distances:** Longitudinal: -7.77 m, Lateral: 21.10 m
- **Relative Velocities:** Longitudinal: -1.67 m/s, Lateral: 0.00 m/s
- **Trajectory:** Moving away, no lateral motion.
- **MDC & TTC Calculations:**
  - Qualitative analysis confirms increasing distance; no intervention needed.
- **Risk Assessment:**
  - Clearly moving away in both dimensions.
  - Risk Score: 5 (No Risk)

**Obstacle 30796 (Behind):**
- **Adjusted Distances:** Longitudinal: -0.29 m, Lateral: 0.00 m
- **Relative Velocities:** Longitudinal: 6.70 m/s, Lateral: -2.28 m/s
- **Trajectory:** Approaching directly from behind.
- **MDC & TTC Calculations:**
  - MDC longitudinal: Near zero, imminent collision threat if continued path.
  - TTC longitudinal: 0.29/6.70 ≈ 0.04 seconds, extremely minimal time to collision.
- **Risk Assessment:**
  - Immediate concern due to low longitudinal distance and very short TTC.
  - Risk Score: 1 (Extreme Risk)

**Obstacle 30819 (Right):**
- **Adjusted Distances:** Longitudinal: 0.00 m, Lateral: -11.77 m
- **Relative Velocities:** Longitudinal: -4.20 m/s, Lateral: 4.99 m/s
- **Trajectory:** Moving laterally toward the ego car.
- **MDC & TTC Calculations:**
  - Lateral movement leads to decreasing distance.
  - Continuous lateral motion suggests monitoring but no immediate risk.
- **Risk Assessment:**
  - Closing path primarily laterally but not yet critical.
  - Risk Score: 4 (Low Risk)

**Obstacle 30841 (Front-left):**
- **Adjusted Distances:** Longitudinal: 6.90 m, Lateral: 1.31 m
- **Relative Velocities:** Longitudinal: -2.13 m/s, Lateral: 0.00 m/s
- **Trajectory:** Approaching; specific path and lateral position stable.
- **MDC & TTC Calculations:**
  - Longitudinal MDT: Moderate; lateral stable, distance under 10m but safe.
  - TTC longitudinal: 6.90/-2.13 ≈ 3.24 seconds.
- **Risk Assessment:**
  - Moderate to low risk due to slower closure.
  - Risk Score: 4 (Low Risk)

### Collision Scenario Conclusion:

The analysis highlights **Obstacle 30796** as presenting an **Extreme Risk** with an imminent collision potential due to near-zero longitudinal distance and extremely short TTC. This contributes to a collision scenario based on risk criteria.
