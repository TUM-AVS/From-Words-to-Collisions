### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
    - Obstacle ID: 30784
    - Relative Direction: Rear-left
    - Distance Risk Reason: The obstacle is moving further away both longitudinally and laterally.  It poses no distance risk.
    - Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 5
    - Lateral Distance Safety Score: 5
    - Overall Distance Safety Score: 5.0
    - Time Risk Reason: The obstacle is moving away and poses no time-based risk.
    - Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 5
    - Lateral Time Safety Score: 5
    - Overall Time Safety Score: 5.0
    - Overall Risk Score: 5

    - Obstacle ID: 30787
    - Relative Direction: Left
    - Distance Risk Reason: DTClat shows the obstacle is at a safe lateral distance, even though it's now at the same longitudinal position.
    - Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 0
    - Lateral Distance Safety Score: 5
    - Overall Distance Safety Score: 5.0
    - Time Risk Reason: While laterally safe, TTClong indicates longitudinal collision is imminent.
    - Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 0
    - Lateral Time Safety Score: 5
    - Overall Time Safety Score: 5.0
    - Overall Risk Score: 5

    - Obstacle ID: 30793
    - Relative Direction: Rear-left
    - Distance Risk Reason:  The obstacle is moving away longitudinally and poses no lateral risk due to the large lateral distance.
    - Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 5
    - Lateral Distance Safety Score: 5
    - Overall Distance Safety Score: 5.0
    - Time Risk Reason: This obstacle is moving away and doesn't pose a risk in terms of time to collision.
    - Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 5
    - Lateral Time Safety Score: 5
    - Overall Time Safety Score: 5.0
    - Overall Risk Score: 5

    - Obstacle ID: 30796
    - Relative Direction: Behind
    - Distance Risk Reason: The obstacle is very close longitudinally and poses an extreme risk of rear-end collision.
    - Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 1
    - Lateral Distance Safety Score: 0
    - Overall Distance Safety Score: 1.0
    - Time Risk Reason: TTClong is extremely low, confirming the high risk of imminent rear-end collision.
    - Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 1
    - Lateral Time Safety Score: 0
    - Overall Time Safety Score: 1.0
    - Overall Risk Score: 1

    - Obstacle ID: 30819
    - Relative Direction: Right
    - Distance Risk Reason: The obstacle is laterally far away, posing no distance-based risk, despite being at the same longitudinal position.
    - Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 0
    - Lateral Distance Safety Score: 5
    - Overall Distance Safety Score: 5.0
    - Time Risk Reason: Laterally safe, but TTClat indicates a potential lateral collision risk, although not immediately imminent.
    - Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 0
    - Lateral Time Safety Score: 3
    - Overall Time Safety Score: 3.0
    - Overall Risk Score: 4

    - Obstacle ID: 30841
    - Relative Direction: Front-left
    - Distance Risk Reason:  The obstacle is at a safe longitudinal distance and moving slightly to the left, but the lateral distance is currently safe.
    - Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 5
    - Lateral Distance Safety Score: 5
    - Overall Distance Safety Score: 5
    - Time Risk Reason: TTClong indicates the obstacle is approaching but not imminently, and lateral motion is minimal.
    - Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 4
    - Lateral Time Safety Score: 5
    - Overall Time Safety Score: 4.5
    - Overall Risk Score: 5
