Analysis:

Both Ego and Obstacle 20071 are in the same lanelet (1040).  Over the provided timesteps, the obstacle is consistently ahead of the ego vehicle but the distance between them is decreasing. While the obstacle's velocity is higher than the ego vehicle's, both vehicles' decelerations in the last steps suggest they are slowing down, and reducing the risk of a collision. At the last timestamp (7.2 seconds), there was still a substantial distance between the vehicles. There are no immediate collisions or extreme risks in the given data. It is worth noting that without the precise dimensions of the vehicles or additional context, an exact safety margin calculation isn't possible. However, based on the given trajectories and speeds, we can assess the risk. Therefore, we evaluate Obstacle 20071 as a medium risk (3) based on the closing distance and current speeds, though additional data may change that.
