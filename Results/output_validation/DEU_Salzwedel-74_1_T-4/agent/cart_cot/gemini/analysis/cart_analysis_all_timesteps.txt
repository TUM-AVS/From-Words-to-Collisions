At t=7.2s, the ego vehicle is at (56.2062, -157.5715) with a velocity of 8.6818 m/s and the obstacle 20071.0 is at (59.9673, -160.8708) with velocity 12.8195 m/s.  The obstacle is ahead and slightly to the left of the ego vehicle. The obstacle's velocity is higher than the ego vehicle's, however, it appears to be decreasing as its acceleration is negative in this time step.

The distance between the two is approximately 4.8 meters.  While the recent change in the obstacle's acceleration is noteworthy, it's important to assess the risk based on the current trends.  A simple linear extrapolation of the current positions and velocities suggests a possible collision. However, because we expect that the obstacle will slow down as its acceleration is negative, it reduces the near-term risk slightly. It is therefore important for the ego vehicle to closely monitor the obstacle's motion and be prepared to brake. This situation presents a medium risk.
