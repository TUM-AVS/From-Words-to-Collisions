### Brief Analysis for Risky Obstacles

In this scenario, both the ego vehicle and the obstacle 20071.0 are in the same lanelet (1040.0) and moving with considerable speeds. As of the last known timestep at 7.2 seconds, both entities are maintaining their trajectory with slight velocity adjustments. The relative positions indicate that the obstacle is consistently ahead of the ego, diverging in terms of lateral positioning but still within a narrow corridor due to shared lanelet. This suggests a potentially high-risk but manageable situation. 

Calculating the distance at 7.2 seconds, the ego at position (56.2062, -157.5715) and obstacle at (59.9673, -160.8708) gives a Euclidean separation of approximately 4.284 meters. The primary concern here is the continual reduction in separation distance.

Given the consistent decrease in distances without a meaningful chance for evasive action if the trend continues, the scenario shifts toward an increased risk category. Yet, immediate collision is not calculated as unavoidable, because the speeds and positions suggest separated trajectories.

Thus, the overall risk is classified as High Risk: Close to collision, needing urgent action but not collision or extreme risk (score 2).
