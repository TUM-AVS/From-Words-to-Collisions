### Analysis:

1. **Relative Motion**:
   - The ego vehicle (20069.0) is decelerating slightly, with a velocity of ~8.68 m/s and a small negative acceleration (-0.0476 m/s² at the last timestep).
   - The obstacle (20071.0) is moving faster (~12.82 m/s) and is decelerating slightly (-0.0254 m/s² at the last timestep).
   - Both are in the same lanelet (1040.0), indicating a potential same-lane conflict.

2. **Distance and TTC**:
   - At 7.2s:
     - Ego position: (56.2062, -157.5715)
     - Obstacle position: (59.9673, -160.8708)
     - Euclidean distance: ~4.48 m (calculated as sqrt((59.9673-56.2062)² + (-160.8708 - (-157.5715))²))
   - Relative velocity: Obstacle is closing in at ~4.14 m/s (12.8195 - 8.6818).
   - TTC: ~1.08 s (4.48 / 4.14). This is a short time to collision, indicating high risk.

3. **Heading and Trajectory**:
   - The obstacle's orientation (2.4227) is very close to the ego's orientation (2.423975614731812), confirming they are moving in nearly the same direction.
   - The lateral distance is minimal (same lanelet), so the risk of collision is high.

### Risk Assessment:
- The obstacle (20071.0) is approaching the ego vehicle from behind at a high relative speed with a TTC of ~1.08 s. This is an **Extreme Risk (1)** scenario because a collision is likely and imminent if no evasive action is taken.
