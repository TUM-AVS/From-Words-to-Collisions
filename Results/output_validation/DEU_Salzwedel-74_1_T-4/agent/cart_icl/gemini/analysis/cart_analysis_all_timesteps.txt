At t=7.2s, the ego vehicle is at (56.2062, -157.5715) with a velocity of 8.6818 m/s and the obstacle 20071.0 is at (59.9673, -160.8708) with a velocity of 12.8195 m/s.  The obstacle is ahead and to the left of the ego vehicle.

The distance between the ego and the obstacle is approximately 4.8 meters. The relative velocity suggests the obstacle is moving faster than the ego vehicle. However, the data shows both vehicles are located in the same lanelet (1040.0), and the obstacle's x-coordinate is greater than the ego's but the closing rate is concerning. Further analysis is needed with more future timesteps to determine if a lane change is imminent by the obstacle. The reduction in acceleration of both vehicles during the last timestep also adds some complexity to determine the risk but based on the limited available data an assumption must be made.

Given the current information, the risk level is categorized as High (2) due to the proximity and closing velocity between the vehicles in the same lane.
