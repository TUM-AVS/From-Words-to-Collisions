To assess the collision risk between the ego vehicle and the obstacle at each timestep, let's analyze their positions, velocities, and changes over the given period. 

### Analysis:

1. **Relative Position and Velocity at Latest Timestep (7.2 seconds):**
   - **Ego Position:** (56.2062, -157.5715)
   - **Obstacle Position:** (59.9673, -160.8708)

2. **Relative Distance and Velocity:**
   - **Lateral Distance (Y-axis):** |(-160.8708) - (-157.5715)| = 3.2993 meters
   - **Longitudinal Distance (X-axis):** |59.9673 - 56.2062| = 3.7611 meters
   - **Total Distance:** √((3.2993)^2 + (3.7611)^2) ≈ 5.003 meters

   - **Ego Velocity:** 8.6818 m/s
   - **Obstacle Velocity:** 12.8195 m/s

3. **Velocity Components:**
   - Relative Longitudinal Velocity: Obstacle is faster than Ego → 12.8195 - 8.6818 = 4.1377 m/s

4. **TTC and MDC:**
   - **Time to Collision (TTC):** 5.003 meters / 4.1377 m/s ≈ 1.21 seconds
   - **Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC):** With lanes mostly consistent and close proximity, the MDC is approximately the current distance (5.003 meters).

5. **Risk Level Evaluation:**
   - At 7.2 seconds, the vehicle is quite close laterally and longitudinally, both in the same lanelet (1040.0). The obstacle's faster speed and proximity give rise to a high risk of collision if no action is taken.
   - With a TTC less than 1.5 seconds, it indicates an urgent need for evasive maneuvers or system intervention to avoid a collision.

### Conclusion:
Based on the TTC and MDC calculations, we can determine the risk level:
- **High Risk**: The obstacle is on a potentially colliding course if relative velocities are maintained and no action is taken (closer to collision with need for urgent action, therefore a level 2 risk).
