At t=7.2s, obstacle 20071 is behind the ego vehicle with a longitudinal distance of -0.5m, meaning it is very close.  The relative longitudinal velocity is 4.14 m/s, indicating it is approaching the ego vehicle rapidly. While the relative longitudinal acceleration is slightly negative (-0.02 m/sÂ²), the small distance and high relative velocity suggest a very high risk of collision in the immediate future. The lateral distance and relative lateral velocity are approximately zero, meaning there's no significant lateral movement.

Risk Levels:
0: Collision - Physical contact occurred or unavoidable
1: Extreme Risk - Immediate collision likely
2: High Risk - Close to collision, needs quick action
3: Medium Risk - Manageable with proper reaction
4: Low Risk - Minimal risk, sufficient time to react
5: Negligible Risk - No significant risk
