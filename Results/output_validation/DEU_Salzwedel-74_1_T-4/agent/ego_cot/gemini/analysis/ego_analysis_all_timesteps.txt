### Safety analysis for timestep 7.2 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:
- **Obstacle ID:** 20071
- **Distance Risk reason:** At the last timestep (7.2s), Obstacle 20071 is extremely close to the ego vehicle.  It is located behind the ego vehicle with a longitudinal distance of -0.50m and a lateral distance of -0.50m. This close proximity indicates an extremely high risk of collision. Since the obstacle is approaching from behind and slightly to the side, the lateral distance also poses a significant risk as it might lead to a sideswipe collision if the ego vehicle were to maneuver laterally.
- **Distance safety score:** 1 (Extreme Risk)
- **Time Risk reason:**  Given the closing longitudinal velocity of 4.14 m/s and the current distance of -0.50m, a collision is imminent if the relative velocity isn't significantly altered.  A simple calculation (-0.50m / 4.14m/s) suggests a TTC of roughly 0.12 seconds, indicating an extremely short time to react. While the lateral velocity is negligible, the primary concern is the rapidly closing longitudinal distance.
- **Time safety score:** 1 (Extreme Risk)
- **Overall Risk score:** 1 (Extreme Risk)
