### Obstacle-by-Obstacle Analysis:

#### **Obstacle 20071** (Most Recent Timestep at 7.2s):
- **Position**: Behind ego (longitudinal = -0.50 m, lateral = 0.00 m)
- **Relative Velocity**: longitudinal = 4.14 m/s (approaching), lateral = -0.02 m/s (negligible)
- **Motion**: Driving toward ego from behind with exact lateral alignment.

**Trajectory Analysis**:
- Longitudinal distance decreases from -4.17 m to -0.50 m over 0.9s (closing rapidly).
- Lateral distance remains at 0.00 m (same lane alignment).
- Relative velocity is high (~4.14 m/s) and increasing slightly (acceleration = -0.02 m/s², meaning deceleration is minimal).

**TTC Calculation**:
- Longitudinal TTC = 0.50 m / 4.14 m/s ≈ **0.12 seconds** (Extreme Risk, TTC ≤ 0.5s).
- Lateral TTC = Not applicable (lateral velocity is negligible).

**MDC Calculation**:
- Longitudinal MDC = 0.50 m (Extreme Risk, MDC ≤ 0.5m).
- Lateral MDC = 0.00 m (but no lateral movement, so not a collision risk alone).

**Risk Assessment**:
- Longitudinal: Extreme Risk (TTC = 0.12s, MDC = 0.50m).
- Lateral: Negligible Risk (no significant lateral movement).
- **Overall Risk Score**: **0 (Collision)** – The obstacle is about to collide with the ego vehicle from behind within the next timestep.

### Final JSON Summary:
```json
{
    "CollisionObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "20071",
        "OverallRiskScore": "0"
    },
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "20071",
        "OverallRiskScore": "0"
    },
    "PredictedCollisionObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "20071",
        "OverallRiskScore": "0"
    }
}
```

### Reasoning:
- **Collision is imminent** (Risk 0) because:
  - The longitudinal distance is critically small (0.50m) and closing rapidly (TTC ≈ 0.12s).
  - The lateral alignment (0.00m) means the obstacle is directly behind the ego in the same lane.
  - The relative velocity (4.14 m/s) ensures collision in the next timestep unless evasive action is taken immediately.
- No other obstacles are present in this scenario. The JSON reflects the highest risk (collision) for Obstacle 20071.
