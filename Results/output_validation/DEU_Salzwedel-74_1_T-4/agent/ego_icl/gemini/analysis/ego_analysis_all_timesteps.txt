Obstacle 20071 is behind the ego vehicle and approaching rapidly.  The longitudinal distance has decreased from -4.17m to -0.50m over the past 0.9 seconds, indicating a high closing velocity. The lateral distance remains at 0.00m throughout, signifying alignment in the same lane.

At the last timestep (7.2 seconds):
- Longitudinal distance: -0.50m
- Lateral distance: 0.00m
- Longitudinal relative velocity: 4.14 m/s (approaching)
- Lateral relative velocity: -0.02 m/s

TTC Calculation:
- Longitudinal TTC = |-0.50m| / 4.14 m/s â‰ˆ 0.12 seconds

MDC Calculation:
Since the obstacle is directly behind and in the same lane, MDC is primarily determined by the longitudinal distance, which is -0.50m.

Risk Assessment:
- TTC (0.12 seconds) indicates Extreme Risk (1).
- MDC (0.50 meters) indicates Extreme Risk (1).

Overall Risk: Extreme Risk (1) - Imminent collision likely.
