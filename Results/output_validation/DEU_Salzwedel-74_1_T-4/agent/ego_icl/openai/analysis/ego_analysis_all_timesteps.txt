### Obstacle Analysis

#### Obstacle 20071

**Trajectory Analysis:**
The obstacle 20071 is consistently closing in on the ego vehicle from behind, as evidenced by the decrement in longitudinal distances (-4.17 m to -0.50 m) over the series of timestamps. The lateral distance remains consistently at 0.00 m, suggesting the obstacle is directly aligned with the ego vehicle in the same lane. The longitudinal component of velocity is persistently positive, which indicates that the obstacle is indeed approaching the ego vehicle.

**Time-to-Collision (TTC) Calculation:**
- At the most recent timestep (7.2 seconds), the longitudinal distance is -0.50 m and the relative velocity is 4.14 m/s.
- TTC = |Distance| / Relative Velocity = 0.50 m / 4.14 m/s = ~0.121 seconds.

**Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC):**
- The adjusted longitudinal distance at 7.2 seconds is -0.50 m, and the lateral distance remains 0.00 m, meaning trajectory lines suggest a very close approach.

**Analysis:**
- With a TTC of approximately 0.121 seconds, this falls well below the 0.5-second extreme risk threshold.
- MDC at this interval is also very small, nearly leading to an unavoidable collision due to the persistent alignment and closing speed.

**Conclusion:**
Obstacle 20071 is at extreme risk of collision with very little time to counteract the trajectory unless immediate evasive action is taken. The relative acceleration is slightly negative longitudinally, hinting at a marginal deceleration which insufficiently impacts the assessment in this high-risk proximity.
