At t=7.4s, Ego is at (54.8981, -156.4301) with velocity 8.6454 m/s and Obstacle 20071 is at (58.0382, -159.1827) with velocity 12.8144 m/s. Both are in the same lanelet (1040).  The obstacle is ahead and to the left of the ego vehicle.

The distance between Ego and Obstacle 20071 at t=7.4s is approximately 4.74 meters.  Examining the trajectories from t=6.5s to t=7.4s reveals that the obstacle is approaching the ego vehicle rapidly, while the ego vehicle is decelerating.  This closing distance, combined with the velocity difference, suggests a high risk of collision in the very near future. While not an immediate collision at t=7.4, the risk is extreme (level 1) due to the high probability of collision in the next few timesteps if the current trajectories continue.

    "Reasoning": "Obstacle 20071 poses an extreme risk of collision with Ego in the next timestep(s) due to rapidly decreasing inter-vehicle distance and velocity differences within the same lanelet.  At t=7.4s, a collision is not yet imminent, but highly probable unless evasive action is taken immediately."
