At t=7.4s, the ego vehicle is at (54.8981, -156.4301) with a velocity of 8.6454 m/s and the obstacle (20071.0) is at (58.0382, -159.1827) with a velocity of 12.8144 m/s. Both are in the same lanelet (1040.0).

The obstacle is ahead of the ego vehicle and closing quickly. The ego vehicle is decelerating more aggressively than the obstacle.  While a collision isn't guaranteed in the next instant, the closing speed and proximity warrant an extreme risk assessment. The distance between them is approximately 4.7 meters. Given their speeds and the ego's deceleration rate, a collision is highly likely within the next second if the current trajectories continue.
