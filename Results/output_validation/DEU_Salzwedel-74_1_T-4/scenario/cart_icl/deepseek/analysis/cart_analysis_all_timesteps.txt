### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. **Ego Vehicle**: Moving at 8.6454 m/s, decelerating slightly (a=-0.1324).
2. **Obstacles**: All obstacles are behind the ego vehicle, with the closest being 20071.0 at -159.1827 Y (still far). 
3. **Trajectories**: No obstacles are on a direct collision path with the ego based on historical movement.
4. **Risk Assessment**: No immediate collision risk. All obstacles are either static or moving away from the ego's path.
