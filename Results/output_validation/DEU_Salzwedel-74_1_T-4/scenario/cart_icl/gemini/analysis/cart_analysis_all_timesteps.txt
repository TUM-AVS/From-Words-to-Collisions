### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 20071.0
- Distance Risk reason: The obstacle is in the same lane and approaching the ego vehicle.  At the latest timestep, the distance has decreased significantly, now less than 4 meters apart.
- Distance safety score: 1
- Time Risk reason: The obstacle's velocity is higher than the ego vehicle's. The ego vehicle is decelerating while the obstacle is also decelerating but with less deceleration rate. This relative motion suggests a very high risk of collision in the near future.
- Time safety score: 1
- Overall Risk score: 1

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. **Initial Observation**:  The obstacle and ego vehicle are in the same lanelet.
2. **Trajectory Analysis**: Over the past several timesteps, the distance between the two has been decreasing.
3. **Velocity Analysis**: The obstacle's velocity is consistently higher than the ego vehicle's, meaning it is closing the gap. Although both are now decelerating, the closing rate is still high.
4. **Collision Imminence**: Given the proximity and the closing rate, a near-term collision is highly likely.
