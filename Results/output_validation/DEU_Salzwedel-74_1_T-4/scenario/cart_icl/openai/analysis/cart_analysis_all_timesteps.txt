### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep:
Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:
- **Obstacle ID:** 20071.0
- **Distance Risk reason:** At the most recent timestep, the obstacle is located at (58.0382, -159.1827) and is in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle. The distance between the ego vehicle and the obstacle is shrinking over time. At 7.4 seconds, the obstacle is approximately 3.4 meters away from the ego vehicle. Considering the change in position over time, the obstacle is on a likely collision path but still maintains a small distance allowing potential maneuvering.
- **Distance safety score:** 2
- **Time Risk reason:** The obstacle has a higher velocity (12.8144 m/s) than the ego vehicle (8.6454 m/s), indicating it is approaching the ego vehicleâ€™s position quickly. The positive acceleration before 7.2 seconds suggests a previous increase in speed, which has stabilized to a slight deceleration, yet maintains a high speed relative to the ego.
- **Time safety score:** 2
- **Overall Risk score:** 2

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. The obstacle and the ego vehicle are both in the same lanelet.
2. The distance between the ego and the obstacle has decreased over time, indicating a potential future collision if no actions are taken.
3. The velocity and acceleration trends show the obstacle approaching the ego vehicle's position rapidly.
4. The analysis of the historical trajectory suggests that the obstacle is consistently moving towards the ego vehicle.
5. Despite the decreasing distance, there is still a small gap, allowing potential time for maneuvering. However, due to the high relative speed disadvantage, the risk remains significant.
