### Safety analysis for timestep 6.5s - 7.4s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:
- **Obstacle ID:** 20071
- **Distance Risk reason:** The obstacle is approaching the ego vehicle from behind, with the longitudinal distance decreasing from -3.36m to 0m and lateral distance decreasing from -3.36m to 0m over the time steps.  This indicates a high risk of collision.
- **Distance safety score:** 1 (Extreme Risk)
- **Time Risk reason:** The relative longitudinal velocity is positive, indicating the obstacle is closing in on the ego vehicle. The decreasing distance combined with the relative velocity suggests a very short time to collision.  The collision occurs at 7.4 seconds.
- **Time safety score:** 1 (Extreme Risk)
- **Overall Risk score:** 1 (Extreme Risk - imminent collision)
