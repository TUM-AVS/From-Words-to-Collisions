### Obstacle-by-Obstacle Analysis (Most Recent Timestep: 7.4s)

**Obstacle 20071:**
- **Position:** Collision (longitudinal 0.00m, lateral 0.00m)
- **Relative Velocity:** Longitudinal 4.17 m/s (approaching), Lateral -0.02 m/s (negligible)
- **Motion Description:** Exact longitudinal alignment (collision occurring)
- **Trajectory Analysis:**
  - From 6.5s to 7.4s, the obstacle rapidly closes the longitudinal distance from -3.36m to 0.00m at ~4.1 m/s relative velocity.
  - Lateral distance remains 0.00m (perfect alignment) with negligible lateral velocity.
  - The obstacle's longitudinal acceleration is slightly negative (-0.08 m/sÂ²), but the closing speed remains high enough to cause a collision.

### TTC and MDC Calculations:
1. **Time-to-Collision (TTC):**
   - Longitudinal TTC = 0.00m / 4.17 m/s = **0.00s** (collision occurring)
   - Lateral TTC = N/A (no lateral closing velocity)
   - **TTC Risk:** 0 (Collision)

2. **Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC):**
   - Longitudinal MDC = 0.00m (collision)
   - Lateral MDC = 0.00m (collision)
   - **MDC Risk:** 0 (Collision)

### Risk Assessment:
- **Overall Risk Score:** 0 (Collision occurring)
  - Both TTC and MDC confirm a collision (distance = 0.00m in both dimensions with closing velocity).

### Collision Scenario Determination:
This is a **collision scenario** because:
1. Obstacle 20071 has a collision risk score of 0 (actual collision at 7.4s).
2. The obstacle's longitudinal distance reaches 0.00m with significant closing velocity (4.17 m/s), and lateral alignment is perfect (0.00m).
