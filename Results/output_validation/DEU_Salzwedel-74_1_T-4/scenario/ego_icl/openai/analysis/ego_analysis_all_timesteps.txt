### Obstacle Analysis: Obstacle 20071

#### Trajectory Analysis
- Obstacle 20071 is consistently approaching the ego vehicle from behind over the timesteps.
- Longitudinal distances have been decreasing, indicating a closing gap: starting from -3.36 meters at 6.5 seconds to 0.00 meters by 7.4 seconds.
- The lateral distance remains at 0.00 meters throughout, indicating that the obstacle is aligned in the same lane as the ego vehicle.
- Relative longitudinal velocity is consistently positive and increasing slightly, indicating the obstacle is gaining on the ego vehicle.
- Relative lateral velocity alternates slightly but does not significantly affect alignment.
- Relative accelerations suggest a minor slowing trend in lateral movement but constant forward approaching in longitudinal direction.

#### Calculation at 7.4 Seconds (Most Recent Timestamp)
- Longitudinal distance: 0.00 meters (collision point)
- Lateral distance: 0.00 meters (same-lane alignment)

**Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC):**
- Longitudinal MDC = 0.00 m
- Lateral MDC = 0.00 m
- Spatial analysis suggests that the obstacle is in the same exact position as the ego vehicle, indicating a collision.

**Time-to-Collision (TTC):**
- Given that the ego and obstacle are at the same position (longitudinal and lateral distances are 0.00m), TTC is effectively 0 seconds.

#### Risk Assessment
- The longitudinal distance is at 0.00 meters with a closing velocity (4.17 m/s longitudinally), and the lateral distance is aligned at 0.00 meters. 
- Identified as a collision since both dimensions have zero distance, and approach velocities confirm immediate contact.

### Conclusion
This scenario is a collision scenario because Obstacle 20071 meets the criteria for a risk score of 0, indicating a collision is currently occurring.
