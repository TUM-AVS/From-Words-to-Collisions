Obstacle 20016: This obstacle is stationary and far from the ego vehicle's trajectory, posing no risk. Risk score: 5 (Negligible Risk)

Obstacle 20025: This obstacle is stationary and far from the ego vehicle's trajectory, posing no risk. Risk score: 5 (Negligible Risk)

Obstacle 20029: This obstacle is in the same lane as the ego vehicle and moving faster than the ego vehicle. The distance between them is decreasing over time. While not an immediate collision, the rapidly closing distance and speed difference indicate a high risk of collision if both vehicles maintain their current trajectories and velocities. Risk score: 2 (High Risk)

Obstacle 20031: This obstacle is in a different lane and its trajectory does not intersect with the ego vehicle's path. While initially somewhat close, it's moving slower and eventually farther away from the ego vehicle. Risk score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
