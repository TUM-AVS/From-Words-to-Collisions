Obstacle 20029 is in the same lane as the ego vehicle and rapidly approaching from behind with a much higher velocity (8.4393 vs 4.2348).  This represents a high risk of collision if the ego vehicle were to slow down or stop suddenly. The closing velocity is substantial and the relative positions suggest a potential collision within the next few seconds.

Obstacle 20031 is in the adjacent lane and moving slower than the ego vehicle. Although the distance is not extremely large, the differing velocities and directions of travel suggest a low risk of collision.

Obstacle 20025, also in the adjacent lane, is stationary and poses no immediate risk. Obstacle 20016 is far behind and stationary, posing no risk.
