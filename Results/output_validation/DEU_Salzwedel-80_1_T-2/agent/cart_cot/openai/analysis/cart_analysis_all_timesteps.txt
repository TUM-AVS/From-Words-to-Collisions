### Analysis:

1. **Obstacle 20016.0** and **Obstacle 20025.0**: These are stationary throughout the observed time. Their positions remain constant and far from the Ego vehicle, hence negligible risk.
   
2. **Obstacle 20029.0**: It is moving within the same lanelet as the Ego vehicle and consistently increases its velocity. At the last timestamp, it is at position (-6.8201, 39.8784). Given its rising velocity (8.4393 m/s) and acceleration, it approaches the Ego vehicle rapidly. The relative motion suggests a decreasing distance, which could lead to a possible collision. Significant risk present.

3. **Obstacle 20031.0**: Continuously decelerates with a very low velocity (0.1624 m/s at the last timestamp) and is positioned within a different lanelet, implying less interaction risk with the Ego vehicle.

#### Conclusion:
- Obstacle 20029.0 poses the highest risk to the Ego vehicle due to its trajectory and velocity increase. Hence, it is considered as an **Extreme Risk Obstacle** with potential for imminent collision if no action is taken.
