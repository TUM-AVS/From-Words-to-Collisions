Obstacle 20029 is in the same lane as the ego vehicle and rapidly approaching from behind.  At the last timestep (12.9s), Obstacle 20029 is approximately 15 meters behind the ego vehicle, but its velocity (8.44 m/s) is significantly higher than the ego vehicle's velocity (4.23 m/s). Its acceleration also suggests it is continuing to gain speed. These factors combined creates a very high risk of collision in the immediate future.
