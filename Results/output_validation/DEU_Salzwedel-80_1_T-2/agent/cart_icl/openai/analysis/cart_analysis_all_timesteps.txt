### Analysis

#### Initial Considerations
- Focus on the most recent snapshot (12.9 seconds).
- Ego vehicle is moving at a steady speed with no acceleration, traveling in lanelet 2629.
- Obstacles are in different lanes, with different speeds and accelerations.

#### Obstacle Analysis
- **Obstacle 20016.0**: Stationary at all times, located in lanelet 2630. No risk as it doesnâ€™t pose any collision threat due to the stationary state and different lane.
  
- **Obstacle 20025.0**: Stationary, consistently in lanelet 2630. Similar to 20016.0, poses no immediate risk to the ego vehicle given location in a different lane and lack of movement.

- **Obstacle 20029.0**:
  - Located in lanelet 2629, the same as the ego vehicle, moving at a high velocity of 8.4393 m/s.
  - The trajectory is closing distance towards the ego vehicle.
  - Since both are in the same lane and its speed is higher, it should be closely monitored for any swift decision-making.
  - Despite the velocity, since there's no immediate indication of an imminent collision, this is considered **Medium Risk**.

- **Obstacle 20031.0**: Moving slowly with an initial position still away from the ego vehicle's lane (lanelet 2630). Given its velocity and separate lane, it presents no immediate threat.

#### Collision Metrics
Using the most recent timestep:
- **TTC Calculation** for encountering obstacles is only applicable to **Obstacle 20029.0** as it shares Ego's lanelet. However, the distance it covers over time avoids immediate collision.
- **MDC** for **Obstacle 20029.0**: Continuous increase in velocity and proximity to the Ego, primarily impactful due to shared lanelets, but manageable at current speeds over observed sample period.

### Summary
- **Extreme or Collision** scenarios were not present based on the observed data
- Continuous monitoring is required for any change in lane or velocity, especially for **Obstacle 20029.0**
