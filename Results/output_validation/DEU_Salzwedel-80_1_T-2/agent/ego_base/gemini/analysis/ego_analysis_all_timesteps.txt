Obstacle 20016: This obstacle is moving away from the ego vehicle longitudinally and poses no immediate risk. Risk score: 5 (Negligible Risk).

Obstacle 20025: Similar to 20016, this obstacle is also moving away longitudinally and does not present any risk. Risk score: 5 (Negligible Risk).

Obstacle 20029: This obstacle is approaching the ego vehicle from behind and is now very close (longitudinal distance -0.58m).  Given its speed and closing rate, a collision is highly likely in the next few moments. Risk score: 1 (Extreme Risk).

Obstacle 20031:  While this obstacle is moving away laterally, it is also slightly behind the ego vehicle now (longitudinal distance -0.74m). Although not as immediately dangerous as 20029, it's still relatively close. Risk score: 2 (High Risk).
