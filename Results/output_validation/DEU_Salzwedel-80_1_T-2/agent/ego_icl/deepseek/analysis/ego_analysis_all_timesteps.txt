Let me analyze each obstacle at the most recent timestep (12.9 seconds) and assess collision risks:

1. Obstacle 20016 (Rear-left):
   - Adjusted distances: longitudinal -16.68m, lateral 2.02m
   - Relative velocity: longitudinal -4.23m/s (moving away), lateral 0.00m/s
   - MDC: Lateral distance is stable at ~2.02m (Low Risk)
   - TTC: Not applicable (moving away in longitudinal)
   - Overall Risk: 5 (Negligible Risk)

2. Obstacle 20025 (Rear-left):
   - Adjusted distances: longitudinal -7.75m, lateral 1.89m
   - Relative velocity: longitudinal -4.23m/s (moving away), lateral 0.00m/s
   - MDC: Lateral distance is stable at ~1.89m (Low Risk)
   - TTC: Not applicable (moving away in longitudinal)
   - Overall Risk: 5 (Negligible Risk)

3. Obstacle 20029 (Behind):
   - Adjusted distances: longitudinal -0.58m, lateral 0.00m
   - Relative velocity: longitudinal 4.20m/s (approaching), lateral -0.00m/s
   - MDC: Longitudinal distance is critical (0.58m) - Extreme Risk
   - TTC: 0.58m / 4.20m/s = 0.138s (Extreme Risk)
   - This obstacle is about to collide with the ego vehicle from behind
   - Overall Risk: 0 (Collision)

4. Obstacle 20031 (Rear-left):
   - Adjusted distances: longitudinal -0.74m, lateral 1.89m
   - Relative velocity: longitudinal -4.40m/s (moving away), lateral 0.00m/s
   - MDC: Lateral distance is stable at 1.89m (Low Risk)
   - TTC: Not applicable (moving away in longitudinal)
   - Overall Risk: 5 (Negligible Risk)

Trajectory Analysis:
- Obstacle 20029 shows consistent approach from behind with decreasing longitudinal distance
- From 12.0s to 12.9s, distance reduced from -5.96m to -0.58m at increasing speed (3.23m/s to 4.20m/s)
- Lateral alignment remains perfect (0.00m) throughout
- Will collide with ego vehicle in next timestep
