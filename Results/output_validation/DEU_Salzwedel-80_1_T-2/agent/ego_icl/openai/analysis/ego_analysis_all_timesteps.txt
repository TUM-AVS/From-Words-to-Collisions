### Obstacle Analysis

**Obstacle 20016**
- **Position**: Rear-left
- **Adjusted Distances**: Longitudinal -16.68 m, Lateral 2.02 m
- **Velocities**: Longitudinal -4.23 m/s (moving away), Lateral 0.00 m/s
- **Trajectory**: Consistently moving away from the ego vehicle, increasing distance over time.
- **TTC and MDC Analysis**:
  - As the obstacle is moving away, the TTC is not applicable (diverging paths).
  - MDC is not applicable as there is no risk of collision.

**Risk Level**: 5 (Negligible Risk)

**Obstacle 20025**
- **Position**: Rear-left
- **Adjusted Distances**: Longitudinal -7.75 m, Lateral 1.89 m
- **Velocities**: Longitudinal -4.23 m/s (moving away), Lateral 0.00 m/s
- **Trajectory**: Increasing distance from the ego, consistently moving away.
- **TTC and MDC Analysis**:
  - Again, no relevant TTC due to increasing separation.
  - MDC also does not apply due to the absence of converging movement.

**Risk Level**: 5 (Negligible Risk)

**Obstacle 20029**
- **Position**: Behind
- **Adjusted Distances**: Longitudinal -0.58 m, Lateral 0.00 m
- **Velocities**: Longitudinal 4.20 m/s (approaching), Lateral 0.00 m/s
- **Trajectory**: Approaching rapidly in the exact same lane.
- **TTC and MDC Analysis**:
  - **TTC Longitudinal**: ~0.58/4.20 â‰ˆ 0.14 seconds (very short time to collision).
  - **MDC**: Approaching in the same lane, collision likely unless paths change imminently.
  
**Risk Level**: 0 (Collision Imminent)

**Obstacle 20031**
- **Position**: Rear-left
- **Adjusted Distances**: Longitudinal -0.74 m, Lateral 1.89 m
- **Velocities**: Longitudinal -4.40 m/s, Lateral 0.00 m/s
- **Trajectory**: Moving away both longitudinally and laterally.
- **TTC and MDC Analysis**:
  - For lateral movement away, TTC does not indicate collision risk.
  - Stable increase in longitudinal distance indicates diverging paths.

**Risk Level**: 5 (Negligible Risk)

### Summary in JSON Format
