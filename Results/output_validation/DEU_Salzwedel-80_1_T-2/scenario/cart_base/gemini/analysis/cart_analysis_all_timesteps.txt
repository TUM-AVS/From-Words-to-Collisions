Obstacle 20029 is in the same lane as the ego vehicle and is rapidly approaching from behind.  At the last timestep, Obstacle 20029's position (-7.2576, 41.9566) is extremely close to the ego vehicle's position (-8.0436, 45.6889) given its high velocity (8.6445) and positive acceleration (0.9975). Although the y-coordinates show some separation, the x-coordinates suggest they are nearly side-by-side, making a lane change by the ego vehicle potentially dangerous. This situation presents an extreme risk of collision in the next few seconds. Other obstacles are in a different lanelet and are not considered immediate risks.
