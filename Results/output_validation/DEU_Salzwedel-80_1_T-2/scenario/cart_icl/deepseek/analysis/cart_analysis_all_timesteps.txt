### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. **Obstacle 20031.0** is the only obstacle showing extreme risk (score 1) due to its proximity (<1m) and movement towards the ego vehicle.
2. All other obstacles are either static, moving away, or at safe distances.
3. No actual collision has occurred yet (no score 0 obstacles).
4. The scenario is not a collision scenario but has one extreme risk situation.
