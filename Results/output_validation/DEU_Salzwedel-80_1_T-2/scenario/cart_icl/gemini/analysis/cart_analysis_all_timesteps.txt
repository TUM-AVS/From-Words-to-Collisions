- Distance Risk reason: In the same lanelet and rapidly approaching the ego vehicle. The distance is decreasing significantly over the timesteps.
- Distance safety score: 1
- Time Risk reason:  High velocity and positive acceleration, indicating it's closing in on the ego vehicle quickly. The risk is increasing.
- Time safety score: 1
- Overall Risk score: 1

- Obstacle ID: 20031.0
- Distance Risk reason: Located in a different lanelet and maintaining a safe distance. No risk observed during the provided timesteps.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason:  Moving slowly with negative acceleration. Moving away from the ego vehicle.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5


### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
Obstacle 20029.0 poses an extreme risk due to its high closing velocity, positive acceleration, and decreasing distance to the ego vehicle within the same lanelet.  While no collision is imminent in the next immediate timestep, the current trajectory suggests a high probability of collision in the very near future if no evasive action is taken.
