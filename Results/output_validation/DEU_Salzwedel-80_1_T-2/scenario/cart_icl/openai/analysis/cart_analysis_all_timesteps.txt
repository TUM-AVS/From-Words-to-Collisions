### Safety Analysis for the Most Recent Timestep (13.1 seconds):

#### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 20016.0**
  - **Distance Risk Reason**: Obstacle has remained stationary in a different lanelet from the ego vehicle throughout the entire observation period. The consistent position means no intersection trajectory.
  - **Distance Safety Score**: 5
  - **Time Risk Reason**: No velocity or acceleration; remains stationary hence no risk due to time factors.
  - **Time Safety Score**: 5
  - **Overall Risk Score**: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 20025.0**
  - **Distance Risk Reason**: Stationary obstacle in a different lanelet. The position has not changed over time, indicating no risk from occupying space.
  - **Distance Safety Score**: 5
  - **Time Risk Reason**: Zero velocity and acceleration imply no future collision based on time dynamics.
  - **Time Safety Score**: 5
  - **Overall Risk Score**: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 20029.0**
  - **Distance Risk Reason**: The obstacle shares the lanelet with the ego vehicle and is very close (approx. 3.73m behind at 13.1s), with consistent velocity increase, reducing distance constantly.
  - **Distance Safety Score**: 2
  - **Time Risk Reason**: Increasing velocity and acceleration while closing distance with the ego vehicle indicate possible future collision if trends continue.
  - **Time Safety Score**: 2
  - **Overall Risk Score**: 2

- **Obstacle ID: 20031.0**
  - **Distance Risk Reason**: Positioned far from the ego vehicle in a different lanelet. The position changes are minimal.
  - **Distance Safety Score**: 4
  - **Time Risk Reason**: Very low velocity with deceleration, diminishing the concern over time.
  - **Time Safety Score**: 4
  - **Overall Risk Score**: 4

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:

1. Analyzed trajectory and velocity of the ego vehicle and obstacles over 10 timesteps.
2. Obstacle 20029.0 is the only concern due to proximity and velocity trend, but it remains behind the ego vehicle without indicating immediate impact within the scenario window examined.
3. No signs of extreme or 0-risk (collision imminent) were found since immediate collision is unlikely given the spacing and calculated trajectory parameters.
