### Safety analysis for timestep 12.2-13.1s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

**- Obstacle ID: 20016**
- Distance Risk reason:  Located rear-left and moving away from the ego vehicle.  DTClong and DTClat are increasing and negative.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason:  No TTC concern as the obstacle is moving away.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

**- Obstacle ID: 20025**
- Distance Risk reason: Located rear-left and moving away from the ego vehicle. DTClong and DTClat are increasing and negative.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: No TTC concern as the obstacle is moving away.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

**- Obstacle ID: 20029**
- Distance Risk reason: Initially behind the ego vehicle, DTClong starts at -4.82m and decreases, indicating closing distance.  Collision occurs at 13.0s.
- Distance safety score: Initially 2, degrading to 0 at collision.
- Time Risk reason:  Positive closing velocity suggests a decreasing TTC.  Collision imminent.
- Time safety score: Initially 2, degrading to 0 at collision.
- Overall Risk score: Initially 2, degrading to 0 at collision.

**- Obstacle ID: 20031**
- Distance Risk reason: Located to the left of the ego vehicle initially, then moving to the rear-left. DTClat and DTClong values are either zero or becoming negative.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: No TTC concern as the obstacle is moving away laterally.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5


### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
  "CollisionObstacle": {
    "ObstacleID": "20029",
    "OverallRiskScore": "0"
  },
  "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null,
  "IsCollisionScenario": true,
  "Justification": "Obstacle 20029 collides with the ego vehicle at 13.0 seconds.  The DTClong becomes zero, and the 'Motion' description explicitly states 'Collision'."
}
