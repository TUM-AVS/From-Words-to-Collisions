Here's the collision risk analysis:

**Ego Vehicle (20055):** The ego vehicle is moving forward with a decreasing velocity and negative acceleration in lanelet 292.

**Obstacle 20020, 20023, 20025, and 20027:** These obstacles are static and located far from the ego vehicle's trajectory, posing no immediate risk. Risk score: 5 (Negligible Risk).

**Obstacle 20057:** This obstacle is also in lanelet 292, moving in the same direction as the ego vehicle but with higher velocity, which might cause a collision. Risk score: 2 (High Risk) initially. 

**Obstacle 20060:**  Static and positioned laterally away from the ego vehicle, presenting no risk. Risk score: 5 (Negligible Risk).

**Obstacle 20061:** This obstacle moves with a relatively high velocity in a different lanelet and does not intersect the ego vehicle's path. Risk score: 5 (Negligible Risk) initially.

**Obstacle 20072:** Slow-moving and laterally positioned to the ego vehicle, showing no risk. Risk score: 5 (Negligible Risk).


**Obstacle 20074, 20077 and 20080:** Located far from the ego vehicle's path. Risk score: 5 (Negligible Risk).

**Further Analysis of Obstacle 20057:**
Although Obstacle 20057 shares the same lanelet, its y-coordinate is decreasing significantly, while the ego vehicle's y-coordinate is increasing. From the provided trajectory, there are no signs of the y-coordinates converging, suggesting there is enough lateral separation to avoid a collision. Reclassifying risk to 4 (Low Risk) after considering the entire trajectory.
