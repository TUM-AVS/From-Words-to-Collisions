Obstacle 20057 is showing a concerning trend. It is in the same lane as the ego vehicle (lanelet 292) and rapidly approaching from behind with a higher velocity and positive acceleration. This poses a high risk of a rear-end collision if the ego vehicle decelerates or the obstacle continues to accelerate.  A precise TTC calculation is needed to determine the immediacy of the risk. However, based on the current information, a high risk level is warranted.
