### Analysis of Risky Obstacles:

1. **Obstacle 20057.0**:  
   - **Position**: (0.1068, -0.4427) at 4.7s, moving towards the ego vehicle.  
   - **Velocity**: 6.8072 m/s (approaching).  
   - **Relative Motion**: The obstacle is in the same lanelet (292.0) as the ego vehicle and is closing in rapidly.  
   - **TTC**: The relative distance is decreasing, and the obstacle is almost at the same longitudinal position as the ego vehicle.  
   - **Risk**: **Collision (0)** - The obstacle is on a direct collision course with the ego vehicle.

2. **Obstacle 20072.0**:  
   - **Position**: (-4.9377, -3.3977) at 4.7s, moving towards the ego vehicle.  
   - **Velocity**: 0.1628 m/s (approaching).  
   - **Relative Motion**: The obstacle is in lanelet 291.0, adjacent to the ego's lanelet (292.0).  
   - **TTC**: The relative distance is decreasing, but the lateral distance is significant.  
   - **Risk**: **High Risk (2)** - The obstacle is close but not on an immediate collision course.

3. **Obstacle 20061.0**:  
   - **Position**: (-7.8428, -18.932) at 4.7s, moving towards the ego vehicle.  
   - **Velocity**: 5.436 m/s (approaching).  
   - **Relative Motion**: The obstacle is in lanelet 499.0, not in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle.  
   - **TTC**: The relative distance is decreasing, but the lateral distance is significant.  
   - **Risk**: **Medium Risk (3)** - The obstacle is not on an immediate collision course.
