### Risk Assessment Analysis

At the latest timestep (4.7 seconds), we analyze each obstacle based on their movement and relative position to the ego vehicle.

#### Obstacle 20057.0:
- **Position:** (0.1068, -0.4427), **Velocity:** 6.8072 m/s, **Lanelet:** 292.0
- **Relative Position to Ego:** Very close proximity to ego in both x and y coordinates.
- **TTC:** The obstacle is fast approaching the ego vehicle from behind.
- **Risk Analysis:** High speed and close proximity within the same lanelet suggest a high risk of collision.
- **Assessment:** **Extreme Risk (1)** as the overall risk score.

#### General Observations for Other Obstacles:
- **Obstacles 20020.0, 20023.0, 20025.0, 20027.0, 20060.0, 20061.0, 20072.0, 20074.0, 20077.0, 20080.0** show negligible risk as they remain stationary or are far from the ego vehicle's projected path at the latest timestep.

### Conclusion

For Obstacle 20057.0, it presents an extreme risk situation (1) due to its fast approach and proximity to the ego vehicle within the same lanelet. There are no obstacles with a risk level of collision (0).
