At timestamp 4.7 seconds, Obstacle 20057 poses an extreme risk due to its proximity and impending collision with the ego vehicle.  The other obstacles do not pose an immediate threat.

Obstacle 20057: This obstacle is almost directly behind the ego vehicle at a distance of -0.76 meters, indicating extreme proximity and a very high likelihood of collision. The negative distance suggests it might already be slightly overlapping with the ego vehicle's rear boundary. Its relative longitudinal velocity of 3.10 m/s indicates it is rapidly closing the distance. This combination of proximity and closing velocity results in a very short TTC, likely below 0.5 seconds. Considering both MDC and TTC, the overall risk score for Obstacle 20057 is 1 (Extreme Risk).

Obstacles 20020, 20023, 20025, 20027: These obstacles are located in front-right of the ego vehicle, with longitudinal distances between 11.47 and 12.16 meters. Although they have a negative relative longitudinal velocity (approaching the ego vehicle), the distances are sufficient to allow ample reaction time. Therefore, they pose a low risk with individual scores of 4 or 5.

Obstacles 20060, 20072: These obstacles are located rear-left of the ego vehicle, with longitudinal distances between -5.49 and -12.45 meters and are moving away from the ego vehicle longitudinally.  They pose negligible risk, with individual scores of 5.

Obstacles 20074: This obstacles is located front-left of the ego vehicle, with a longitudinal distance of 10.55 meters and is moving towards the ego vehicle. This obstacle is assessed a risk score of 4 due to the distance and motion.

Obstacles 20061: This obstacle is behind the ego vehicle, with longitudinal distance of -20.88 meters, and is moving toward the ego vehicle.  The distance is sufficient enough to not cause concern, therefore it is assessed a risk score of 4 or 5.

Obstacles 20077, 20080: These obstacles are located rear-right of the ego vehicle, with longitudinal distances between -16.43 and -17.50 meters and are moving away from the ego vehicle longitudinally.  They pose negligible risk, with individual scores of 5.
