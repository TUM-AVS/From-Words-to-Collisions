### Safety analysis for timestep 4.7s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

**Assumptions and Clarifications:**

* Since the provided scenario lacks ego vehicle dimensions and adjusted distances (adjusted_d_long, adjusted_d_lat) which were specifically requested in the prompt, I am forced to perform the analysis using the provided *real distances* (DTClong, DTClat). This significantly reduces the accuracy of the risk assessment.  **The analysis below is based on raw distances and may not reflect true collision risk.**  A proper analysis requires the adjusted distances.
* I will assume a generic vehicle size to roughly estimate TTC and MDC when absolutely necessary, but this is a flawed substitute for proper adjusted distances.  I will highlight where this assumption impacts the analysis.
* Lateral movement is assumed negligible unless explicitly stated otherwise, given many lateral relative velocities are 0.
* I am prioritizing the explicit instructions regarding analysis format and JSON structure over a theoretically perfect collision analysis, which is impossible with the missing data.


### Obstacle Analysis:

* **Obstacle ID: 20020**
    - Distance Risk reason:  Far away (12.16m longitudinal, 12.16m lateral) and front-right.
    - Distance safety score: 5
    - Time Risk reason:  TTC > 5s (assuming constant velocity and no ego action, it would take approximately 3+ seconds to close the longitudinal distance).
    - Time safety score: 5
    - Overall Risk score: 5

* **Obstacle ID: 20023**
    - Distance Risk reason:  Far away and front-right (similar to 20020).
    - Distance safety score: 5
    - Time Risk reason: TTC > 5s
    - Time safety score: 5
    - Overall Risk score: 5

* **Obstacle ID: 20025**
    - Distance Risk reason: Far away and front-right (similar to 20020 and 20023).
    - Distance safety score: 5
    - Time Risk reason: TTC > 5s
    - Time safety score: 5
    - Overall Risk score: 5

* **Obstacle ID: 20027**
    - Distance Risk reason: Far away and front-right.
    - Distance safety score: 5
    - Time Risk reason: TTC > 5s
    - Time safety score: 5
    - Overall Risk score: 5

* **Obstacle ID: 20057**
    - Distance Risk reason:  VERY close behind (-0.76m longitudinal, -0.76m lateral). **HIGH RISK**. Without adjusted distances and vehicle dimensions, it's impossible to say with certainty if a collision is occurring, but it's highly likely given the small raw distance.
    - Distance safety score: 1
    - Time Risk reason: TTC < 0.5s (likely already colliding given raw distance and closing velocity)
    - Time safety score: 1 
    - Overall Risk score: 1

* **Obstacle ID: 20060**
    - Distance Risk reason: Moderately far behind and to the left.
    - Distance safety score: 5
    - Time Risk reason: Moving away longitudinally, TTC > 5s.
    - Time safety score: 5
    - Overall Risk score: 5

* **Obstacle ID: 20061**
    - Distance Risk reason: Far behind.
    - Distance safety score: 5
    - Time Risk reason:  Moving towards ego but very far, TTC > 5s.
    - Time safety score: 5
    - Overall Risk score: 5

* **Obstacle ID: 20072**
    - Distance Risk reason: Moderately close behind and to the left.
    - Distance safety score: 4
    - Time Risk reason: Moving away longitudinally, TTC > 5s.
