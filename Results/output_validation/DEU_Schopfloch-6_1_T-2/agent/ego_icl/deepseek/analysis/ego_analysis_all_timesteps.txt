Let me analyze the obstacles at the most recent timestep (4.7 seconds) and assess collision risks:

1. Obstacle 20020 (Front-right):
   - Longitudinal distance: 12.16m (closing at 3.70 m/s)
   - Lateral distance: -2.05m (stable)
   - TTC: 12.16/3.70 = 3.29s (Medium Risk)
   - MDC: 2.05m (Medium Risk)
   - Overall: Medium Risk (3)

2. Obstacle 20023 (Front-right):
   - Longitudinal distance: 12.02m (closing at 3.70 m/s)
   - Lateral distance: -9.28m (stable)
   - TTC: 12.02/3.70 = 3.25s (Medium Risk)
   - MDC: 9.28m (No Risk)
   - Overall: Medium Risk (3)

3. Obstacle 20025 (Front-right):
   - Longitudinal distance: 11.67m (closing at 3.70 m/s)
   - Lateral distance: -16.28m (stable)
   - TTC: 11.67/3.70 = 3.15s (Medium Risk)
   - MDC: 16.28m (No Risk)
   - Overall: Medium Risk (3)

4. Obstacle 20027 (Front-right):
   - Longitudinal distance: 11.47m (closing at 3.70 m/s)
   - Lateral distance: -23.25m (stable)
   - TTC: 11.47/3.70 = 3.10s (Medium Risk)
   - MDC: 23.25m (No Risk)
   - Overall: Medium Risk (3)

5. Obstacle 20057 (Behind):
   - Longitudinal distance: -0.76m (approaching at 3.10 m/s)
   - Lateral distance: 0.00m (exact alignment)
   - TTC: 0.76/3.10 = 0.25s (Extreme Risk)
   - MDC: 0.00m (Collision Risk)
   - Overall: Collision Risk (0)

6. Obstacle 20060 (Rear-left):
   - Longitudinal distance: -12.45m (moving away)
   - Lateral distance: 1.40m (stable)
   - TTC: N/A (diverging)
   - MDC: 1.40m (Medium Risk)
   - Overall: Medium Risk (3)

7. Obstacle 20061 (Behind):
   - Longitudinal distance: -20.88m (approaching at 1.73 m/s)
   - Lateral distance: 0.00m (exact alignment)
   - TTC: 20.88/1.73 = 12.07s (No Risk)
   - MDC: >5m (No Risk)
   - Overall: No Risk (5)

8. Obstacle 20072 (Rear-left):
   - Longitudinal distance: -5.49m (moving away)
   - Lateral distance: 1.73m (stable)
   - TTC: N/A (diverging)
   - MDC: 1.73m (Medium Risk)
   - Overall: Medium Risk (3)

9. Obstacle 20074 (Front-left):
   - Longitudinal distance: 10.55m (closing at 3.71 m/s)
   - Lateral distance: 6.76m (closing at 0.05 m/s)
   - TTC (long): 10.55/3.71 = 2.84s (Medium Risk)
   - TTC (lat): 6.76/0.05 = 135.2s (No Risk)
   - MDC: 6.76m (No Risk)
   - Overall: Medium Risk (3)

10. Obstacle 20077 (Rear-right):
    - Longitudinal distance: -16.43m (moving away)
    - Lateral distance: -4.42m (stable)
    - TTC: N/A (diverging)
    - MDC: 4.42m (Low Risk)
    - Overall: Low Risk (4)

11. Obstacle 20080 (Rear-right):
    - Longitudinal distance: -17.50m (moving away)
    - Lateral distance: -11.35m (stable)
    - TTC: N/A (diverging)
    - MDC: 11.35m (No Risk)
    - Overall: No Risk (5)

Key Findings:
- Obstacle 20057 is at Extreme Risk (approaching from behind with TTC 0.25s and exact lateral alignment)
- Based on trajectory analysis, Obstacle 20057 will likely collide with the ego vehicle in the next timestep
- No current collision is occurring (distance not exactly 0 yet)
- All other obstacles pose Medium or lower risk
