Obstacle 20020: Front-right, moving towards ego longitudinally. Lateral distance is small and slightly decreasing but not significantly. Longitudinal distance decreasing steadily.  TTC_long = 12.16m / 3.70m/s = 3.29s (Medium Risk). MDC is primarily based on the lateral distance, approximately >5m, thus Low risk. Overall risk: Medium (3).

Obstacle 20023: Front-right, moving towards ego longitudinally.  Longitudinal distance decreasing. TTC_long = 12.02m / 3.70m/s = 3.25s (Medium Risk).  Lateral distance is larger than 20020 and is not a primary concern. Overall risk: Medium (3).

Obstacle 20025: Front-right, moving towards ego longitudinally. Longitudinal distance decreasing. TTC_long = 11.67m / 3.70m/s = 3.15s (Medium Risk). Lateral distance is even larger than 20023, posing even less lateral risk. Overall risk: Medium (3)

Obstacle 20027: Front-right, moving towards ego longitudinally. Longitudinal distance decreasing. TTC_long = 11.47m / 3.70m/s = 3.10s (Medium Risk). Lateral distance is the largest among the front obstacles. Overall risk: Medium (3).

Obstacle 20057: Behind, moving towards ego longitudinally and laterally aligned. Longitudinal distance is very small and rapidly decreasing. TTC_long = 0.76m / 3.10m/s = 0.25s (Extreme Risk). MDC is approximately zero. Overall risk: Extreme (1).

Obstacle 20060: Rear-left, moving away longitudinally. No lateral relative motion. Longitudinal distance increasing. TTC not applicable in longitudinal direction. Lateral distance safe and slightly changing, representing a negligible lateral risk. Overall risk: Negligible (5).

Obstacle 20061: Behind, moving towards ego longitudinally. Laterally aligned and not a concern since longitudinal distance is much larger than 20057. Longitudinal distance decreasing slowly. TTC = 20.88m / 1.73 m/s = 12.07s (Negligible Risk). Overall risk: Negligible (5).

Obstacle 20072: Rear-left, moving away from ego longitudinally.  Longitudinal distance increasing. TTC not applicable in longitudinal direction. Lateral distance is safe and increasing, thus no concern. Overall risk: Negligible (5).

Obstacle 20074: Front-left, moving towards ego longitudinally. Longitudinal distance decreasing. TTC_long = 10.55m / 3.71m/s = 2.84s (Medium Risk).  Lateral distance is safe. Overall risk: Medium (3).

Obstacle 20077: Rear-right, moving away longitudinally. Longitudinal distance increasing. TTC not applicable in longitudinal direction. Lateral distance safe and not rapidly changing. Overall risk: Negligible (5).

Obstacle 20080: Rear-right, moving away longitudinally. Longitudinal distance increasing. TTC not applicable in longitudinal direction. Lateral distance safe and not rapidly changing. Overall risk: Negligible (5).
