### Obstacle-by-Obstacle Analysis:

#### Obstacle 20020:
- **Position & Trajectory**: Located in the Front-right of the ego car. Distances are decreasing both longitudinally (from 13.01 to 12.16m) and slightly adjusting laterally (-1.96 to -2.05m).
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal velocity is -3.70 m/s, indicating the obstacle is moving away.
- **TTC Calculation**: 
  - Longitudinal TTC = 12.16m / 3.70m/s ≈ 3.29s
- **MDC**: Since there’s no lateral relative motion and the obstacle is in front-right, focus primarily on longitudinal distance.
- **Risk Assessment**: Medium Risk (TTC < 3.0s).

#### Obstacle 20023:
- **Position & Trajectory**: Front-right of the ego car, with stable longitudinal distance changes (12.91 to 12.02m) and lateral movement stays minimal (-9.14 to -9.28m).
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal velocity is -3.70 m/s.
- **TTC Calculation**: 
  - Longitudinal TTC = 12.02m / 3.70m/s ≈ 3.25s 
- **MDC**: Focus primarily on longitudinal distance due to positioning.
- **Risk Assessment**: Medium Risk (TTC < 3.0s).

#### Obstacle 20025:
- **Position & Trajectory**: In the Front-right, contraction from 12.62m to 11.67m longitudinally, no lateral adjustments.
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal velocity is -3.70 m/s.
- **TTC Calculation**: 
  - Longitudinal TTC = 11.67m / 3.70m/s ≈ 3.15s
- **MDC**: Predominantly based on longitudinal as it is positioned to the front-right.
- **Risk Assessment**: Medium Risk (TTC < 3.0s).

#### Obstacle 20057:
- **Position & Trajectory**: Positioned Behind with longitudinal distance -0.76m and closing in. 
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal velocity is 3.10m/s, approaching fast.
- **TTC Calculation**: 
  - Here, consider absolute convergence direction 
  - The rapid distance closure and aligning path present an immediate threat.
- **MDC**: Critical in alignment, a slight longitudinal alignment with close proximity.
- **Risk Assessment**: Collision Imminent (Observed <1m distances & high velocity).

#### Obstacle 20060:
- **Position & Trajectory**: Rear-left with separation trends (longitudinal from -11.67 to -12.45m).
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal velocity at -3.70 m/s.
- **TTC Calculation**: N/A — moving away longitudinally.
- **MDC**: Safe margins at both dimensions.
- **Risk Assessment**: Negligible Risk (Diverging).

#### Obstacle 20061:
- **Position & Trajectory**: Positioned Behind, with distances showing closing pattern.
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal at 1.73 m/s.
- **TTC Calculation**: 
  - Consider potential alignment 
  - Safe due to protracted separation.
- **MDC**: Longitudinally aligned yet non-critical.
- **Risk Assessment**: Low Risk (Longitudinal Alignment, minor convergence rate).

#### Obstacle 20072:
- **Position & Trajectory**: Rear-left, diverging.
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal direction at -3.86 m/s.
- **TTC Calculation**: N/A — moving away longitudinally/laterally aligned movements.
- **Risk Assessment**: Negligible Risk (Diverging).

#### Obstacle 20074:
- **Position & Trajectory**: Front-left with decreasing longitudinal proximity.
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal direction at -3.71 m/s.
- **TTC Calculation**: 
  - Longitudinal TTC = 10.55m / 3.71m/s ≈ 2.84s
- **MDC**: Given trajectory, isn't close proximity imminent.
- **Risk Assessment**: Medium Risk (Longitudinal convergence observed).
