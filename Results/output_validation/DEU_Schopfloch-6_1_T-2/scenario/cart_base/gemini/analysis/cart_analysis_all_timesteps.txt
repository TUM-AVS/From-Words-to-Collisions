Obstacle 20057 is in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle and is rapidly approaching from behind.  While not an immediate collision at the last timestep (4.9s), the closing velocity is high and the obstacle's position (-0.5379, -1.9712 at 4.5s) combined with its speed suggests a very high probability of collision in the immediate future. Given the ego vehicle's deceleration, a collision is likely within the next second or two. This situation represents an extreme risk.
