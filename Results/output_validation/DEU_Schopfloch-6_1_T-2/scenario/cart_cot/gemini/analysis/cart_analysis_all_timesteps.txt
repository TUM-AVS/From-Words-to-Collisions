- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Stationary obstacle poses no immediate time-related risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5
- Obstacle ID: 20025.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is far from the ego vehicle and stationary. No risk observed over the past 10 timesteps.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Stationary obstacle poses no immediate time-related risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5
- Obstacle ID: 20027.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is far from the ego vehicle and stationary. No risk observed over the past 10 timesteps.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Stationary obstacle poses no immediate time-related risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5
- Obstacle ID: 20057.0
- Distance Risk reason:  While in the same lanelet, obstacle 20057.0 started relatively close and is rapidly approaching the ego vehicle from behind over the past 10 timesteps. The relative positions and ego vehicle's deceleration increase the risk.
- Distance safety score: 2
- Time Risk reason: The obstacle's higher velocity and positive acceleration, compared to the ego vehicle's decelerating motion, indicate a high risk of collision in the near future.
- Time safety score: 2
- Overall Risk score: 2
- Obstacle ID: 20060.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is far from the ego vehicle and almost stationary. No risk observed throughout the provided timesteps.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Obstacle is almost stationary, posing no time-related risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5
- Obstacle ID: 20061.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is far from the ego vehicle. No risk observed in the given timesteps.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason:  Although the obstacle is moving, it is in a different lanelet and poses no immediate time-related risk to the ego vehicle.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5
- Obstacle ID: 20072.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is relatively close to the ego vehicle but their paths are diverging as the ego vehicle's trajectory doesn't intersect the obstacle's location.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: The obstacle is slowing down significantly and is not on a direct collision course, hence reducing the time-related risk.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4
- Obstacle ID: 20074.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is far from the ego vehicle and poses no distance-based risk.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason:  The obstacle is moving slowly and not towards the ego vehicle, hence no immediate time-related risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5
- Obstacle ID: 20077.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is far from the ego vehicle and stationary.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Stationary obstacle poses no immediate time-related risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5
- Obstacle ID: 20080.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is far from the ego vehicle and stationary.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Stationary obstacle poses no immediate time-related risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5


### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. **Most critical obstacle:** Obstacle 20057.0 is the most critical as it is in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle, approaching rapidly from behind.

2. **Trajectory Analysis:** Over the 10 timesteps, obstacle 20057.0 consistently moves towards the ego vehicle with increasing velocity while the ego vehicle decelerates. This converging trajectory and the velocity difference significantly increase the risk of a rear-end collision.

3. **Relative Position, Velocity, and Acceleration:** Obstacle 20057.0's position progressively closes in on the ego vehicle. Its velocity is consistently higher than the ego vehicle's and it is also accelerating, exacerbating the risk. The ego vehicle's deceleration worsens the situation.

4. **Collision Determination:** While a collision hasn't happened yet within the provided 10 timesteps, the trends strongly suggest a high probability of an imminent rear-end collision if the current trajectories and dynamics continue.

5. **Reasoning:** The continuous decrease in distance, the substantial difference in velocity, the opposing accelerations (ego decelerating, obstacle accelerating), and their shared lanelet point towards a very high likelihood of a collision in the very near future.
