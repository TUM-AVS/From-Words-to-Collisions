### Safety Analysis for the Most Recent Timestep (4.9 seconds):

### Obstacle Analysis:
1. **Obstacle ID: 20057**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Currently at (0.7686, 1.1262), moving towards ego's position (2.4423, 5.0943) with high velocity (6.9262 m/s). Over the last 9 timesteps, it has been consistently approaching the ego vehicle's path in lanelet 292.0.
   - **Distance safety score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: Relative velocity is high (6.9262 m/s vs ego's 3.3527 m/s), and distance is closing rapidly. TTC is critically low.
   - **Time safety score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)

2. **Obstacle ID: 20061**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: At (-7.3325, -17.7656), moving towards ego's general direction but still at a significant distance. Over time, it has been moving towards the ego but not directly in its path.
   - **Distance safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: Velocity (5.6411 m/s) is higher than ego's, but lateral distance is large.
   - **Time safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 3 (Medium Risk)

3. **Obstacle ID: 20072**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Stationary at (-4.9377, -3.3977), in lanelet 291.0 (adjacent to ego's lanelet 292.0). Over time, it has remained stationary.
   - **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: No movement, so no immediate time risk.
   - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low Risk)

4. **Obstacle ID: 20083**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: At (10.8894, -29.6636), moving away from ego's path. Over time, it has been moving laterally away.
   - **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: Moving away with velocity (3.0617 m/s).
   - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)

5. **Other Obstacles (20020, 20023, 20025, etc.)**:
   - All are either stationary or moving away from the ego's path. Their distances are large, and their trajectories do not intersect with the ego's immediate path.
   - **Overall Risk score**: 5 (Negligible Risk) for all.

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. **Ego Vehicle**: Moving at 3.3527 m/s, decelerating (-1.2019 m/s²), in lanelet 292.0.
2. **Obstacle 20057**: Moving at 6.9262 m/s towards the ego's path in the same lanelet. Over the last 9 timesteps, it has been closing the distance rapidly.
3. **TTC Calculation**: Distance ~1.5m, relative velocity ~3.5735 m/s → TTC ~0.42s (critical).
4. **Collision Risk**: High due to low TTC and same lanelet.
5. **Other Obstacles**: No immediate collision risk due to distance or divergent paths.
