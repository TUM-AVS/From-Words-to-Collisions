### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
No collision is imminent in this scenario.  Obstacle 20057 poses a high risk due to its high closing velocity from behind the ego vehicle, requiring monitoring and potentially evasive maneuvers in the near future. No other obstacles are on a direct collision course.

### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
  "CollisionObstacles": [],
  "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null,
  "ScenarioAnalysis": {
    "IsCollisionScenario": false,
    "Reasoning": "No obstacle has a risk score of 0, indicating no immediate collision. Obstacle 20057 poses a high risk (score 2) due to its rapid approach from behind."
  }
}
```
