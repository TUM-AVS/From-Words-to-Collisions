### Safety analysis for timestep 4.1s through 4.8s:

Similar analysis applies for these timesteps with the following key observations:

* **Obstacle 20057 (rear):** This obstacle continues to approach from behind and poses an increasing risk as its longitudinal distance decreases significantly over each timestep. TTC also decreases steadily.  

* **Obstacle 20072 (rear-left):** While initially moving away longitudinally, this obstacle gets progressively closer to the ego vehicle, representing an increasing risk.

* **Front Obstacles (20020, 20023, 20025, 20074):** These maintain similar TTC and MDC values, decreasing slowly, requiring monitoring but not presenting immediate high risk due to sufficient lateral and longitudinal distance.


### Safety analysis for timestep 4.9s:

* **Obstacle 20057:** Collision occurs at this timestep.
