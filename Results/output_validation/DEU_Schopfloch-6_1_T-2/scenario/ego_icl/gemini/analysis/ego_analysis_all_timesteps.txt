* **Obstacle 20020:** Front-right, approaching longitudinally. Lateral distance is stable around -2m. Longitudinal distance decreasing steadily.  TTC_long = 11.39m / 3.35 m/s = 3.4s (Medium Risk). MDC is primarily lateral (-2.01m), so Medium risk (3). Overall risk: **Medium (3)**.

* **Obstacle 20023:** Front-right, approaching longitudinally.  Lateral distance stable around -9m. Longitudinal distance decreasing steadily. TTC_long = 11.24m / 3.35 m/s = 3.35s (Medium Risk). MDC is primarily lateral (-9.34m), so No risk (5). Overall risk: **Medium (3)**.

* **Obstacle 20025:** Front-right, approaching longitudinally. Lateral distance stable around -16m. Longitudinal distance decreasing steadily. TTC_long = 10.86m / 3.35 m/s = 3.24s (Medium Risk). MDC is primarily lateral (-16.33m), so No risk (5). Overall risk: **Medium (3)**.

* **Obstacle 20027:** Front-right, approaching longitudinally. Lateral distance stable around -23m. Longitudinal distance decreasing steadily. TTC_long = 10.64m / 3.35 m/s = 3.18s (Medium Risk). MDC is primarily lateral (-23.30), so No risk (5). Overall risk: **Medium (3)**

* **Obstacle 20057:** Behind, approaching longitudinally and laterally aligned with the ego vehicle. The longitudinal distance has been consistently decreasing across all timesteps, reaching 0.00m in the last timestep.  This, combined with the positive relative longitudinal velocity (3.57 m/s) and the "Collision" label, confirms a collision. TTC_long = 0.00m / 3.57m/s = 0s. MDC = 0m. Overall Risk: **Collision (0)**.

* **Obstacle 20060:** Rear-left, receding longitudinally, approaching laterally.  Longitudinal distance increasing. Lateral distance is small (1.46m) and slightly increasing which means the vehicle may be in an adjacent lane behind, but moving away. TTC_lat is not applicable (very low lateral velocity).  MDC is primarily lateral and > 1m. Overall risk: **No Risk (5)**.

* **Obstacle 20061:** Behind, approaching longitudinally. Lateral distance is 0.00, indicating it is directly behind the ego vehicle in the same lane, but not very close (-20m). Longitudinal distance decreasing slowly. TTC_long = 20.35m / 2.29 m/s = 8.89s (No Risk). MDC is primarily lateral (0m), but not a risk as the vehicle is behind. Overall risk: **No Risk (5)**.

* **Obstacle 20072:** Rear-left, receding longitudinally, approaching laterally. Longitudinal distance increasing. Lateral distance is small (1.77m) and slightly increasing. This obstacle is moving away from the ego vehicle. Overall risk: **No Risk (5)**

* **Obstacle 20074:** Front-left, approaching longitudinally. Lateral distance stable around 6.7m. Longitudinal distance decreasing steadily. TTC_long = 9.84m / 3.36 m/s = 2.93s (Medium Risk). MDC is primarily lateral (6.71m), so No Risk(5). Overall risk: **Medium (3)**.

* **Obstacle 20077:** Rear-right, receding longitudinally. Lateral distance stable around -4m.  This obstacle is moving away from the ego vehicle. Overall risk: **No Risk (5)**.

* **Obstacle 20080:** Rear-right, receding longitudinally. Lateral distance stable around -11m. This obstacle is moving away from the ego vehicle. Overall risk: **No Risk (5)**.
