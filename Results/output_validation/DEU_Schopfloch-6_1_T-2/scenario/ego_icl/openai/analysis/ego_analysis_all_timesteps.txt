### Obstacle-by-Obstacle Analysis

**Obstacle 20057**  
- **Trajectory Analysis**:  
  At 4.9 seconds, obstacle 20057 is explicitly mentioned as being in a "Collision" state with the ego vehicle.  
  - Longitudinal Distance (adjusted): 0.00 m  
  - Lateral Distance (adjusted): 0.00 m  
  - Relative Velocity: Longitudinal 3.57 m/s, Lateral 0.08 m/s  
  - Acceleration: Longitudinal 0.94 m/s², Lateral 2.20 m/s²  
- **TTC and MDC Calculations**:
  - Since both longitudinal and lateral distances are zero, the obstacle is at collision with the ego vehicle.
  - The latency in changes across timesteps showed a consistent closing at the rear, confirming an imminent collision.
- **Risk Assessment**:
  - Risk Score: 0 (Collision)

**Obstacle 20061**  
- **Trajectory Analysis**:  
  Positioned behind the ego vehicle with longitudinal closing velocities.  
  - Longitudinal Distance (adjusted): -20.35 m  
  - Relative Velocity: Longitudinal 2.29 m/s  
- **TTC and MDC Calculations**:
  - TTC (longitudinal) = 20.35 m / 2.29 m/s ≈ 8.88 seconds
  - As the TTC is greater than 5.0 seconds and lateral alignment is not critical here, no immediate collision risk is expected.
- **Risk Assessment**:
  - Risk Score: 4 (Low Risk)

**Obstacle 20020**  
- **Trajectory Analysis**:  
  Located front-right of the ego vehicle, steadily decreasing longitudinal distance and is headed toward the ego vehicle.  
  - Longitudinal Distance (adjusted): 11.39 m  
  - Lateral Distance (adjusted): -2.01 m  
  - Relative Velocity: Longitudinal -3.35 m/s  
- **TTC and MDC Calculations**:
  - TTC (longitudinal): 11.39 m / 3.35 m/s ≈ 3.40 seconds
  - Stable lateral path maintaining distance around 2 meters.
- **Risk Assessment**:
  - Risk Score: 3 (Medium Risk)

**Obstacle 20060**  
- **Trajectory Analysis**:  
  Position behind (rear-left) and moving away longitudinally, approaching laterally.  
  - Longitudinal Distance (adjusted): -13.18 m  
  - Lateral Distance (approach unnoted and minor)
- **TTC and MDC Calculations**:
  - No immediate TTC due to opposite longitudinal motion.
  - Maintains significant distancing with inconsequential lateral change.
- **Risk Assessment**:
  - Risk Score: 5 (No Risk)

**Conclusion:**

This is a collision scenario because obstacle 20057 is in a state of collision with the ego vehicle. The overlapping states that place obstacle 20057 in both longitudinal and lateral alignment at 0.00 m confirms the collision status.
