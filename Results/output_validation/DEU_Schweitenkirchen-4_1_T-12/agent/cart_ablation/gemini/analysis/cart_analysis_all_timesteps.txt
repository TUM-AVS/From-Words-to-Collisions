Here's the collision risk analysis:

**Obstacle 221:** This obstacle is in a different lane (179) than the ego vehicle (178), and maintains a safe lateral distance.  The longitudinal distance is also substantial and increasing. Therefore, it poses negligible risk.

**Obstacle 386:** This obstacle is in lane 177, adjacent to the ego vehicle's lane (178).  While it's moving slightly faster than the ego vehicle, it maintains a safe lateral distance and its longitudinal position poses no immediate threat.  It represents a low risk.

**Obstacle 426:** This obstacle is in the same lane as the ego vehicle (178).  Initially, it is somewhat close behind the ego vehicle, raising a medium risk. However, the subsequent data shows that the distance between the vehicles is increasing, reducing the risk level from medium to low.

**Obstacle 431:** This obstacle is in lane 177, adjacent to the ego vehicle's lane.  It's moving at a similar speed as the ego vehicle and maintains a safe lateral and longitudinal distance.  It poses a low risk.

Because the provided context encompasses a limited time window, a definitive assessment of predicted extreme risk is challenging.  However, based on the current trajectories and behaviors, none of the obstacles are exhibiting behavior that suggests an imminent extreme risk.
