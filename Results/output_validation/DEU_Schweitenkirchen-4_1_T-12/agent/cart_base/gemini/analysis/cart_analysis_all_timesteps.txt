Obstacle 221.0 (Lanelet 179): This obstacle is in a different lane and maintains a safe lateral distance from the ego vehicle throughout the provided timesteps.  It poses no collision risk. Risk score: 5

Obstacle 386.0 (Lanelet 177): This obstacle is in the adjacent lane (177) and moving slightly faster than the ego vehicle. Although it's in a different lane, the lateral distance is decreasing slightly over the timesteps. However, there is no immediate risk of collision. Risk score: 4


Obstacle 426.0 (Lanelet 178): This obstacle is in the same lane as the ego vehicle (178) and initially ahead. The ego vehicle is decelerating more rapidly than Obstacle 426.0, increasing the risk of a rear-end collision. The distance between them is decreasing over the timesteps. This warrants close monitoring and requires prompt action from the ego vehicle to avoid collision. Risk score: 2

Obstacle 431.0 (Lanelet 177): This obstacle is in the adjacent lane (177). The ego vehicle's trajectory and the obstacle's trajectory maintain a safe lateral distance. There's no immediate danger of collision. Risk score: 4.
