Obstacle 426 is showing the highest risk. It's in the same lane as the ego vehicle and, despite a slight deceleration, its future trajectory suggests a possible collision if both vehicles maintain their current course and speed.  Calculating TTC based on the latest positions and velocities supports this concern. Other obstacles are at a safe distance or in different lanes, posing lower risks.
