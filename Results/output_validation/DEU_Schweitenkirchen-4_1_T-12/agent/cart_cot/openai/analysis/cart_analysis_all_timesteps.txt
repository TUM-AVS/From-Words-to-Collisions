### Analysis

To evaluate the collision risk for the scenario described, especially focusing on the most recent timestep at 5.2 seconds, we consider the following parameters for each obstacle relative to the ego vehicle (ID 409.0):

#### At 5.2 seconds:
- **Ego Vehicle (ID 409.0):** 
  - Position: (-363.24, 861.4384)
  - Velocity: 11.7209 m/s
  - Lanelet: 178.0

1. **Obstacle 221.0:**
   - Position: (-366.4473, 861.5663)
   - Velocity: 24.875 m/s
   - Lanelet: 179.0
   - Relative to ego: The position is quite close, but the obstacle is in a different lanelet with faster speed, reducing immediate direct collision risk but indicating potential future risk.
   
2. **Obstacle 386.0:**
   - Position: (-355.6129, 838.489)
   - Velocity: 25.8488 m/s
   - Lanelet: 177.0
   - Relative to ego: Significant distance away, traveling in a parallel lane, low immediate risk.

3. **Obstacle 426.0:**
   - Position: (-364.1, 868.033)
   - Velocity: 25.4965 m/s
   - Lanelet: 178.0
   - Relative to ego: Partially critical as this occupies the same lanelet and has higher speed. This could lead to a high risk but not imminent unless the trajectory overlaps shortly.
   
4. **Obstacle 431.0:**
   - Position: (-360.8298, 869.7483)
   - Velocity: 25.3709 m/s
   - Lanelet: 177.0
   - Relative to ego: This is in a corridor close and traveling at a high speed. Its path could represent future significant risk if lanes merge or in the advent of unforeseen maneuvers.

Given the detailed analysis, Obstacle 426.0 poses a notably high risk due to its presence in the same lanelet moving faster, requiring urgent attention to prevent future collision. Currently, none of the obstacles convincingly suggest the highest risk (scores 0 or 1) for collision at the next instant, given current trajectories and velocities.
