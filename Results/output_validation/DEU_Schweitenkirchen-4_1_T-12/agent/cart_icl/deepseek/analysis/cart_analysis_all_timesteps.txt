### Analysis:

1. **Obstacle 221.0**:  
   - **Position**: (-366.4473, 861.5663) at 5.2s  
   - **Relative Motion**: Moving towards ego vehicle with a velocity of 24.875 m/s (higher than ego's 11.7209 m/s).  
   - **TTC**: The longitudinal distance is decreasing rapidly, and the lateral distance is minimal (same lanelet 179.0 adjacent to ego's lanelet 178.0).  
   - **Risk**: **Extreme Risk (1)** due to high relative velocity and proximity.

2. **Obstacle 426.0**:  
   - **Position**: (-364.1, 868.033) at 5.2s  
   - **Relative Motion**: Moving in the same lanelet (178.0) as ego but with a higher velocity (25.4965 m/s vs. ego's 11.7209 m/s).  
   - **TTC**: The distance is closing, but not as rapidly as Obstacle 221.0.  
   - **Risk**: **High Risk (2)** due to same lanelet and closing distance.

3. **Obstacle 431.0**:  
   - **Position**: (-360.8298, 869.7483) at 5.2s  
   - **Relative Motion**: Moving in lanelet 177.0 (adjacent to ego's lanelet 178.0) with a velocity of 25.3709 m/s.  
   - **TTC**: The lateral distance is significant, and the relative velocity is not directly towards ego.  
   - **Risk**: **Medium Risk (3)** due to adjacent lane and manageable distance.

4. **Obstacle 386.0**:  
   - **Position**: (-355.6129, 838.489) at 5.2s  
   - **Relative Motion**: Moving away from ego in lanelet 177.0 with a velocity of 25.8488 m/s.  
   - **TTC**: The distance is increasing.  
   - **Risk**: **Low Risk (4)** due to increasing distance and no immediate danger.
