Here's the analysis of the scenario focusing on the most recent timestep (5.2 seconds) and considering the trends from previous timesteps:

**Obstacle 221:** This obstacle is in a different lanelet (179) than the ego vehicle (178). While it is getting closer longitudinally, the lateral separation suggests no immediate collision risk. Risk: **Low (4)**.

**Obstacle 386:** This obstacle is in lanelet 177, while the ego vehicle is in lanelet 178. The lateral separation suggests no immediate collision risk. Risk: **Low (4)**

**Obstacle 426:** This obstacle is in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle (178) and is ahead.  The ego vehicle is decelerating more aggressively than obstacle 426, so the risk of collision is increasing. A collision is not imminent in the next few seconds, but the trend should be closely monitored. Risk: **Medium (3)**

**Obstacle 431:** This obstacle is in lanelet 177, while the ego vehicle is in 178. The lateral distance is significant, and there are no signs of converging trajectories. Risk: **Low (4)**.
