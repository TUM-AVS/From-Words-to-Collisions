To accurately assess the scenario at the most recent timestep (5.2 seconds), we need to calculate the relative positions, velocities, and potential collision risks between the ego vehicle and each obstacle. Here are the key points for each obstacle:

### Step-by-step Analysis:

1. **Ego Vehicle:**
   - Position: (-363.24, 861.4384)
   - Velocity: 11.7209 m/s
   - Lanelet: 178.0

2. **Obstacle 221.0:**
   - Position: (-366.4473, 861.5663)
   - Velocity: 24.875 m/s
   - Lanelet: 179.0
   - Relative Position: Laterally close but in a different lanelet.
   - Relative Velocity: Faster than Ego.
   - Despite being faster, it is in a different lanelet, indicating a negligible risk due to spatial separation.

3. **Obstacle 386.0:**
   - Position: (-355.6129, 838.489)
   - Velocity: 25.8488 m/s
   - Lanelet: 177.0
   - Relative Position: Some distance longitudinally ahead of the ego but in a different lanelet indicating a low risk.
   - Risk remains negligible due to separation in lanelets.

4. **Obstacle 426.0:**
   - Position: (-364.1, 868.033)
   - Velocity: 25.4965 m/s
   - Lanelet: 178.0
   - Relative Position: Both laterally and longitudinally closer, the same lanelet.
   - Risk analysis: Due to increased closing speed, it has a **Medium Risk (3)**.
   
5. **Obstacle 431.0:**
   - Position: (-360.8298, 869.7483)
   - Velocity: 25.3709 m/s
   - Lanelet: 177.0
   - Relative Position: Faster and ahead, but different lanelet.
   - Again, presents negligible risk due to lanelet differences.

### Conclusion:
Based on the calculated assessments, obstacle 426.0 poses the highest risk with a medium-risk level due to its proximity and shared lanelet with the ego vehicle. The others, despite their velocities, present no immediate danger due to lanelet separation.

### JSON Output:
```json
{
    "CollisionObstacles": [],
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {},
    "HighRiskObstacle": {},
    "MediumRiskObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "426.0",
        "OverallRiskScore": 3
    }
}
```

In this scenario, there are no extreme or collision risk vehicles, but obstacle 426.0 requires careful attention due to its proximity and speed in the same lane. The other obstacles are not seen as significant threats due to their positions and lanelets.
