At the most recent timestamp (5.2 seconds), the following analysis applies:

**Obstacle 221:** This obstacle is to the right of the ego vehicle, with a lateral distance of -1.53 meters. While it's not currently on a collision course, the proximity raises concern.  Given the lateral distance and the longitudinal velocity difference, assigning a Proximity score of 3, MDC of 3 and TTC score of 5. Overall risk is medium (3).

**Obstacle 386:** This obstacle is in the Front-left, moving away from the ego vehicle both longitudinally (19.37 m) and laterally (2.19 m).  It poses no immediate risk. Proximity: 5, MDC: 5, TTC: 5. Overall risk is negligible (5).

**Obstacle 426:** This obstacle is directly behind the ego vehicle (-2.14 m) and closing rapidly. The small longitudinal distance and high relative longitudinal velocity indicate a high risk of collision. Proximity: 1, MDC: 2, TTC: 1. Overall risk is high/extreme (2/1).

**Obstacle 431:** This obstacle is located Rear-left of the ego vehicle (-3.30 m longitudinally and 2.12 m laterally). The decreasing longitudinal distance combined with the relative velocities indicates a potential collision risk. Proximity: 2, MDC: 2, TTC: 2. Overall risk is high (2).
