At t=5.2 seconds, Obstacle 221 is right next to the ego vehicle longitudinally (0.00m) and slightly to the right (-1.53m laterally). Although moving away laterally, its high longitudinal velocity (13.15 m/s relative to ego) suggests it might have just overtaken the ego vehicle.  This situation requires attention but doesn't pose an immediate collision risk. Thus, it is classified as Medium Risk (3).

Obstacle 386 is far ahead and to the left of the ego vehicle, moving further away both longitudinally and laterally. It poses no risk. Negligible Risk (5).

Obstacle 426 is behind the ego vehicle (-2.14m longitudinally) and directly behind it laterally (0.00m). Its high longitudinal velocity towards the ego (13.78 m/s) and close proximity represents a very high risk of collision. This is classified as Extreme Risk (1).

Obstacle 431 is behind and to the left of the ego car, approaching quickly (13.65 m/s) and relatively close (-3.30m longitudinally and 2.12m laterally).  This also indicates a high risk of collision. High Risk (2).



Risk Levels:
0: Collision - Physical contact occurred or unavoidable
1: Extreme Risk - Immediate collision likely
2: High Risk - Close to collision, needs quick action
3: Medium Risk - Manageable with proper reaction
4: Low Risk - Minimal risk, sufficient time to react
5: Negligible Risk - No significant risk
