### Safety analysis for timestep 5.2s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

**Assumptions and Calculations:**

Since the provided context lacks vehicle dimensions, I'm assuming a standard car length of 4 meters and width of 2 meters for both ego and obstacle vehicles.  I'll adjust the longitudinal and lateral distances to account for vehicle size. Additionally, since acceleration data is provided, a more accurate TTC can be calculated using the following formula:

TTC = (-Vrel ± sqrt(Vrel² - 2 * Arel * D)) / Arel

Where:
* Vrel is the relative velocity
* Arel is the relative acceleration
* D is the adjusted distance


### Obstacle Analysis:

**- Obstacle ID: 221**
- Distance Risk reason: At 5.2 seconds, Obstacle 221 has a real distance of 0m longitudinal and 0m lateral, indicating a collision. The adjusted distances would also be very close to zero or even negative, confirming a likely collision.
- Distance safety score: 0
- Time Risk reason: Given the near-zero distance and the relative velocity, TTC would effectively be zero.
- Time safety score: 0
- Overall Risk score: 0

**- Obstacle ID: 386**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 386 is located far ahead and to the left of the ego vehicle (19.37m longitudinal and 19.37m lateral). After adjusting for vehicle size, it would still maintain a very safe distance.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Large positive longitudinal and lateral distances, coupled with the relative velocity moving away from the ego vehicle imply an extremely long TTC. 
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

**- Obstacle ID: 426**
- Distance Risk reason: At 5.2 seconds, Obstacle 426 is behind the ego vehicle with -2.14m longitudinal and -2.14 lateral distance. The negative values indicate it's behind and slightly to the left/right depending on the coordinate system. This close proximity poses a significant risk, worsened by the closing relative velocity. Adjusted distances would be close to or within collision range.
- Distance safety score: 1
- Time Risk reason: The relative velocity is high and closing, resulting in a very short TTC, indicating extreme risk.
- Time safety score: 1
- Overall Risk score: 1

**- Obstacle ID: 431**
- Distance Risk reason: At 5.2 seconds, Obstacle 431 is -3.30m longitudinal and -3.30m lateral from the ego. This indicates a high risk of collision. The adjusted distances would further exacerbate this risk.
- Distance safety score: 2
- Time Risk reason:  The relative velocity shows that the obstacle is approaching rapidly. This, combined with the negative longitudinal distance means the TTC is very low, posing a high risk.
- Time safety score: 2
- Overall Risk score: 2
