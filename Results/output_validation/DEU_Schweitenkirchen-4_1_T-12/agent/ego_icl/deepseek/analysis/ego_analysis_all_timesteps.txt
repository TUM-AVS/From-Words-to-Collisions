### Obstacle-by-Obstacle Analysis (Most Recent Timestep: 5.2s)

---

#### **Obstacle 221 (Right of ego car)**
- **Adjusted Distance**: Longitudinal 0.00m (aligned), Lateral -1.53m  
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal 13.15 m/s (moving away), Lateral -0.06 m/s (moving away)  
- **Motion**: Exact longitudinal alignment. Obstacle is moving away laterally to the right.  
- **Trajectory Analysis**:  
  - Longitudinal: The obstacle has passed the ego vehicle (longitudinal distance = 0m) and is moving away at high speed (13.15 m/s). No collision risk.  
  - Lateral: The obstacle is moving away (-0.06 m/s) with a safe lateral distance (1.53m).  
- **TTC**: Not applicable (relative velocity is diverging).  
- **MDC**: 1.53m (lateral distance).  
- **Risk Assessment**:  
  - MDC = 1.53m → Medium Risk (3)  
  - TTC = N/A → No Risk (5)  
  - **Overall Risk**: **3 (Medium Risk)**

#### **Obstacle 386 (Front-left of ego car)**
- **Adjusted Distance**: Longitudinal 19.37m, Lateral 2.19m  
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal 14.13 m/s (moving away), Lateral 0.27 m/s (moving away)  
- **Motion**: Obstacle is moving away longitudinally and laterally to the left.  
- **Trajectory Analysis**:  
  - Both distances are increasing (safe divergence).  
- **TTC**: Not applicable (diverging paths).  
- **MDC**: Minimum of 19.37m (longitudinal) and 2.19m (lateral) → 2.19m.  
- **Risk Assessment**:  
  - MDC = 2.19m → Medium Risk (3)  
  - TTC = N/A → No Risk (5)  
  - **Overall Risk**: **3 (Medium Risk)**

#### **Obstacle 426 (Behind of ego car)**
- **Adjusted Distance**: Longitudinal -2.14m (behind), Lateral 0.00m (aligned)  
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal 13.78 m/s (approaching), Lateral -0.06 m/s (negligible)  
- **Motion**: Exact lateral alignment. Obstacle is driving toward the ego car from behind.  
- **Trajectory Analysis**:  
  - Longitudinal: Closing rapidly (13.78 m/s) but still 2.14m behind.  
  - Lateral: Perfect alignment (0.00m), but no lateral movement toward collision.  
- **TTC**: 2.14m / 13.78 m/s ≈ 0.155s (Extreme Risk).  
- **MDC**: 0.00m (lateral alignment), but longitudinal distance still 2.14m.  
- **Risk Assessment**:  
  - TTC = 0.155s → Extreme Risk (1)  
  - MDC = 2.14m → Medium Risk (3)  
  - **Overall Risk**: **1 (Extreme Risk)**

#### **Obstacle 431 (Rear-left of ego car)**
- **Adjusted Distance**: Longitudinal -3.30m (behind), Lateral 2.12m  
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal 13.65 m/s (approaching), Lateral -0.07 m/s (moving away)  
- **Motion**: Obstacle is driving toward the ego car from behind but moving away laterally.  
- **Trajectory Analysis**:  
  - Longitudinal: Closing rapidly (13.65 m/s), but lateral distance is increasing.  
- **TTC**: 3.30m / 13.65 m/s ≈ 0.242s (Extreme Risk).  
- **MDC**: 2.12m (lateral distance).  
- **Risk Assessment**:  
  - TTC = 0.242s → Extreme Risk (1)  
  - MDC = 2.12m → Medium Risk (3)  
  - **Overall Risk**: **1 (Extreme Risk)**

### Key Findings:
1. **Obstacle 426** is the highest-risk obstacle (Extreme Risk, score 1) due to rapid longitudinal closure (TTC = 0.155s) and exact lateral alignment.  
2. **Obstacle 431** also poses Extreme Risk (score 1) but is moving away laterally.  
3. **No active collision** (score 0) at the current timestep, but Obstacle 426 is predicted to collide if trajectories remain unchanged.  
4. Obstacles 221 and 386 are Medium Risk (score 3) with safe diverging paths.
