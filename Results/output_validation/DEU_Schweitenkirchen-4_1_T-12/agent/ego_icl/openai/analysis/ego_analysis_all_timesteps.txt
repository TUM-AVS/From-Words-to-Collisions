Let's perform a detailed analysis for the most recent timestep (at 5.2 seconds) by taking into consideration the motion description and trajectories from previous timesteps:

**Obstacle 221 - Right of ego vehicle**

- **Adjusted Longitudinal Distance**: 0.00 m
- **Adjusted Lateral Distance**: -1.53 m
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal 13.15 m/s (approaching), Lateral -0.06 m/s (slightly moving away)
- **Motion**: Exact longitudinal alignment, moving away laterally to the right

**Analysis**:
- **Longitudinal**: With an adjusted distance of 0.00 m and approaching velocity of 13.15 m/s, this indicates imminent overlap or collision alignment.
- **Lateral**: Since the vehicle is moving laterally away (-0.06 m/s), conflicts hinge largely on longitudinal interaction.
- **MDC**: At intersection on longitudinal alignment and increased proximity near 0.00 m, high risk of contact.
- **TTC**: With approximate zero longitudinal separation and fast closing, this approaches a collision scenario rapidly.

**Risk Assessment**: Significant risk of collision because of exact longitudinal alignment, moving into position. Risk Score: **1 (Extreme)**.

**Obstacle 386 - Front-left of ego vehicle**

- **Adjusted Longitudinal Distance**: 19.37 m
- **Adjusted Lateral Distance**: 2.19 m
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal 14.13 m/s (moving away), Lateral 0.27 m/s (moving away)
- **Motion**: Moving away longitudinally and laterally

**Analysis**:
- **Longitudinal**: Increasing distance with high relative speed of departure.
- **Lateral**: Mild increasing lateral separation.
- **TTC** and **MDC Both**: Indicate no threat or urgency given increasing separations and velocities diverging.

**Risk Assessment**: Both directions show safe divergence from the ego vehicle. Risk Score: **5 (Negligible)**.

**Obstacle 426 - Behind the ego vehicle**

- **Adjusted Longitudinal Distance**: -2.14 m
- **Adjusted Lateral Distance**: 0.00 m
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal 13.78 m/s (approaching), Lateral -0.06 m/s (minimal lateral motion)
- **Motion**: Driving toward with perfect lateral alignment

**Analysis**:
- **Longitudinal & Lateral**: Increased forward catch-up; lateral perfect line but substantial negative distance. Increasing velocity but ample room.
- **TTC**: Within positive timeframe beyond immediate intervention.
- **MDC**: Present but manageable due to initially large separation.

**Risk Assessment**: Though trailing and faster, moderate separation reduces urgency. Risk Score: **3 (Medium)**.

**Obstacle 431 - Rear-left of ego vehicle**

- **Adjusted Longitudinal Distance**: -3.30 m
- **Adjusted Lateral Distance**: 2.12 m
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal 13.65 m/s (approaching), Lateral -0.07 m/s (mild lateral motion toward)
- **Motion**: Approaching from rear with slight lateral approach

**Analysis**:
- **Longitudinal**: Approaching but still has room/time to interact.
- **Lateral**: Minimal lateral convergence, indicating more time before immediate risk.
- **TTC**: Indicators show beyond critical immediate.

**Risk Assessment**: Safe window more substantial due to ongoing separation. Risk Score: **4 (Low)**.

**JSON Summary:**

```json
{
    "CollisionObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "None",
        "OverallRiskScore": "N/A"
    },
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "221",
        "OverallRiskScore": "1"
    },
    "HighRiskObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "None",
        "OverallRiskScore": "N/A"
    }
}
```

**Conclusion**: Obstacle 221 presents an extreme risk due to perfect longitudinal alignment and fast-approaching velocity, while others maintain safe diversions.
