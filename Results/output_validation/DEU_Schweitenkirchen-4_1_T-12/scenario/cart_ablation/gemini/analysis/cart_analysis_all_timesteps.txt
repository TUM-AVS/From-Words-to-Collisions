At t=5.4s, Ego is in lanelet 178.  Obstacles 221, 386, and 431 are in different lanelets and pose no immediate risk. Obstacles 426 and 434 are in the same lanelet as Ego (178).

Obstacle 426: Located at (-363.2851, 862.9949), while Ego is at (-363.183, 859.0863).  Both are moving in roughly the same direction. Though the y-distance is small (~4 meters), Obstacle 426 is ahead of the Ego vehicle and decelerating slightly more than Ego. Based on their current trajectories, a collision is unlikely in the immediate future. Risk score: 3 (Medium Risk).

Obstacle 434:  Located at (-367.1332, 887.4781), while Ego is at (-363.183, 859.0863). This places Obstacle 434 significantly behind and to the left of Ego and also traveling faster (though accelerating marginally).  It does not represent an immediate collision risk. Risk score: 4 (Low risk).
