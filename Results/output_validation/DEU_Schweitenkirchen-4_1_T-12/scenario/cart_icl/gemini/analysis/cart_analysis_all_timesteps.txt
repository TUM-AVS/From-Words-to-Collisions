### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 221.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is in a different lane and poses no immediate threat.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason:  The obstacle's trajectory suggests no likely future collision.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 386.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is in a different lane and poses no immediate threat.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: The obstacle's trajectory suggests no likely future collision.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 426.0
- Distance Risk reason:  The obstacle is in the same lane but sufficiently far behind.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Ego is decelerating faster than the obstacle, increasing the distance between them.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- Obstacle ID: 431.0
- Distance Risk reason: The obstacle is in a different lane and poses no immediate threat.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: The obstacle's trajectory suggests no likely future collision.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 434.0
- Distance Risk reason: The obstacle is in the same lane and relatively close but not an immediate threat.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: Both vehicles are moving in the same direction with similar velocities but ego is decelerating. Further observation is needed, but currently, there is no imminent collision risk.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3


### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
No obstacle has a risk score of 0, indicating no collision.  No obstacle has a risk score of 1, indicating no extreme risk. The scenario is not a collision scenario.

### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
  "CollisionObstacles": [],
  "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null,
  "ScenarioAnalysis": {
    "IsCollisionScenario": false,
    "Reasoning": "No obstacle has a risk score of 0 or 1. All obstacles maintain safe distances and trajectories relative to the ego vehicle."
  }
}
