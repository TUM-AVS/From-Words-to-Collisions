### Obstacle Analysis:

#### Obstacle ID: 221.0
- **Distance Risk reason:** Obstacle 221.0 is in lanelet 179.0, separate from the ego vehicle which is in lanelet 178.0, maintaining a consistent position ahead of the ego vehicle. Relative lateral distance has increased slightly over time.
- **Distance safety score:** 4
- **Time Risk reason:** Relative velocities show that Obstacle 221.0 has been moving faster with moderate acceleration, consistently a forward trajectory. Trajectory and velocity analysis suggest no collision path is imminent.
- **Time safety score:** 4
- **Overall Risk score:** 4

#### Obstacle ID: 386.0
- **Distance Risk reason:** Obstacle 386.0 remains in lanelet 177.0, showing a clear lane separation from the ego vehicle. The lateral distance has been increasing as it is moving away.
- **Distance safety score:** 5
- **Time Risk reason:** The obstacle has a constant and faster velocity than the ego, with trajectories not leading to any crossing paths.
- **Time safety score:** 5
- **Overall Risk score:** 5

#### Obstacle ID: 426.0
- **Distance Risk reason:** Although this obstacle is in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle for some timestamps, it has consistently maintained a forward position without entering the ego vehicleâ€™s likely path.
- **Distance safety score:** 4
- **Time Risk reason:** Given the high constant velocity and moderate acceleration, the obstacle is moving parallel and away rather than towards the ego, reducing collision threat.
- **Time safety score:** 4
- **Overall Risk score:** 4

#### Obstacle ID: 431.0
- **Distance Risk reason:** The obstacle persists in lanelet 177.0, with a stable and separate path from the ego's lane. The lateral separation supports minimal collision risk.
- **Distance safety score:** 5
- **Time Risk reason:** Its consistent path and parallel acceleration suggest it is not on course to intersect with the ego vehicle's path.
- **Time safety score:** 5
- **Overall Risk score:** 5

#### Obstacle ID: 434.0
- **Distance Risk reason:** Newly appeared obstacle in lanelet 178.0. However, its position indicates that it is still ahead and separated, suggesting a low risk of collision.
- **Distance safety score:** 4
- **Time Risk reason:** With moderate acceleration and velocity, the obstacle indicates a parallel path similar to other vehicles, suggesting no future collision path with the ego.
- **Time safety score:** 4
- **Overall Risk score:** 4

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
- The analysis of the trajectory patterns, velocity, and acceleration trends of all obstacles over the past 10 timesteps indicates that none of the obstacles are on a collision course with the ego vehicle. All obstacles have maintained or increased their lateral distances and consistent velocities along parallel paths. This pattern reduces the possibility of collision to negligible levels.
