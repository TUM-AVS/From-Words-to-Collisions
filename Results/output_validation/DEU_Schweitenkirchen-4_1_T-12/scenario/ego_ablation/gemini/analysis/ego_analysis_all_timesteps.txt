Obstacle 426 is in direct collision with the ego vehicle at the most recent timestep (5.4 seconds).  Obstacle 431 is very close to the ego, with longitudinal distance of -1.18m and lateral distance of 1.39 m, and is approaching rapidly, posing an extreme risk. Obstacle 221 is also very close laterally (-0.77m) and though not immediately colliding, its lateral movement towards the ego represents a high risk.
