Obstacle 426 has collided with the ego vehicle as indicated by a real distance of 0.00 m in both longitudinal and lateral directions at t=5.4 seconds.  Obstacle 431 is very close to the ego vehicle at longitudinal -1.18m and lateral 1.39m and moving towards the ego car, posing an extreme risk. Obstacle 221 is alongside the ego vehicle and fairly close laterally, but its motion suggests it is moving away longitudinally, reducing the immediate risk. Other obstacles are further away.

**Risk Levels and Definitions:**
<Collision (Score: 0)>: Actual collision has occurred or is unavoidable within the next timestep.
<Extreme Risk (Score: 1)>: Immediate collision or very high likelihood of impact. Urgent action is required.
<High Risk (Score: 2)>: Close to collision or highly probable collision path. Needs prompt attention and quick manoeuvring.
<Medium Risk (Score: 3)>: Moderate collision risk but manageable with timely reactions and proper strategies.
<Low Risk (Score: 4)>: Minimal collision risk. The situation is controllable with sufficient time to react.
<Negligible Risk (Score: 5)>: No significant collision risk. Obstacles are either moving away or far enough not to interfere.
