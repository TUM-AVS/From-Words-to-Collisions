### Obstacle-by-Obstacle Analysis (Most Recent Timestep: 5.4 seconds)

---

#### **Obstacle 221 (Right of ego car)**
- **Adjusted Distance**: Longitudinal 0.00m (aligned), Lateral -0.77m  
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal 14.05 m/s (moving away), Lateral 4.80 m/s (approaching)  
- **Motion**: Exact longitudinal alignment. Obstacle is driving toward ego laterally from the right.  
- **TTC (Lateral)**: 0.77m / 4.80 m/s ≈ 0.16s (Extreme Risk)  
- **MDC**: 0.77m (High Risk)  
- **Trajectory**: Rapid lateral closing (from -1.53m to -0.77m in 0.1s). Longitudinal alignment but moving away.  
- **Risk**: **1 (Extreme Risk)** due to TTC < 0.5s in lateral dimension.

#### **Obstacle 386 (Front-left of ego car)**
- **Adjusted Distance**: Longitudinal 20.93m, Lateral 7.64m  
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal 14.67 m/s (moving away), Lateral 5.26 m/s (moving away)  
- **Motion**: Moving away in both dimensions.  
- **TTC**: N/A (diverging paths)  
- **MDC**: >5m (No Risk)  
- **Risk**: **5 (No Risk)**.

#### **Obstacle 426 (Collision of ego car)**
- **Adjusted Distance**: Longitudinal 0.00m, Lateral 0.00m  
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal 14.30 m/s, Lateral 4.84 m/s  
- **Motion**: Exact alignment in both dimensions (collision occurring).  
- **TTC**: 0s (Collision)  
- **MDC**: 0m (Collision)  
- **Risk**: **0 (Collision)**.

#### **Obstacle 431 (Rear-left of ego car)**
- **Adjusted Distance**: Longitudinal -1.18m, Lateral 1.39m  
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal 14.50 m/s (approaching from behind), Lateral 4.88 m/s (moving away)  
- **Motion**: Approaching longitudinally but moving away laterally.  
- **TTC (Longitudinal)**: 1.18m / 14.50 m/s ≈ 0.08s (Extreme Risk)  
- **MDC**: 1.39m (High Risk)  
- **Trajectory**: Rapid longitudinal closing (from -2.25m to -1.18m in 0.1s).  
- **Risk**: **1 (Extreme Risk)** due to TTC < 0.5s in longitudinal dimension.

#### **Obstacle 434 (Rear-right of ego car)**
- **Adjusted Distance**: Longitudinal -23.75m, Lateral -3.21m  
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal 13.09 m/s (approaching), Lateral 4.24 m/s (approaching)  
- **Motion**: Approaching from behind and laterally from the right.  
- **TTC (Longitudinal)**: 23.75m / 13.09 m/s ≈ 1.81s (Medium Risk)  
- **MDC**: 3.21m (Low Risk)  
- **Risk**: **3 (Medium Risk)**.

### Collision Scenario Determination
- **Obstacle 426** is in **collision (risk 0)** with the ego vehicle (0m distance in both dimensions).  
- **Obstacle 221** and **431** are at **Extreme Risk (risk 1)** due to TTC < 0.5s in critical dimensions.  

This is a **collision scenario** because at least one obstacle (426) is colliding, and two others (221, 431) are in extreme risk of collision.
