### Obstacle Analysis and Risk Assessment

**Obstacle 221** (Right)
- **Position 5.4s**: Longitudinal: 0.00m, Lateral: -0.77m
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal: 14.05 m/s, Lateral: 4.80 m/s
- **TTC (Longitudinal)**: Not relevant since relative velocity indicates lateral movement away
- **TTC (Lateral)**: Not applicable as vehicle moving away
- **MDC**: Given lateral movement away and zero longitudinal alignment, the relative paths won't result in a collision
- **Risk Assessment**: No Risk (5)

**Obstacle 386** (Front-Left)
- **Position 5.4s**: Longitudinal: 20.93m, Lateral: 7.64m
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal: 14.67 m/s, Lateral: 5.26 m/s
- **TTC**: Not applicable, as obstacle is moving away
- **MDC**: Distance continuously increasing
- **Risk Assessment**: No Risk (5)

**Obstacle 426** (Collision)
- **Position 5.4s**: Longitudinal: 0.00m, Lateral: 0.00m
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal: 14.30 m/s, Lateral: 4.84 m/s
- **TTC (Longitudinal and Lateral)**: Zero distance and velocities indicate contact
- **MDC**: Zero
- **Risk Assessment**: Collision (0)

**Obstacle 431** (Rear-Left)
- **Position 5.4s**: Longitudinal: -1.18m, Lateral: 1.39m
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal: 14.50 m/s, Lateral: 4.88 m/s
- **TTC (Longitudinal and Lateral)**: Short intervals and fast closing speed, but near miss trajectory
- **MDC**: Future position suggests non-collision path
- **Risk Assessment**: Low Risk (4)

**Obstacle 434** (Rear-Right)
- **Position 5.4s**: Longitudinal: -23.75m, Lateral: -3.21m
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal: 13.09 m/s, Lateral: 4.24 m/s
- **TTC**: Not applicable due to significant distance and moving path
- **MDC**: Long-distance suggests no current collision threat
- **Risk Assessment**: No Risk (5)

### Conclusion
Obstacle 426 is currently colliding with the ego vehicle, evidenced by zero distance in both longitudinal and lateral dimensions, indicating a physical overlap, thus marking this as a collision scenario.
