    - Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 1
    - Lateral Time Safety Score: 5
    - Overall Time Safety Score: 3.0
    - Overall Risk Score: 3

- Obstacle ID: 434
    - Relative Direction: Rear-right
    - Distance Risk Reason: DTClong is greater than 5m, but negative and increasing. DTClat is greater than 1 but less than 3 which implies a medium risk.
    - Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 4
    - Lateral Distance Safety Score: 3
    - Overall Distance Safety Score: 3.5
    - Time Risk Reason: TTClong is greater than 1s but less than 3s, and decreasing which poses medium risk. TTClat shows medium risk with values greater than 0.5s but less than 1.0s and decreasing significantly.
    - Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 3
    - Lateral Time Safety Score: 2
    - Overall Time Safety Score: 2.5
    - Overall Risk Score: 3
