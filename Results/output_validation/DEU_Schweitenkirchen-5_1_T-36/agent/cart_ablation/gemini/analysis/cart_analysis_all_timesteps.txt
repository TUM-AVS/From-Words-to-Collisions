Here's the collision risk analysis:

**Obstacle 60:** This obstacle is far from the ego vehicle and moving away. It poses no immediate risk. Risk score: 5

**Obstacle 542:**  This obstacle is in a different lane and maintains a safe lateral distance.  While relatively close longitudinally, the trajectories don't appear to intersect. Risk score: 4

**Obstacle 594:** This obstacle is in a different lane and maintains some lateral distance. The trajectories don't appear to intersect. Risk score: 4

**Obstacle 625:** This obstacle is in the same lane as the ego vehicle and relatively close.  The distance is decreasing over time. This presents a high risk of collision if the ego vehicle does not decelerate or change lanes. Risk score: 2

**Obstacle 634:** This obstacle is in adjacent lane to the ego vehicle and relatively close. Based on the provided data, the distance and relative speeds suggest a medium risk.  The ego vehicle should monitor this obstacle but there is more time to react than with Obstacle 625. Risk score: 3
