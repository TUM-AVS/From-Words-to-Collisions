Obstacle 60: This vehicle is in a different lanelet (162) than the ego vehicle (179), and their positions and trajectories suggest they are not on a collision course. Risk score: 5 (Negligible Risk)

Obstacle 542: This vehicle is in lanelet 177, adjacent to the ego vehicle's lanelet 179. While their y-positions (longitudinal positions) are somewhat close, the x-positions (lateral positions) show sufficient separation, and the trajectories do not indicate convergence that would lead to a collision. Risk score: 4 (Low Risk)


Obstacle 594: This vehicle is in lanelet 178, adjacent to the ego vehicle. Over the time steps, the y-position difference shrinks slightly, but the lateral separation (x-position difference) remains consistent, and the trajectories suggest this will continue. Risk score: 4 (Low Risk).

Obstacle 625: This vehicle is in the same lanelet (179) as the ego vehicle.  Critically, the y-positions show that this obstacle is ahead of the ego vehicle, and the difference in their y-positions is decreasing over time. This indicates the ego vehicle is approaching obstacle 625. While a collision is not imminent within the observed time frame, the closing distance warrants attention and requires monitoring. Risk score: 3 (Medium Risk).

Obstacle 634: This vehicle is in lanelet 178, adjacent to the ego vehicle's lanelet. Its trajectory and positions present no immediate collision risk with the ego vehicle over the observed time period. Risk score: 4 (Low Risk).
