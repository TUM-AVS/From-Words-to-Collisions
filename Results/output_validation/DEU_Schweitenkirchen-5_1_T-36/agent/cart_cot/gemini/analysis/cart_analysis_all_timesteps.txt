Obstacle 625 is in the same lane as the ego vehicle and shows a decreasing distance over the reported timesteps.  A more detailed analysis, incorporating TTC and MDC, is required to precisely determine the risk, but it appears to be elevated. Other obstacles maintain a safe distance and lateral separation from the ego vehicle.
