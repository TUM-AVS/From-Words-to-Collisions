Obstacle 625 is in the same lane as the ego vehicle and is relatively close.  It's moving slightly slower than the ego vehicle, leading to a decreasing distance between them.  While not immediately dangerous, it requires monitoring.

Obstacle 594 is in the adjacent lane and also relatively close.  Its trajectory and speed suggest it might merge into the ego vehicle's lane, posing a potential risk.  Further observation is needed.

Obstacle 542 is in the other adjacent lane, and while currently not a direct threat, its proximity and speed warrant observation in case of unexpected lane changes.
