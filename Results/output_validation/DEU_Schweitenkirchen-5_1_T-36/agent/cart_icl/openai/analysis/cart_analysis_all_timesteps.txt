Given the provided data and instructed analysis, we need to examine the final timestep first (at 5.6 seconds) to evaluate risk levels for each obstacle. We'll perform the evaluation using Time to Collision (TTC), relative motion assessment, and considering the minimum distance to collision (MDC) principles.

### Analysis:

1. **Ego Vehicle**
   - Position: (-342.9332, 911.8085), Velocity: 16.451 m/s

2. **Obstacle 542.0**
   - Position: (-336.0405, 913.5820), Velocity: 21.7604 m/s
   - Relative Longitudinal Distance: ~6.9 meters ahead
   - Relative Velocity: 21.7604 - 16.451 = 5.3094 m/s (approaching)
   - **TTC:** ~6.9 / 5.3094 ≈ 1.3 seconds
   - **Assessment:** High risk due to low TTC and proximity.

3. **Obstacle 594.0**
   - Position: (-337.0743, 897.0022), Velocity: 24.7972 m/s
   - Not positioned directly in immediate path
   - **Assessment:** Low risk due to the different lanelet and trajectory away from Ego.

4. **Obstacle 625.0**
   - Position: (-343.6653, 917.3143), Velocity: 23.5648 m/s
   - Relative Longitudinal Distance: ~5.5 meters ahead
   - Relative Velocity: 23.5648 - 16.451 = 7.1138 m/s (approaching)
   - **TTC:** ~5.5 / 7.1138 ≈ 0.77 seconds
   - **Assessment:** Extreme risk due to very low TTC in the same lanelet.

5. **Obstacle 634.0**
   - Position: (-341.9087, 929.4702), Velocity: 22.0333 m/s
   - Positioned further and moving in a different trajectory
   - **Assessment:** Medium to low risk due to safer distance.

### Overall Riskiness:

Based on the last timestamp and evaluating the metrics:

- Obstacle **625.0** poses significant risk with a TTC under 1 second and is in the same lane, suggesting an imminent risk of collision (Extreme Risk - 1).
- Obstacle **542.0** has a slightly higher TTC but still presents a high-risk situation due to the closing speed and proximity.

### Output JSON:

```json
{
    "CollisionObstacles": [],
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "625.0",
        "OverallRiskScore": 1
    },
    "HighRiskObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "542.0",
        "OverallRiskScore": 2
    }
}
```

This output provides a structured risk assessment based on the timeline insights and latest positional and velocity data.
