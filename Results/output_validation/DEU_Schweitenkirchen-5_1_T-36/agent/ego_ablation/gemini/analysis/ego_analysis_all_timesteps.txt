At time 5.6 seconds, the following analysis is observed for each obstacle:

* **Obstacle 542:** Located to the left (lateral 5.48 m) with exact longitudinal alignment with the ego vehicle.  Lateral velocity suggests it's moving towards the ego vehicle (-0.59 m/s), but the distance is significant, and the longitudinal motion is aligned with the ego vehicle, indicating a low risk of collision. Scores: Proximity (4), MDC (5), TTC (5). Overall risk is low.

* **Obstacle 594:** Situated front-left of the ego vehicle, moving further away longitudinally (11.08 m). The lateral distance of 1.62 m is somewhat close but the relative velocity (-0.30 m/s) and acceleration indicate the risk is minimal. Scores: Proximity (4), MDC (5), TTC (5). Overall risk is negligible.

* **Obstacle 625:**  Positioned behind the ego vehicle and closing in longitudinally (-1.04 m). This represents the most immediate risk in this scenario. The lateral alignment with the ego vehicle makes a potential rear-end collision possible if the ego vehicle brakes suddenly or Obstacle 625 doesn't decelerate sufficiently. Scores: Proximity (2), MDC (2), TTC (2). Overall risk is high (2).

* **Obstacle 634:**  Trailing the ego vehicle from the rear-left (-12.72 m longitudinal, 2.43 m lateral). It's approaching longitudinally (5.57 m/s) and laterally (-0.60 m/s), but the distances and relative velocities indicate a medium risk. Scores: Proximity (3), MDC (4), TTC (4). Overall risk is medium.
