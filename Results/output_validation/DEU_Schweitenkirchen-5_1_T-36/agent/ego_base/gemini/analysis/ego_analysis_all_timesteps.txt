At timestamp 5.6 seconds, let's analyze the risk posed by each obstacle:

* **Obstacle 542:** This obstacle is driving alongside the ego vehicle, slightly to the left with 0 longitudinal distance and a lateral distance of 5.48 m. Its relative longitudinal velocity (5.30 m/s) suggests it's moving in the same general direction as the ego vehicle but slightly slower or the ego vehicle is accelerating. The lateral velocity (-0.59 m/s) indicates it's moving towards the ego car. This obstacle does not pose an immediate collision risk, but its proximity and lateral movement require attention. Therefore it is considered medium risk (risk score 3).

* **Obstacle 594:** This obstacle is well ahead of the ego vehicle to the left (longitudinal distance 11.08 m, lateral distance 1.62 m), and is moving away longitudinally (8.34 m/s). While it is moving slightly towards the ego car laterally (-0.30 m/s), the large longitudinal distance and the direction of travel suggest there is no immediate risk. This obstacle is considered low risk (risk score 4).

* **Obstacle 625:** Located almost directly behind the ego car (longitudinal distance -1.04 m, lateral distance 0.00 m).  Its longitudinal velocity (7.11 m/s) indicates it is approaching the ego car rapidly from behind. The combination of close proximity and high approaching speed presents a significant collision risk if the ego vehicle were to brake suddenly or if obstacle 625 doesn't decelerate. High Risk (Risk score 2).

* **Obstacle 634:** This obstacle is behind and to the left of the ego vehicle (longitudinal distance -12.72 m, lateral distance 2.43 m), and is approaching from behind (longitudinal velocity 6.57 m/s).  It is also moving slightly toward the ego vehicle laterally (-0.60 m/s). Although it is approaching, its distance and the moderate relative speed suggest a low risk (risk score 4).

Risk Levels:
0: Collision - Physical contact occurred or unavoidable
1: Extreme Risk - Immediate collision likely
2: High Risk - Close to collision, needs quick action
3: Medium Risk - Manageable with proper reaction
4: Low Risk - Minimal risk, sufficient time to react
5: Negligible Risk - No significant risk
