### Safety analysis for timestep 5.6s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

**Assumptions and Clarifications:**

* **Missing Adjusted Distances:** The provided context lacks crucial `adjusted_d_long` and `adjusted_d_lat` values.  These are essential for accurate collision risk assessment. Since they're absent, I will use the provided `real distance` values, acknowledging this reduces the analysis accuracy.  **It is strongly recommended to provide adjusted distances in the future.**
* **TTC Calculation:**  TTC will be approximated using distance and relative velocity: `TTC = distance / relative_velocity`.  Since we have longitudinal and lateral components, we'll calculate `TTClong` and `TTClat` separately.  A negative TTC indicates the object is moving away or the situation is already dangerous if very close.
* **Lateral Risk:**  Purely lateral movements (e.g., an obstacle parallel to the ego vehicle but moving sideways towards it) present a challenge with this limited information.  We lack the vehicle widths to determine if a lateral collision is imminent. I'll make inferences based on lateral distance and velocity, but more data would improve accuracy.
* **Overall Risk:**  The overall risk score will be the lower of the distance and time risk scores, as both proximity and imminence of a collision need to be considered. The overall risk score will be the minimum score of any TTC calculation.

### Obstacle Analysis:

**- Obstacle ID: 60**
- Distance Risk reason: At 5.6 seconds, Obstacle 60 is directly alongside the ego vehicle (0.0m longitudinal and lateral distance), implying it occupies the same lane and a collision is very likely occurring.
- Distance safety score: 0
- Time Risk reason: It has been merged into ego car, hence TTC is meaningless. 
- Time safety score: 0
- Overall Risk score: 0 

**- Obstacle ID: 542**
- Distance Risk reason:  Obstacle 542 is only 0.0m meters to the left of the ego car and 0.0m meters behind the ego car, so it occupies the same lane, which implies that a collision has already happened.
- Distance safety score: 0
- Time Risk reason: Because Obstacle 542 has already hit the ego car, TTC calculation is not meaningful.
- Time safety score: 0
- Overall Risk score: 0

**- Obstacle ID: 594**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 594 is at a safe distance in front and to the left of the ego car (11.08m longitudinal and lateral distance).
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: It's moving away longitudinally, and the significant lateral distance implies no immediate lateral risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

**- Obstacle ID: 625**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 625 is very close behind the ego car (-1.04 meters longitudinal, -1.04 meters lateral).
- Distance safety score: 1
- Time Risk reason: The low longitudinal distance combined with its approaching velocity suggests a high risk of a rear-end collision.
- Time safety score: 1
- Overall Risk score: 1

**- Obstacle ID: 634**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 634 is at a relatively safe distance behind and to the left of the ego vehicle (-12.72m longitudinal, -12.72 meters lateral).
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: It's approaching from behind, but the TTC suggests there's some time to react. Lateral movement doesn't pose an immediate threat.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4
