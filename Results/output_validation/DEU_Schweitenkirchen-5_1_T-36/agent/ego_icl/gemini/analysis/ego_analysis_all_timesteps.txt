* **Obstacle 542 (Left):** This obstacle is alongside the ego vehicle. The lateral distance is 5.48m. While the longitudinal distance is 0.00m, this indicates alignment, not a collision.  The lateral velocity is -0.59 m/s, meaning it's slightly moving away from the ego vehicle laterally. Given the lateral distance and separating lateral velocity, the risk is low.
    * _MDC Assessment:_ Approximately 5.48m (primarily lateral).  Risk level: Low (4)
    * _TTC Assessment:_ Not applicable laterally due to separating velocity. Longitudinally, TTC is not applicable due to zero distance and positive velocity. Risk level: Negligible (5).
    * _Overall Risk:_ Low (4)

* **Obstacle 594 (Front-left):** This obstacle is ahead and to the left of the ego vehicle.  It's moving away longitudinally (11.08m and 8.34 m/s) and slightly toward the ego laterally (1.62m and -0.30 m/s). The longitudinal motion significantly reduces risk. The slow lateral closing velocity at this distance poses minimal risk.
    * _MDC Assessment:_ Approximately 11.2m. Risk level: Negligible (5)
    * _TTC Assessment:_  Longitudinally, TTC is high due to the separating velocity. Laterally, TTC ~5.4 seconds. Risk Level: Low (4).
    * _Overall Risk:_ Low (4)

* **Obstacle 625 (Behind):** This obstacle is directly behind the ego vehicle and is quite close longitudinally (-1.04 m) and laterally (0.00 m). This alignment, combined with a closing longitudinal velocity of 7.11 m/s, indicates high risk.
    * _MDC Assessment:_ Approximately 1.04m. Risk level: High (2)
    * _TTC Assessment:_ Longitudinally, TTC is approximately 0.15 seconds. Risk level: Extreme (1).
    * _Overall Risk:_ Extreme (1)

* **Obstacle 634 (Rear-left):** This obstacle is behind and to the left of the ego vehicle.  The longitudinal distance is -12.72m with a closing velocity of 5.57 m/s, and the lateral distance is 2.43m with a closing velocity of -0.60 m/s.  The lateral movement is slightly away from the ego vehicle, while the longitudinal motion presents a low to medium risk.
    * _MDC Assessment:_ Approximately 12.95m. Risk level: Negligible (5)
    * _TTC Assessment:_ Laterally, TTC is not applicable due to the separating velocity. Longitudinally TTC is approximately 2.3 seconds. Risk level: Medium (3).
    * _Overall Risk:_ Medium (3)
