### Obstacle-by-Obstacle Analysis:

#### Obstacle 542:
- **Position & Motion**: Positioned to the Left of the ego car. Exact longitudinal alignment, approaching laterally.
- **Adjustments & Measurements**: Adjusted longitudinal distance is 0.00 m and lateral is 5.48 m. Relative velocities: longitudinal 5.30 m/s, lateral -0.59 m/s.
- **Trajectory Analysis**: Historically shown alignment over time, maintaining lateral closure.
- **TTC & MDC**: 
  - For lateral approach, TTC = 5.48 / 0.59 = 9.29 s (lateral).
  - With exact longitudinal alignment, no collision risk along that dimension.
- **Risk Assessment**: No Risk in lateral closure with a TTC > 5s.

#### Obstacle 594:
- **Position & Motion**: Front-left of ego vehicle, moving away longitudinally and laterally approaching.
- **Adjustments & Measurements**: Adjusted longitudinal distance is 11.08 m, lateral is 1.62 m. Relative velocities: longitudinal 8.34 m/s, lateral -0.30 m/s.
- **Trajectory Analysis**: Lateral approach decreases slightly over time but sporadic.
- **TTC & MDC**:
  - TTC lateral = 1.62 / 0.30 = 5.40 s (lateral).
  - Longitudinal safe as moving away.
- **Risk Assessment**: Near No Risk with lateral TTC very near 5s threshold, overall considered minimal risk.

#### Obstacle 625:
- **Position & Motion**: Behind ego, exact lateral alignment.
- **Adjustments & Measurements**: Adjusted longitudinal distance is -1.04 m, lateral 0.00 m. Relative velocities: longitudinal 7.11 m/s, lateral -0.64 m/s.
- **Trajectory Analysis**: Closing from the rear and laterally aligned.
- **TTC & MDC**: 
  - Longitudinal TTC = 1.04 / 7.11 = 0.15 s. This indicates quick closure.
- **Risk Assessment**: Extreme Risk with TTC < 0.5s on longitudinal approach.

#### Obstacle 634:
- **Position & Motion**: Rear-left, moving diagonally towards the ego.
- **Adjustments & Measurements**: Adjusted longitudinal distance is -12.72 m, lateral 2.43 m. Relative velocities: longitudinal 5.57 m/s, lateral -0.60 m/s.
- **Trajectory Analysis**: Continues the rear approach, cross-lateral approach.
- **TTC & MDC**:
  - TTC longitudinal = 12.72 / 5.57 = 2.28 s.
  - TTC lateral = 2.43 / 0.60 = 4.05 s.
- **Risk Assessment**: Medium Risk with TTC longitudinal <3s and lateral just over 3s on this trajectory. Both diminishing, but not imminently critical.

### Explanation

The Obstacle 625 represents the highest risk due to an extremely low Time-to-Collision (0.15s) in the longitudinal dimension from behind, indicating potential rapid rear-end approach. The lateral distancing is stable but longitudinal proximity increases risk scoring to extreme.

Obstacle 542 and 594 are assessed as not presenting significant immediate risk based on stable or longer TTC and adequate maintained adjusted distances. Obstacle 634 presents a lower risk due to longer TTCs in both dimensions.
