At t=5.8s, Ego is in lanelet 179. Obstacles 542 and 594 are in different lanelets and pose no immediate threat. Obstacles 625 and 634 require closer examination.

Obstacle 625 is in the same lanelet as Ego and its y-coordinate (912.5786) is approaching Ego's (908.5731). Given the velocities, a collision is likely imminent.  This is a high risk situation.

Obstacle 634, while in a different lanelet (178), is also quite close to Ego in terms of y-coordinate (925.0456 vs. 908.5731). Considering the proximity and velocities, there's a possibility of lane change by either vehicle leading to a collision. This also represents a high risk.
