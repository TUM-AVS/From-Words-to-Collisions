At t=5.8s, Obstacle 625 is in the same lanelet (179) as the ego vehicle and is relatively close.  Examining the trajectories from t=4.9s onwards, both Obstacle 625 and the ego vehicle are moving in roughly the same direction and with similar orientations. Obstacle 625's position (-342.9723, 912.5786) compared to the ego's (-342.3966, 908.5731) indicates proximity. Moreover, Obstacle 625 has a higher velocity (24.0512 vs. 16.5365) than the ego vehicle. Although the distance isn't extremely small at this instant, the velocity difference and lane sharing suggest a rapidly increasing risk of collision in the immediate future if the ego vehicle doesn't decelerate or Obstacle 625 doesn't accelerate significantly.  This classifies as an Extreme Risk (1).
