### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 542.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is in a different lane and relatively far from the ego vehicle.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason:  The obstacle's trajectory does not intersect with the ego vehicle's.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 594.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is in a different lane and poses no immediate threat.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: The obstacle is moving faster than the ego vehicle but the trajectories are diverging.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- Obstacle ID: 625.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is in the same lane and relatively close to the ego vehicle.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: Obstacle is moving faster than the ego vehicle, potentially leading to a dangerous situation if the ego vehicle does not accelerate or the obstacle decelerates.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3

- Obstacle ID: 634.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is in a different lane and moderately far from the ego vehicle.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: The obstacle's trajectory poses no immediate risk.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
This is not a collision scenario. No obstacles are on a direct collision course with the ego vehicle within the predicted timeframe.  While obstacle 625 is in the same lane and relatively close, it's moving faster, so a collision is unlikely if speeds are maintained.

### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
  "CollisionObstacles": null,
  "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null,
  "ScenarioAnalysis": {
    "IsCollisionScenario": false,
    "Reasoning": "No obstacles are predicted to collide with the ego vehicle. While obstacle 625 is in the same lane and closer than others, it's moving faster, reducing the risk of immediate collision."
  }
}
