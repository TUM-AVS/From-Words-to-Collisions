### Obstacle Analysis:

#### Obstacle ID: 542.0
- **Distance Risk Reason**: Obstacle is located consistently in a different lanelet than the ego vehicle (lanelet 177.0 for the obstacle versus lanelet 179.0 for ego). Positions indicate it is moving further away laterally over time.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 5
- **Time Risk Reason**: Steady velocity and controlled acceleration observed; gradual increase in distance.
- **Time Safety Score**: 4
- **Overall Risk Score**: 4

#### Obstacle ID: 594.0
- **Distance Risk Reason**: Situated in lanelet 178.0, and its trajectory is consistently moving diagonally away from the ego vehicle; not in immediate collision path.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 4
- **Time Risk Reason**: Fast velocity but high distance and no conflicting lane movement with the ego; maintains trajectory away from ego's path.
- **Time Safety Score**: 4
- **Overall Risk Score**: 4

#### Obstacle ID: 625.0
- **Distance Risk Reason**: This obstacle is in lanelet 179.0, same as the ego vehicle. It is trailing the ego vehicle from the same lane, closing the gap in Y-axis somewhat over time but not critically close.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 3
- **Time Risk Reason**: Increased speed and acceleration observed. Moving faster than the ego could indicate catching up; however, sufficient relative distance maintained at current observation.
- **Time Safety Score**: 3
- **Overall Risk Score**: 3

#### Obstacle ID: 634.0
- **Distance Risk Reason**: Consistently in a different lanelet (178.0), moving parallel but slightly further each timestep; high Y coordinate indicates relative moving away.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 5
- **Time Risk Reason**: Consistent speed in line with trajectory path, which is not converging towards the ego vehicle.
- **Time Safety Score**: 5
- **Overall Risk Score**: 5

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. Analyzed all obstacles during the last timestep, focusing on their lanes, y-coordinates, and distances relative to ego.
2. Consistently observed trends of obstacles moving away or maintaining safe longitudinal distance over the prior steps.
3. No obstacles showed a sudden change in velocity or direction indicating immediate risk.
4. No proximity overlaps or lane intersecting turns were detected in the recent timestep.
