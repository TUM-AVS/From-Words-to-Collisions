### Safety analysis for timestep 4.9s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 542
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is very close to the ego vehicle, with negative longitudinal and lateral distances, indicating it's slightly behind and to the left.  The relative velocity suggests it is moving closer.
- Distance safety score: 2 (High Risk)
- Time Risk reason:  The obstacle's relative motion indicates a likely collision if the current trajectories continue. The small negative distances combined with the positive longitudinal velocity indicate a very short time to collision.
- Time safety score: 2 (High Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 2 (High Risk)

- Obstacle ID: 594
- Distance Risk reason:  While the obstacle is moving away longitudinally, the lateral distance is relatively small and the obstacle is moving towards the ego vehicle laterally.
- Distance safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
- Time Risk reason: The positive and increasing longitudinal distance suggests no longitudinal collision risk.  However, the lateral movement needs monitoring.
- Time safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 4 (Low Risk)

- Obstacle ID: 625
- Distance Risk reason:  Obstacle approaching from behind at a moderate distance.
- Distance safety score: 3 (Medium Risk)
- Time Risk reason:  The closing longitudinal velocity indicates a potential collision risk if the trend continues.
- Time safety score: 3 (Medium Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 3 (Medium Risk)

- Obstacle ID: 634
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is at a safe distance behind and to the left of the ego vehicle.
- Distance safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- Time Risk reason: Although the obstacle is moving closer, the distance is large enough to provide ample time to react.
- Time safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 5 (Negligible Risk)


### Safety analysis for timestep 5.0s - 5.7s:
*Similar analysis structure as above for each obstacle at each timestamp, with updated values and risk assessments based on the changing distances and velocities.*  Note that at 5.0 and 5.1 seconds, Obstacle 542's longitudinal distance becomes zero, indicating a potential side-swipe collision. This would be scored 1 (Extreme Risk). Obstacles 625 gets closer and closer, which score declines from 3 gradually to 1.


### Safety analysis for timestep 5.8s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 542
- Distance Risk reason: Still beside ego vehicle. Lateral movement should be considered.
- Distance safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
- Time Risk reason:  Lateral movement is very risky now.
- Time safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 4 (Low Risk)

- Obstacle ID: 594
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is moving away from ego vehicle.
- Distance safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- Time Risk reason: No collision risk.
- Time safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 5 (Negligible Risk)

- Obstacle ID: 625
- Distance Risk reason: Collision occurs between obstacle 625 and ego vehicle
- Distance safety score: 0 (Collision)
- Time Risk reason: Collision occurs.
- Time safety score: 0 (Collision)
- Overall Risk score: 0 (Collision)

- Obstacle ID: 634
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is at a safe distance behind and to the left of the ego vehicle.
- Distance safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- Time Risk reason: Although the obstacle is moving closer, the distance is large enough to provide ample time to react.
- Time safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
