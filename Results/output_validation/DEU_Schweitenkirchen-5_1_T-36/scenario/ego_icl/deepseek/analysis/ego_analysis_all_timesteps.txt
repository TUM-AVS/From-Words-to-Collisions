### Obstacle-by-Obstacle Analysis (Most Recent Timestep: 5.8s)

#### **Obstacle 542 (Left of ego car)**
- **Adjusted Distances**: Longitudinal = 0.00m (exact alignment), Lateral = 5.40m  
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal = 5.59 m/s (approaching), Lateral = -0.39 m/s (approaching from left)  
- **Trajectory**:  
  - Longitudinal: Exact alignment (0.00m) but moving forward (positive velocity). No collision risk longitudinally.  
  - Lateral: Slowly closing (5.40m → 5.40m over 0.1s). Minimal lateral convergence.  
- **TTC**:  
  - Lateral TTC = 5.40 / 0.39 ≈ 13.85s (No Risk, TTC > 5s)  
- **MDC**: Lateral distance = 5.40m (No Risk, MDC > 5m)  
- **Risk**: **5 (No Risk)**

#### **Obstacle 594 (Front-left of ego car)**
- **Adjusted Distances**: Longitudinal = 12.72m (front), Lateral = 1.75m (left)  
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal = 8.21 m/s (moving away), Lateral = -0.07 m/s (negligible lateral motion)  
- **Trajectory**:  
  - Rapidly moving away longitudinally (12.72m at 5.8s vs. 11.91m at 5.7s).  
  - Lateral motion is negligible.  
- **TTC**: Not applicable (diverging paths).  
- **MDC**: Lateral distance = 1.75m (Medium Risk, 1.0 < MDC ≤ 3.0m)  
- **Risk**: **3 (Medium Risk)**

#### **Obstacle 625 (Collision of ego car)**
- **Adjusted Distances**: Longitudinal = 0.00m, Lateral = 0.00m  
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal = 7.51 m/s (collision occurred), Lateral = -0.43 m/s (minor post-collision motion)  
- **Trajectory**:  
  - At 5.7s: Longitudinal = -0.29m (approaching from behind).  
  - At 5.8s: Exact alignment (0.00m, 0.00m) with high closing velocity.  
- **Collision Confirmation**:  
  - Zero distance in both dimensions + high closing velocity → **Collision occurring**.  
- **Risk**: **0 (Collision)**

#### **Obstacle 634 (Rear-left of ego car)**
- **Adjusted Distances**: Longitudinal = -11.56m (rear), Lateral = 2.19m (left)  
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal = 5.89 m/s (approaching from behind), Lateral = -0.40 m/s (approaching from left)  
- **Trajectory**:  
  - Slowly closing longitudinally (-11.56m at 5.8s vs. -12.14m at 5.7s).  
  - Lateral convergence is minimal (2.19m → 2.26m over 0.1s).  
- **TTC**:  
  - Longitudinal TTC = 11.56 / 5.89 ≈ 1.96s (Medium Risk, 1.0 < TTC ≤ 3.0s).  
- **MDC**: Lateral distance = 2.19m (Medium Risk, 1.0 < MDC ≤ 3.0m).  
- **Risk**: **3 (Medium Risk)**

### **Collision Scenario Determination**
- **Obstacle 625** has a risk score of **0 (Collision)** due to zero distance in both dimensions and high closing velocity.  
- No other obstacles meet Extreme Risk (score 1) criteria.
