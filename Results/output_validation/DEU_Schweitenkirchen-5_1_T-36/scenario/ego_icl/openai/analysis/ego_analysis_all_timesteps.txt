### Analysis of Obstacles at 5.8 seconds:

**Obstacle 542: (Left)**
- **Adjusted Distances:** Longitudinal = 0.00 m, Lateral = 5.40 m
- **Relative Velocity:** Longitudinal = 5.59 m/s, Lateral = -0.39 m/s
- **Trajectory Analysis:** 
  - Longitudinally aligned with the ego vehicle but with non-zero lateral distance. Approaching laterally with a decreasing lateral distance over time.
  
- **TTC Calculation:**
  - Lateral TTC = 5.40 / 0.39 ≈ 13.85 seconds
  - Longitudinal TTC calculation not applicable since alignment but not convergence in that sense.
  
- **MDC Calculation:** Takes into priority lateral distance since longitudinal is zero.
  - MDC ≈ 5.40 m initially decreasing but moderate velocity.

- **Risk Assessment:** 
  - With lateral distance > 5.0m and decreasing trend with moderate velocity, considered a "Low Risk" (Risk Score = 4).

**Obstacle 594: (Front-Left)**
- **Adjusted Distances:** Longitudinal = 11.08 m, Lateral = 1.75 m
- **Relative Velocity:** Longitudinal = 8.21 m/s, Lateral = -0.07 m/s
- **Trajectory Analysis:** 
  - Moving away longitudinally; however, moving slightly towards ego laterally in past frames.

- **TTC Calculation:**
  - Longitudinal TTC = 11.08 / 8.21 ≈ 1.35 seconds (moving away so more of a theoretical value)
  - Lateral TTC = 1.75 / 0.07 ≈ 25.00 seconds

- **MDC Calculation:** 
  - Longitudinally moving away: increasing distance.
  
- **Risk Assessment:**
  - Mainly moving away. Low relative closing rate laterally; hence, "No Risk" (Risk Score = 5).

**Obstacle 625: (Behind)**
- **Adjusted Distances:** Longitudinal = 0.00 m, Lateral = 0.00 m
- **Relative Velocity:** Longitudinal = 7.51 m/s, Lateral = -0.43 m/s
- **Trajectory Analysis:** 
  - Indicating potential collision due to zero distances.

- **TTC Calculation:**
  - Longitudinal TTC = 0.00 m / 7.51 m/s = 0, actual collision in progress or likely occurred.
  - Lateral TTC similarly negligible.

- **MDC Calculation:** 
  - MDC is zero, as distances are precisely zero.

- **Risk Assessment:**
  - Both adjusted distances near zero with significant closing velocity suggest a "Collision Risk" (Risk Score = 0).
  
**Obstacle 634: (Rear-Left)**
- **Adjusted Distances:** Longitudinal = -11.56 m, Lateral = 2.19 m
- **Relative Velocity:** Longitudinal = 5.89 m/s, Lateral = -0.40 m/s
- **Trajectory Analysis:** 
  - Approaching from behind but not directly aligned longitudinally with ego.

- **TTC Calculation:**
  - Longitudinal TTC = 11.56 / 5.89 ≈ 1.96 seconds 
  - Lateral TTC = 2.19 / 0.40 ≈ 5.48 seconds

- **MDC Calculation:** 
  - Considering relative direction primarily rear-lateral converge but not immediate.

- **Risk Assessment:**
  - Lateral approaching but not extreme; "Medium Risk" (Risk Score = 3).

### Conclusion:
- **Collision Detected:** Obstacle 625 exhibits zero adjusted distances with significant closing velocity, confirming a collision scenario.
