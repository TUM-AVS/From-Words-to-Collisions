### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
                    - Obstacle ID: 542
                    - Relative Direction: Left
                    - Distance Risk Reason: DTClat is > 5, indicating negligible lateral risk, which is dominant for a Left direction obstacle. DTClong is 0 which means same longitudinal position as ego vehicle.  Over time, lateral distance has decreased slightly, but remains safe.
                    - Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 0
                    - Lateral Distance Safety Score: 5
                    - Overall Distance Safety Score: 5.0
                    - Time Risk Reason: TTClat is > 5, indicating negligible lateral risk, which is dominant as the obstacle is to the Left.  TTClong is 0, but this is not factored in as wdominant is 0 for Left. TTClat has consistently decreased over the past timesteps, suggesting potential increasing lateral risk in future if this trend continues.
                    - Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 0
                    - Lateral Time Safety Score: 5
                    - Overall Time Safety Score: 5.0
                    - Overall Risk Score: 5

                    - Obstacle ID: 594
                    - Relative Direction: Front-left
                    - Distance Risk Reason: Both DTClong and DTClat are > 1 and <3 indicating low risk but DTClat has decreasing trend over time.
                    - Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 4
                    - Lateral Distance Safety Score: 3
                    - Overall Distance Safety Score: 3.5
                    - Time Risk Reason: TTClong is inf, indicating negligible longitudinal risk. TTClat is < 3, suggesting a medium lateral risk, and TTClat has a rapidly decreasing trend over timesteps, indicating increasing risk.
                    - Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 5
                    - Lateral Time Safety Score: 2
                    - Overall Time Safety Score: 3.5
                    - Overall Risk Score: 4

                    - Obstacle ID: 625
                    - Relative Direction: Behind
                    - Distance Risk Reason: The obstacle is behind the ego vehicle. DTClong is < 0 and > -1, suggesting it is relatively close but not an immediate collision risk longitudinally.  DTClat is 0 meaning it's directly behind the ego vehicle.
                    - Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 1
                    - Lateral Distance Safety Score: 0
                    - Overall Distance Safety Score: 1.0
                    - Time Risk Reason:  TTClong is < 0.5 indicating extreme longitudinal risk. TTClat is 0. For Behind, the longitudinal component dominates.
                    - Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 1
                    - Lateral Time Safety Score: 0
                    - Overall Time Safety Score: 1.0
                    - Overall Risk Score: 1

                    - Obstacle ID: 634
                    - Relative Direction: Rear-left
                    - Distance Risk Reason: DTClong is < -5, indicating negligible longitudinal risk. DTClat is < 5, representing low lateral risk, which dominates for a rear-left direction obstacle. Both metrics show movement towards the ego vehicle.
                    - Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 5
                    - Lateral Distance Safety Score: 4
                    - Overall Distance Safety Score: 4.5
                    - Time Risk Reason: TTClong is > 1 and < 3 indicating medium longitudinal risk. TTClat is >1 and < 3 showing medium risk.  
                    - Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 3
                    - Lateral Time Safety Score: 3
                    - Overall Time Safety Score: 3.0
                    - Overall Risk Score: 4
