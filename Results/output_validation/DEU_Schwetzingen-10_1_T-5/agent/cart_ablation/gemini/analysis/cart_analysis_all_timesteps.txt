Here's the collision risk analysis:

**Analysis:**

* **Obstacles 20071, 20072, 20074, and 20077:** These obstacles are stationary and far from the ego vehicle, posing no immediate risk.  Risk score: 5 (Negligible Risk).

* **Obstacle 20130:** This obstacle is moving towards the ego vehicle and shows a decreasing y-coordinate over time getting closer to the ego vehicle's y-coordinate. While the x values indicate some lateral separation, the continuous motion of this obstacle towards the ego vehicle path warrants attention. There is a possibility of a collision. Risk score: 2 (High Risk) initially.

* **Obstacle 20131:** This obstacle is also moving and its y-coordinate is further away from the ego vehicle comparing to Obstacle 20130. There is still a possibility of collision, but there is more time to react or adjust than the Obstacle 20130. Therefore, it has a medium risk score. Risk score: 3 (Medium Risk).
