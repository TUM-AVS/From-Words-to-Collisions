Obstacles 20071, 20072, 20074, and 20077 are stationary and far from the ego vehicle, posing negligible risk. Obstacle 20131 is moving away from the ego vehicle and also poses negligible risk. Obstacle 20130, however, is accelerating and moving towards the ego vehicle. While not an immediate collision, the closing distance and the obstacle's acceleration suggest a high risk of collision in the near future.  The ego vehicle has a very low velocity and decelerating, meaning a collision with 20130 is increasingly likely unless evasive action is taken.
