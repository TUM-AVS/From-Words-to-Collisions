Obstacle 20130 shows a concerning trend.  Its y-coordinate is decreasing rapidly, suggesting it is moving towards the ego vehicle's lane.  While the x-coordinates indicate some lateral separation, the combination of 20130's high velocity and acceleration warrants attention. A risk level of 2 (High Risk) is assigned due to the potential for collision if the current motion trend continues.

Obstacle 20131 is also moving towards the ego vehicle, but with a slower velocity and further distance. At this point, it's classified as a Medium Risk (3). The stationary vehicles (20071, 20072, 20074, 20077) present Negligible risk due to their distance and lack of motion.
