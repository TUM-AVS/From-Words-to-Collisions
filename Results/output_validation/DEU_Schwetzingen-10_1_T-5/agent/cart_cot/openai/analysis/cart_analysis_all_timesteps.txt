**Brief Analysis for Risky Obstacles:**

- **Obstacle 20130.0:**
  The obstacle has a trajectory that intersects closely with the ego vehicleâ€™s current path. Starting from 5.4 seconds, it consistently shows an increasing speed and maintains a trajectory that reduces horizontal distance from the ego vehicle. By 6.3 seconds, the position is (-13.6811, -14.368), which places it dangerously close, with high speed and high acceleration, suggesting an impending collision.
  
- **Obstacle 20131.0:**
  The obstacle is consistently accelerating and moving closer to the ego vehicle over the observed time frame. Despite the lateral distance, the acceleration suggests a crossing trajectory with a potential for conflict if the ego vehicle were to change its lane or trajectory.

After evaluating position, velocity, and trajectory changes, it is evident that obstacle 20130.0 poses the most imminent collision chance.
