### Analysis:

1. **Obstacle 20130**:  
   - **Position**: (-13.6811, -14.368) at 6.3s, moving towards the ego vehicle.  
   - **Velocity**: 3.169 m/s (accelerating at 1.0967 m/s²).  
   - **Relative Motion**: The obstacle is moving towards the ego vehicle from the side/rear. The lateral distance is decreasing, and the longitudinal distance is closing.  
   - **TTC**: The relative velocity is high, and the distance is closing rapidly. The TTC is low, indicating imminent collision risk.  
   - **Risk**: **Extreme Risk (1)** - Collision likely and imminent due to high relative velocity and closing distance.  

2. **Obstacle 20131**:  
   - **Position**: (-10.9465, -28.549) at 6.3s, moving towards the ego vehicle.  
   - **Velocity**: 2.0596 m/s (accelerating at 0.9202 m/s²).  
   - **Relative Motion**: The obstacle is moving towards the ego vehicle but is farther away compared to 20130. The lateral distance is significant, but the longitudinal distance is closing.  
   - **TTC**: The relative velocity is lower than 20130, but the distance is still closing.  
   - **Risk**: **High Risk (2)** - Close to collision, needs urgent action but not as imminent as 20130.  

3. **Other Obstacles (20071.0, 20072.0, 20074.0, 20077.0)**:  
   - **Position**: Stationary or very far from the ego vehicle.  
   - **Velocity**: 0 m/s.  
   - **Relative Motion**: No significant movement or risk to the ego vehicle.  
   - **Risk**: **Negligible Risk (5)** - No meaningful risk.
