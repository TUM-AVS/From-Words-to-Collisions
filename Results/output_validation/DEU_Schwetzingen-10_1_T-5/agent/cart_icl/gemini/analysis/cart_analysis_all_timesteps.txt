Obstacle 20130 is showing concerning behavior. It's rapidly approaching the ego vehicle from behind with a high closing velocity.  The distance between the vehicles is decreasing, while obstacle 20130's velocity is increasing significantly over each time step. This indicates a high probability of a collision if the current trajectories continue. Precise TTC calculation is difficult without clear longitudinal and lateral velocity components, but the overall trend suggests imminent danger.
