To evaluate the risk levels in this scenario, we must analyze the positions, velocities, and trends across the timesteps for both the ego vehicle and obstacles. Here is the key analysis for each obstacle at the 6.3-second mark:

- **Ego Position and Motion:**
  At 6.3 seconds, the ego maintains a relatively slow velocity of 0.0018 m/s, with minor changes in position indicating a very gradual motion.

- **Obstacle 20071.0:**
  It's stationary at a distance of approximately 9 meters laterally from the ego (safe distance considering no relative velocity). Current risk: **5 (Negligible Risk).**

- **Obstacle 20072.0, 20074.0, 20077.0:**
  These are static installations with significant lateral distance from the ego vehicle. Current risk: **5 (Negligible Risk).**

- **Obstacle 20130.0:**
  It is moving towards the ego vehicle's path from the lateral direction with a velocity of 3.169 m/s. Given its increasing speed and direction towards ego's lane, this poses a potential risk:
  1. The relative velocity is concerning as it makes significant lateral movement across road lines.
  2. Shortening distance trends warrant caution.
  
  **Risk Level: 2 (High Risk)** due to its rapid lateral approach and significantly increased velocity.

- **Obstacle 20131.0:**
  This vehicle follows a parallel trajectory but at a safe lateral distance from the ego, with increasing velocity indicating a pass-by scenario without an intersection. Current risk: **4 (Low Risk).**

Let's now outline the JSON structure with the identified risks:

```json
{
  "CollisionObstacles": [],
  "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {},
  "HighRiskObstacle": {
    "ObstacleID": "20130.0",
    "OverallRiskScore": 2
  }
}
```

This JSON reflects that obstacle 20130.0 is identified as a high-risk obstacle due to its trajectory and velocity potentially bringing it into conflict with the ego vehicle.
