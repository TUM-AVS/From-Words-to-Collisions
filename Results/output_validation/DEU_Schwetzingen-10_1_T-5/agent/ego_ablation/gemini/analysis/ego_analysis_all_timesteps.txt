At time 6.3 seconds, the ego vehicle faces a potential collision with Obstacle 20130.

* **Obstacle 20071:**  Located 3.66m longitudinally and 1.99m laterally in the front-left.  This obstacle poses a medium risk (3) due to its proximity.  However, the provided data suggests no relative motion, and therefore no immediate collision risk.

* **Obstacle 20072:** Located 7.06m longitudinally and 8.32m laterally in the front-left.  This obstacle poses a low risk (4) with no relative motion indicated.

* **Obstacle 20074:** Located 10.22m longitudinally and 14.55m laterally in the front-left. Negligible risk (5) with no relative motion.

* **Obstacle 20077:** Located 13.35m longitudinally and 20.78m laterally in the front-left. Negligible risk (5) with no relative motion.

* **Obstacle 20130:** Located 0.00m longitudinally and 1.06m laterally to the left. This obstacle poses a **high risk (2)** due to the extremely close lateral proximity and indicated longitudinal alignment. Although the relative longitudinal velocity suggests the obstacle is moving away from the ego vehicle's longitudinal position, the small lateral distance presents an immediate concern.

* **Obstacle 20131:**  Located -11.54m longitudinally and 9.15m laterally in the rear-left. This obstacle is considered a medium to low risk (3.5).  The relative motion information shows the obstacle is moving closer both longitudinally and laterally. Due to its current distance and moderate relative speed, a collision isn't imminent.
