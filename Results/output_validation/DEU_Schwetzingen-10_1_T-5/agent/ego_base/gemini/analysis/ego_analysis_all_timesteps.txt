At timestamp 6.3 seconds, the ego vehicle is facing a potentially dangerous situation with obstacle 20130.

* **Obstacle 20071:** Located 3.66m longitudinally and 1.99m laterally in the Front-left, poses no immediate risk due to its relative static state (zero velocity and acceleration). Risk score: 5 (Negligible Risk)

* **Obstacle 20072:** Located 7.06m longitudinally and 8.32m laterally in the Front-left, poses no immediate risk due to its relative static state (zero velocity and acceleration). Risk score: 5 (Negligible Risk)

* **Obstacle 20074:** Located 10.22m longitudinally and 14.55m laterally in the Front-left, poses no immediate risk due to its relative static state (zero velocity and acceleration). Risk score: 5 (Negligible Risk)

* **Obstacle 20077:** Located 13.35m longitudinally and 20.78m laterally in the Front-left, poses no immediate risk due to its relative static state (zero velocity and acceleration). Risk score: 5 (Negligible Risk)

* **Obstacle 20130:**  Located alongside the ego vehicle (0.00m longitudinal, 1.06m lateral) and moving with a longitudinal velocity of 2.62 m/s towards the ego vehicle while simultaneously moving laterally towards the ego vehicle at a velocity of -1.78m/s. This close proximity and dynamic motion present a high risk of collision. Risk score: 2 (High Risk)

* **Obstacle 20131:** Located behind the ego vehicle (-11.54m longitudinal, 9.15m lateral) and approaching with a longitudinal velocity of 1.70m/s. The lateral velocity is -1.15m/s towards the ego car from the left. This obstacle requires attention, but the risk is lower than 20130 due to the larger longitudinal separation. Risk score: 3 (Medium Risk)


Risk Levels:
0: Collision - Physical contact occurred or unavoidable
1: Extreme Risk - Immediate collision likely
2: High Risk - Close to collision, needs quick action
3: Medium Risk - Manageable with proper reaction
4: Low Risk - Minimal risk, sufficient time to react
5: Negligible Risk - No significant risk
