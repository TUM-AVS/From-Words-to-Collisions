### Safety analysis for timestep 6.3s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

It's crucial to note that the provided scenario lacks crucial information for accurate TTC calculation.  Specifically, the relative *velocities* are consistently reported as 0 m/s or close to it, even when obstacles are getting closer. This makes reliable TTC calculation impossible.  Furthermore, the scenario uses "real distance" which needs to be adjusted according to the prompt by considering vehicle sizes (not provided). Due to the lack of size data, we cannot calculate adjusted longitudinal and lateral distances, and thus accurate MDC values are impossible. Therefore, I will make assumptions to illustrate the analysis process.

**Assumptions:**

1. **Ego Vehicle and Obstacle Size**: Assume all vehicles have a  "collision radius" of 1.5 meters. This simplifies calculations and stands in for missing vehicle dimensions.

2. **Non-Zero Velocities for Approaching Obstacles:** If an obstacle's real distance is decreasing, a small non-zero velocity will be assumed to allow for TTC calculation.

**Calculations and Analysis**

* **Obstacle 20071, 20072, 20074, and 20077**: Front-left. These obstacles have moved further away from the ego vehicle compared to previous timesteps. Real longitudinal distance is significantly greater than 1.5 meters and thus is considered safe. The risk level is negligible (5) due to the increasing distances and stationary relative velocities (or inferred small separating velocities from the context).
* **Obstacle 20130**: Left. This obstacle is listed with a 0m real longitudinal and lateral distance, implying contact. Based on the context, we'll assume this is an error and the real distance is small but non-zero. Given the context, we assume this represents contact since 0 lateral and longitudinal distance. Overall risk score is 0 (collision).  
* **Obstacle 20131**: Rear-left. Real distance is substantial (~11.54m longitudinally) and well outside the assumed collision radius. Although listed as getting closer to the ego vehicle (based on negative distance), since MDC>5 we consider this negligible risk (5).
