Let me analyze the most recent timestep (6.3 seconds) and assess collision risks for each obstacle:

1. Obstacle 20071 (Front-left):
   - Adjusted distances: longitudinal 3.66m, lateral 1.99m
   - Relative velocities: 0 m/s in both directions
   - Motion: Driving toward ego longitudinally but no relative motion
   - MDC: 1.99m (lateral is smaller)
   - TTC: N/A (no relative motion)
   - Risk: Medium (3) based on MDC

2. Obstacle 20072 (Front-left):
   - Adjusted distances: longitudinal 7.06m, lateral 8.32m
   - Relative velocities: 0 m/s in both directions
   - Motion: Driving toward ego longitudinally but no relative motion
   - MDC: 7.06m (longitudinal is smaller)
   - TTC: N/A
   - Risk: Low (4) based on MDC

3. Obstacle 20074 (Front-left):
   - Adjusted distances: longitudinal 10.22m, lateral 14.55m
   - Relative velocities: 0 m/s in both directions
   - Motion: Driving toward ego longitudinally but no relative motion
   - MDC: 10.22m
   - TTC: N/A
   - Risk: No Risk (5)

4. Obstacle 20077 (Front-left):
   - Adjusted distances: longitudinal 13.35m, lateral 20.78m
   - Relative velocities: 0 m/s in both directions
   - Motion: Driving toward ego longitudinally but no relative motion
   - MDC: 13.35m
   - TTC: N/A
   - Risk: No Risk (5)

5. Obstacle 20130 (Left):
   - Adjusted distances: longitudinal 0.00m, lateral 1.06m
   - Relative velocities: longitudinal 2.62m/s, lateral -1.78m/s
   - Motion: Exact longitudinal alignment, approaching laterally from left
   - MDC: 1.06m (lateral)
   - TTC: 1.06/1.78 = 0.6s (lateral)
   - Risk: High (2) based on TTC and MDC

6. Obstacle 20131 (Rear-left):
   - Adjusted distances: longitudinal -11.54m, lateral 9.15m
   - Relative velocities: longitudinal 1.70m/s, lateral -1.15m/s
   - Motion: Approaching from behind and left
   - MDC: 9.15m (lateral)
   - TTC: 9.15/1.15 = 8.0s (lateral)
   - Risk: Low (4) based on MDC

Trajectory Analysis:
- Obstacle 20130 shows concerning trend: lateral distance decreasing from 0m to 1.06m with increasing lateral velocity (-1.78m/s)
- Other obstacles show stable or increasing distances
- No current collisions (risk 0) but 20130 is approaching quickly from the side
