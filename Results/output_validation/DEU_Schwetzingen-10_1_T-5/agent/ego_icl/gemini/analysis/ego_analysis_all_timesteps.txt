At timestep 6.3 seconds:

* **Obstacle 20071:** Front-left, longitudinal 3.66 m, lateral 1.99 m. Relative velocity is zero in both directions.  MDC is 1.99m. Since the relative velocity is zero, TTC is not applicable. Risk level: Medium (3) due to proximity.

* **Obstacle 20072:** Front-left, longitudinal 7.06 m, lateral 8.32 m. Relative velocity is zero in both directions. MDC is 7.06m. Since the relative velocity is zero, TTC is not applicable. Risk level: Low (4) due to proximity.

* **Obstacle 20074:** Front-left, longitudinal 10.22 m, lateral 14.55 m. Relative velocity is zero in both directions. MDC is 10.22m. Since the relative velocity is zero, TTC is not applicable. Risk level: Negligible (5).

* **Obstacle 20077:** Front-left, longitudinal 13.35 m, lateral 20.78 m. Relative velocity is zero in both directions. MDC is 13.35m. Since the relative velocity is zero, TTC is not applicable. Risk level: Negligible (5).

* **Obstacle 20130:** Left, longitudinal 0.00 m, lateral 1.06 m, longitudinal relative velocity 2.62 m/s, lateral relative velocity -1.78 m/s.  MDC is 1.06m. Lateral TTC = 1.06 / |-1.78| = 0.59s. Longitudinal TTC = 0 / |2.62| = 0s, essentially meaning no longitudinal relative motion. The motion description states exact longitudinal alignment and the lateral motion toward the ego is confirmed by the raw relative velocity. Risk level: Extreme (1) due to low lateral distance and very short TTC, indicating likely side-swipe collision.

* **Obstacle 20131:** Rear-left, longitudinal -11.54 m, lateral 9.15 m, longitudinal relative velocity 1.70 m/s, lateral relative velocity -1.15 m/s. MDC is 9.15m.  Lateral TTC = 9.15 / |-1.15| = 7.96s. Longitudinal TTC = -11.54 / |1.70| = -6.79s (not applicable as already past). The obstacle is moving away laterally, though still relatively close. Risk level: Low (4) due to proximity.
