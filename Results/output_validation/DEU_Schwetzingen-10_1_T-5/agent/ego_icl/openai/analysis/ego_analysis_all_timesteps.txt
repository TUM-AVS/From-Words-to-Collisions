Let's begin the analysis based on the most recent timestep (6.3 seconds).

### Obstacle-by-Obstacle Analysis

1. **Obstacle 20071**
   - **Position**: Front-left of ego car
   - **Adjusted Distances**: Longitudinal 3.66m, Lateral 1.99m
   - **Velocities**: Relative longitudinal velocity is 0.00 m/s, lateral is 0.00 m/s.
   - **Analysis**:
     - As the obstacle has both zero relative velocities and non-zero distances, there is no immediate collision risk.
     - **MDC**: 3.66m
     - **TTC**: Not applicable due to zero relative velocity.
     - **Risk Assessment**: With an MDC of 3.66m, this obstacle falls under Medium Risk (score 3).

2. **Obstacle 20072**
   - **Position**: Front-left of ego car
   - **Adjusted Distances**: Longitudinal 7.06m, Lateral 8.32m
   - **Velocities**: Relative longitudinal velocity is 0.00 m/s, lateral is 0.00 m/s.
   - **Analysis**:
     - Neither component indicates collision likelihood.
     - **MDC**: 7.06m
     - **TTC**: Not applicable.
     - **Risk Assessment**: This obstacle is rated as Negligible Risk (score 5) due to large distances.

3. **Obstacle 20074**
   - **Position**: Front-left of ego car
   - **Adjusted Distances**: Longitudinal 10.22m, Lateral 14.55m
   - **Velocities**: Relative longitudinal velocity is 0.00 m/s, lateral is 0.00 m/s.
   - **Analysis**:
     - Zero closing velocity and large distances.
     - **MDC**: 10.22m
     - **TTC**: Not applicable.
     - **Risk Assessment**: Negligible Risk (score 5).

4. **Obstacle 20077**
   - **Position**: Front-left of ego car
   - **Adjusted Distances**: Longitudinal 13.35m, Lateral 20.78m
   - **Velocities**: Relative longitudinal velocity is 0.00 m/s, lateral is 0.00 m/s.
   - **Analysis**:
     - Zero velocities and large distances suggest no risk.
     - **MDC**: 13.35m
     - **TTC**: Not applicable.
     - **Risk Assessment**: Negligible Risk (score 5).

5. **Obstacle 20130**
   - **Position**: Left of the ego car
   - **Adjusted Distances**: Longitudinal 0.00m, Lateral 1.06m
   - **Velocities**: Relative lateral velocity is -1.78 m/s.
   - **Analysis**:
     - Very close proximity laterally and non-zero relative velocity toward the ego vehicle.
     - **MDC**: 0.00m (due to alignment and distance)
     - **TTC lateral**: â‰ˆ 1.06m / 1.78 m/s = ~0.6 seconds
     - **Risk Assessment**: High risk (score 2) due to closing distance and velocity.

6. **Obstacle 20131**
   - **Position**: Rear-left of the ego car
   - **Adjusted Distances**: Longitudinal -11.54m, Lateral 9.15m
   - **Velocities**: Relative longitudinal velocity is 1.70 m/s, lateral -1.15 m/s.
   - **Analysis**:
     - The obstacle is closing from the rear but still at a safe distance.
     - **MDC**: Not immediate
     - **TTC**: Not applicable due to significant distances.
     - **Risk Assessment**: Low Risk (score 4).

### Summary
Two obstacles require attention:  
- **Obstacle 20130** poses a High Risk with a potential lateral collision within a short timeframe due to its small lateral distance and closing velocity.
