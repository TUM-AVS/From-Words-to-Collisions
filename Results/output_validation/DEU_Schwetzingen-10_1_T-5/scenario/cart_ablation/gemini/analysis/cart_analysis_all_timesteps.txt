At timestep 6.5 seconds, the ego vehicle at (-14.6869, -9.5866) is closest to obstacle 20130 at (-13.8437, -13.5251). While obstacle 20130 is in a different lanelet (3146), its trajectory shows it rapidly approaching the ego vehicle's lanelet and current position.  Given the high velocity and acceleration of obstacle 20130 (velocity = 3.2787 and acceleration = 1.0967), combined with the ego vehicle's slow velocity (0.0016), a collision is highly likely in the next few timesteps if no evasive action is taken by either vehicle. The other obstacles are significantly further away and pose no immediate threat. Because of the high probability of collision with obstacle 20130, it is classified as an extreme risk.
