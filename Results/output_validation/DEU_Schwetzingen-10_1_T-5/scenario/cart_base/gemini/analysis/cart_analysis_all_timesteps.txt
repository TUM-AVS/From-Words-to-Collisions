At t=6.5s, the ego vehicle is at (-14.6869, -9.5866) with a near-zero velocity (0.0016).  Obstacle 20130 is at (-13.8437, -13.5251) and moving towards the ego vehicle with a substantial velocity (3.2787) and acceleration (1.0967). The y-coordinates suggest 20130 will likely cross the ego vehicle's path soon. Given the proximity and 20130's speed and acceleration, a collision is highly probable in the next few timesteps. Obstacle 20131, while further away, is also accelerating and moving towards the ego vehicle's general vicinity, presenting a potential future risk, but not as immediate as 20130.
