### Safety Analysis for the Most Recent Timestep (6.5 seconds):

#### Key Observations:
1. **Ego Vehicle**: 
   - Position: (-14.6869, -9.5866)
   - Velocity: 0.0016 (very slow)
   - Acceleration: -0.0006 (decelerating)
   - Lanelet: 11634.0

2. **Obstacle Patterns**:
   - Most obstacles are stationary (velocity = 0) or moving away from the ego vehicle.
   - The only moving obstacles (20119-20131) are either in different lanelets or moving in directions that don't intersect with the ego's path.
   - No obstacles show a trajectory that would intersect with the ego's current position or projected path.

### Obstacle Analysis (Selected Relevant Obstacles):

1. **Obstacle 20130**:
   - Position: (-13.8437, -13.5251)
   - Velocity: 3.2787 (moving towards ego's general area)
   - Distance: ~4.0 units from ego
   - **Distance Safety Score**: 4 (Low Risk - moving towards but still at safe distance)
   - **Time Safety Score**: 4 (TTC ~1.2s based on relative velocity)
   - **Overall Risk Score**: 4

2. **Obstacle 20131**:
   - Position: (-11.028, -28.1264)
   - Velocity: 2.2436 (moving away from ego)
   - **Overall Risk Score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)

3. **Obstacle 20120**:
   - Position: (30.6281, 3.804)
   - Velocity: 5.2853 (moving perpendicular to ego)
   - **Overall Risk Score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)

All other obstacles are either stationary or moving in non-intersecting paths with sufficient distance.

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. Checked all obstacles in same/different lanelets - none share ego's lanelet (11634.0)
2. Analyzed trajectories of moving obstacles - none show convergence with ego's path
3. Calculated TTC for closest moving obstacle (20130) - safe margin (>1s)
4. Verified no obstacles have risk score â‰¤1
5. Confirmed ego is nearly stationary (0.0016 velocity)
