### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 20071.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is far from the ego vehicle and stationary.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Obstacle is stationary, posing no immediate time-related risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 20072.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is far from the ego vehicle and stationary.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Obstacle is stationary, posing no immediate time-related risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 20074.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is far from the ego vehicle and stationary.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Obstacle is stationary, posing no immediate time-related risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 20077.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is far from the ego vehicle and stationary.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Obstacle is stationary, posing no immediate time-related risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 20130.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is relatively close and approaching the ego vehicle.  Over the past timestamps, the distance has decreased. Although not immediately colliding, the continuous approach raises concern.
- Distance safety score: 2
- Time Risk reason: The obstacle's velocity is significantly higher than the ego vehicle's and it is accelerating. This rapid approach indicates a high time-related risk.
- Time safety score: 2
- Overall Risk score: 2

- Obstacle ID: 20131.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is further away than 20130.0, but still approaching the ego vehicle, and the distance has been consistently decreasing.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason:  Obstacle is moving towards the ego vehicle and accelerating, but its current distance provides more time to react compared to 20130.0
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3


### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
Obstacles 20071.0, 20072.0, 20074.0, and 20077.0 are stationary and far, posing no risk. Obstacles 20130.0 and 20131.0 are approaching, with 20130.0 presenting a higher risk due to its proximity, higher velocity, and acceleration.  This is not a collision scenario yet, but 20130.0 poses a high risk.


### Summary in JSON Format:
