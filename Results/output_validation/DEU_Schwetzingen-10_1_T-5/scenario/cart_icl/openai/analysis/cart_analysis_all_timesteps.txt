### Obstacle Analysis:

#### Obstacle ID: 20071
- **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is stationary and not within immediate proximity to the ego vehicle, maintaining a constant position over time.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: As the obstacle is motionless, the risk of collision remains negligible. 
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 20072
- **Distance Risk reason**: Far from the ego vehicle with no movement over the recorded period indicates negligible risk.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: Remains stationary, no evidence of approaching the ego vehicle.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 20074
- **Distance Risk reason**: Positioned far away and stationary, which minimizes collision risk.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: No movement detected, ensuring no temporal risk is present.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 20077
- **Distance Risk reason**: Stationary and located far from the ego vehicle, thus posing no collision threat.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: As its position is constant, no temporal risk exists.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 20130
- **Distance Risk reason**: Moves with a relatively higher velocity compared to others but remains in a different lanelet, reducing collision risk.
- **Distance safety score**: 4
- **Time Risk reason**: Although moving, its trajectory suggests it will not interfere with the ego vehicle's path.
- **Time safety score**: 4
- **Overall Risk score**: 4

#### Obstacle ID: 20131
- **Distance Risk reason**: Positioned far and in another lanelet, with gradual movement away from the ego vehicle in later timesteps.
- **Distance safety score**: 4
- **Time Risk reason**: Accelerated motion, but operating on a diverging path.
- **Time safety score**: 4
- **Overall Risk score**: 4

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. Evaluate the relative positions and movements of all obstacles, focusing on their proximity and potential for intersection with the ego's path.
2. Assess each obstacle's velocity and acceleration to determine their likelihood of entering the ego vehicle's trajectory imminently.
3. Despite some dynamic movement, all obstacles remain in such positions that prevent collision with the ego.
4. Concluding that no obstacle currently poses a collision or extreme risk scenario, considering the current distancing and trend data.
