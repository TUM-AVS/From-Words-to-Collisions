### Safety analysis for timestep 5.6: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 20071
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is very close to the ego vehicle (1.19m longitudinally and laterally) in the front-left.
- Distance safety score: 1
- Time Risk reason:  The relative longitudinal and lateral velocities are zero, implying a standstill or very slow movement relative to the ego vehicle, but the obstacle is close.  Without further data points to confirm movement away, the risk remains high.
- Time safety score: 1
- Overall Risk score: 1

- Obstacle ID: 20072
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is very close to the ego vehicle (1.39m longitudinally and laterally) in the front-left.
- Distance safety score: 1
- Time Risk reason:  The relative longitudinal and lateral velocities are zero, implying a standstill or very slow movement relative to the ego vehicle. Without further data points to confirm movement away, the risk remains high.
- Time safety score: 1
- Overall Risk score: 1

- Obstacle ID: 20074
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is very close to the ego vehicle (1.44m longitudinally and laterally) in the front-left.
- Distance safety score: 1
- Time Risk reason:  The relative longitudinal and lateral velocities are zero, implying a standstill or very slow movement relative to the ego vehicle. Without further data points to confirm movement away, the risk remains high.
- Time safety score: 1
- Overall Risk score: 1

- Obstacle ID: 20077
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is very close to the ego vehicle (1.46m longitudinally and laterally) in the front-left.
- Distance safety score: 1
- Time Risk reason: The relative longitudinal and lateral velocities are zero, implying a standstill or very slow movement relative to the ego vehicle. Without further data points to confirm movement away, the risk remains high.
- Time safety score: 1
- Overall Risk score: 1

- Obstacle ID: 20130
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle approaching from behind (-2.97m longitudinally) with some lateral offset.
- Distance safety score: 2
- Time Risk reason: Closing velocity is high (2.71 m/s longitudinally). Although some deceleration is present, the closing distance suggests a high risk in the near future.
- Time safety score: 2
- Overall Risk score: 2

- Obstacle ID: 20131
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is at a safe distance behind (-15.88m longitudinally and laterally) the ego vehicle.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason:  Although moving towards the ego vehicle, the distance is sufficient for the ego vehicle to react.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4


### Safety analysis for timestep 5.7 - 6.5 (Summary):

Obstacles 20071, 20072, 20074, and 20077 remain at extreme risk (Overall Risk Score 1) from timesteps 5.6 to 5.9 due to their very close proximity and near-zero relative velocities. At timestep 6.0, their distances increase significantly, likely due to the change in the ego vehicle's position or motion that has not been explicitly described.  They continue to move away or stay at the same distance.

Obstacle 20130 poses a high risk (Overall Risk Score 2), approaching rapidly from behind the ego vehicle, starting at 5.6 and gets dangerously close by 5.8 seconds.  By 6.3 seconds, the logs indicate that the obstacle is at a zero distance and in a state of collision (0) which is confirmed for timesteps 6.4 and 6.5.

Obstacle 20131 remains at low to medium risk through the scenario. Although approaching, it maintains a sufficient distance.
