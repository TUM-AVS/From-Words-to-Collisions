Obstacle 20071: Located front-left, longitudinal 2.10m, lateral 4.39m.  Relative velocity is zero in both directions. No immediate risk, but monitor for changes in velocity. Risk score: 4 (Low Risk - due to proximity).

Obstacle 20072: Located front-left, longitudinal 3.32m, lateral 11.47m. Relative velocity is zero in both directions.  No immediate risk. Risk score: 4 (Low Risk).

Obstacle 20074: Located front-left, longitudinal 4.35m, lateral 18.37m. Relative velocity is zero in both directions. No immediate risk. Risk score: 4 (Low Risk).

Obstacle 20077: Located front-left, longitudinal 5.36m, lateral 25.28m. Relative velocity is zero in both directions. No immediate risk. Risk score: 5 (No Risk).


Obstacle 20130: Located behind, longitudinal -0.00m, lateral 0.00m. Relative velocity is 3.16 m/s longitudinally and -0.88 m/s laterally. The obstacle has collided with the ego vehicle as both longitudinal and lateral distances are zero and it had been approaching in the prior timesteps.  Risk score: 0 (Collision).

Obstacle 20131: Located rear-left, longitudinal -13.71m, lateral 3.41m. Relative velocity is 2.16 m/s longitudinally and -0.61 m/s laterally. This obstacle is approaching from behind.  Given the distances and velocities, a collision is not imminent, but requires monitoring.  Risk score: 4 (Low Risk).


Collision Scenario Identified: Yes, due to Obstacle 20130 colliding with the ego vehicle.
