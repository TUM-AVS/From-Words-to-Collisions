### Scenario Analysis at the Most Recent Timestep (6.5 seconds)

**Obstacle 20071:**
- **Position:** Front-left of the ego vehicle
- **Adjusted Distances:** Longitudinal 2.10 m, Lateral 4.39 m
- **Relative Velocity:** Longitudinal 0.00 m/s, Lateral 0.00 m/s
- **Motion:** Driving toward the ego car longitudinally, no lateral relative motion

**Analysis:**  
- **MDC:** With a longitudinal distance of 2.10 m and no closing velocity, MDC is determined by the lack of relative motion.
- **TTC:** Not applicable (relative velocity = 0).
- **Risk Score:** 5 (No risk) as there's no approach.

**Obstacle 20072:**
- **Position:** Front-left of the ego vehicle
- **Adjusted Distances:** Longitudinal 3.32 m, Lateral 11.47 m
- **Relative Velocity:** Longitudinal 0.00 m/s, Lateral 0.00 m/s
- **Motion:** Driving toward the ego car longitudinally, no lateral relative motion

**Analysis:**  
- **MDC:** Longitudinal distance is adequately safe at 3.32 m; no change expected.
- **TTC:** Not applicable due to the absence of relative motion.
- **Risk Score:** 4 (Low risk) as there's some distance cushion.

**Obstacle 20074:**
- **Position:** Front-left of the ego vehicle
- **Adjusted Distances:** Longitudinal 4.35 m, Lateral 18.37 m
- **Relative Velocity:** Longitudinal 0.00 m/s, Lateral 0.00 m/s
- **Motion:** Driving toward the ego car longitudinally, no lateral relative motion

**Analysis:**  
- **MDC:** Longitudinal proximity is acceptable and currently stable.
- **TTC:** Not applicable.
- **Risk Score:** 4 (Low risk)

---

**Obstacle 20077:**
- **Position:** Front-left of the ego vehicle
- **Adjusted Distances:** Longitudinal 5.36 m, Lateral 25.28 m
- **Relative Velocity:** Longitudinal 0.00 m/s, Lateral 0.00 m/s
- **Motion:** Driving toward the ego car longitudinally, no lateral relative motion

**Analysis:**  
- **MDC:** Well outside of critical boundaries.
- **TTC:** Not applicable.
- **Risk Score:** 5 (No risk)

---

**Obstacle 20130:**
- **Position:** Collision position with the ego vehicle
- **Adjusted Distances:** Longitudinal 0.00 m, Lateral 0.00 m
- **Relative Velocity:** Longitudinal 3.16 m/s, Lateral -0.88 m/s
- **Motion:** Exact longitudinal and lateral alignment, indicating contact

**Analysis:**  
- **MDC:** 0.0 m as the adjusted distances are both 0.0 m, indicating collision.
- **TTC:** Effectively 0 due to the already occurring collision.
- **Risk Score:** 0 (Collision detected)

---

**Obstacle 20131:**
- **Position:** Rear-left of the ego car
- **Adjusted Distances:** Longitudinal -13.71 m, Lateral 3.41 m
- **Relative Velocity:** Longitudinal 2.16 m/s, Lateral -0.61 m/s
- **Motion:** Driving toward the ego car from the rear left

**Analysis:**  
- **MDC:** Longitudinal position and motion reduce the immediate risk.
- **TTC:** With considerable distance due to remaining cushion.
- **Risk Score:** 5 (No risk)

---

### Conclusion
The scenario is classified as a collision scenario due to Obstacle 20130 being in physical contact with the ego vehicle.
