### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
    - Obstacle ID: 20071
    - Relative Direction: Front-left
    - Distance Risk Reason: DTClong is 2.10m, and DTClat is 4.39m. The obstacle was initially closer longitudinally and has recently moved slightly further away. Laterally it is sufficiently far. The trajectory shows some back and forth movement from the ego.
    - Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 3
    - Lateral Distance Safety Score: 4
    - Overall Distance Safety Score: 3.5
    - Time Risk Reason: TTClong is very high indicating no longitudinal risk, TTClat is infinite further confirming no lateral risk. This is consistent with previous timesteps.
    - Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 5
    - Lateral Time Safety Score: 5
    - Overall Time Safety Score: 5.0
    - Overall Risk Score: 4

    - Obstacle ID: 20072
    - Relative Direction: Front-left
    - Distance Risk Reason: DTClong is 3.32m, and DTClat is 11.47m. The obstacle is far away in both directions. The trajectory has shown back and forth movement from the ego.
    - Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 4
    - Lateral Distance Safety Score: 5
    - Overall Distance Safety Score: 4.5
    - Time Risk Reason: TTClong is very high indicating no longitudinal risk, TTClat is infinite further confirming no lateral risk. This is consistent with previous timesteps.
    - Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 5
    - Lateral Time Safety Score: 5
    - Overall Time Safety Score: 5.0
    - Overall Risk Score: 5

    - Overall Risk Score: 5

    - Obstacle ID: 20130
    - Relative Direction: Behind
    - Distance Risk Reason: DTClong is -1.37m (Behind the ego), DTClat is 0.0m, meaning it is directly behind.  Obstacle has been approaching longitudinally throughout the previous timesteps.
    - Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 1
    - Lateral Distance Safety Score: 0
    - Overall Distance Safety Score: 1.0
    - Time Risk Reason: TTClong is 0.48s, TTClat is 0.0s. The obstacle is very close and approaching rapidly from behind as evidenced by the decreasing TTC in prior timesteps.
    - Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 1
    - Lateral Time Safety Score: 0
    - Overall Time Safety Score: 1.0
    - Overall Risk Score: 1

    - Obstacle ID: 20131
    - Relative Direction: Rear-left
    - Distance Risk Reason: DTClong is -14.68m (Behind the ego), DTClat is 3.68m. The obstacle is far behind but relatively close laterally. The trajectory shows a complex interaction where it was approaching laterally but is now at safe distance.
    - Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 5
    - Lateral Distance Safety Score: 4
    - Overall Distance Safety Score: 4.5
    - Time Risk Reason: TTClong is 8.53s indicating no longitudinal risk, TTClat is 7.62s further confirming no immediate lateral risk although it had been approaching laterally as in the last few timesteps.
    - Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 5
    - Lateral Time Safety Score: 5
    - Overall Time Safety Score: 5
    - Overall Risk Score: 5
