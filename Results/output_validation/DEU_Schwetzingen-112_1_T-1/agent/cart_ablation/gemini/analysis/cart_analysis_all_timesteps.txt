Here's the collision risk analysis:

**Obstacle 20043:** This obstacle is moving slower than the ego vehicle and is ahead of it in the same lane.  The y-coordinates show it is moving closer to the ego vehicle's y-coordinate. However, the x coordinates show it is moving away from the ego vehicle. There is no immediate danger of collision. *Risk Score: 4*

**Obstacle 20045:** This obstacle is in a different lane (5910) than the ego vehicle (5909). While its x-coordinate suggests potential intersection with the ego vehicle's path, the different lanes indicate a safe separation. Although it has a high velocity, the lane difference mitigates the risk. *Risk Score: 4*

**Obstacle 20046:** This obstacle is behind the ego vehicle in the same lane and moving slower. Its y-coordinate is decreasing, thus moving away from the ego vehicle, further reducing the risk. *Risk Score: 5*

**Obstacle 20047:** This obstacle is significantly behind the ego vehicle and moving slower.  It poses no immediate threat.  *Risk Score: 5*

Based on the provided data, no obstacle presents a collision risk score of 0 or 1.
