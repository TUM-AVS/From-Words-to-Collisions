Here's the analysis of the provided scenario:

**Obstacle 20043:** This obstacle starts relatively close to the ego vehicle and in the same lanelet (5909). However, it moves away from the ego vehicle over the provided timesteps. Additionally, at t=3.1s, it changes to a different lanelet (14107).  Its velocity and acceleration are not indicative of an immediate collision threat. Therefore, the risk level is low (4) or negligible (5).

**Obstacle 20045:** This obstacle is in a different lanelet (5910) than the ego vehicle. While its velocity is relatively high, its trajectory does not appear to intersect with the ego vehicle's path in the near future. Thus, it presents a low (4) or negligible (5) risk.

**Obstacle 20046:** This obstacle is in the same lanelet (5909) as the ego vehicle, and initially behind it.  It is approaching the ego vehicle, as its velocity is higher. However, the distance between them remains substantial and the closing rate doesn't suggest an immediate collision.  While closer monitoring is warranted, the risk is currently assessed as medium (3).

**Obstacle 20047:** This obstacle is also in the same lanelet (5909) as the ego vehicle and significantly behind it. Its distance from the ego vehicle remains large throughout the provided timestamps, and while its velocity is higher than the ego vehicle's, the closing rate is not alarming. The risk is negligible (5).
