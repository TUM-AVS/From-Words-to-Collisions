### Analysis

1. **Obstacle 20043.0:**
   - Current position is moving away from the ego vehicle and the lanelet different at 3.3 seconds.
   - Given the distance increase and lanelet separation, the risk remains low (4 or 5).
   
2. **Obstacle 20045.0:**
   - Moving significantly faster with a velocity of 12.3074, but in a different lanelet (5910.0).
   - The trajectory does not intersect with the ego vehicle path, reducing potential collision threat. Score likely 3.

3. **Obstacle 20046.0:**
   - In the same lanelet as the ego vehicle (5909.0) and following similar orientation, it has decreased its distance from ego.
   - The decreasing distance and velocity profile suggest a Medium Risk, due to potential continued proximity: Overall Risk Score 3.

4. **Obstacle 20047.0:**
   - Also in the same lanelet but maintains a more consistent path and speed, still far from the ego's longitudinal trajectory.
   - Risk assessment indicates Medium Risk but manageable due to velocity trends: Overall Risk Score 3.

Given these risks, the focus shifts primarily to obstacle 20046.0 which, despite not being the highest risk in terms of immediate collision, presents the highest medium risk factor due to its proximity and slightly converging path with the ego vehicle:
