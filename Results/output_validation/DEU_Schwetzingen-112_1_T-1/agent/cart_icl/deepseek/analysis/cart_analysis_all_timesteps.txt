### Analysis of Risky Obstacles:

1. **Obstacle 20043.0**:
   - **Position**: (-4.0667, -4.9378) at 3.3s, moving towards the ego vehicle.
   - **Relative Motion**: The obstacle is in the same lanelet (14107.0) as the ego vehicle (5909.0) at earlier timesteps but changes lanelet at 3.1s. The lateral distance is significant, and the obstacle is decelerating.
   - **TTC**: Not immediately critical due to lateral separation.
   - **Risk**: **Medium Risk (3)**.

2. **Obstacle 20045.0**:
   - **Position**: (-15.5191, -16.387) at 3.3s, moving away from the ego vehicle.
   - **Relative Motion**: The obstacle is in a different lanelet (5910.0) and is moving away from the ego vehicle with high velocity.
   - **TTC**: Not applicable as the obstacle is moving away.
   - **Risk**: **Negligible Risk (5)**.

3. **Obstacle 20046.0**:
   - **Position**: (-11.9017, -21.6838) at 3.3s, moving towards the ego vehicle.
   - **Relative Motion**: The obstacle is in the same lanelet (5909.0) as the ego vehicle and is closing in from behind.
   - **TTC**: The distance is decreasing, but the relative velocity is not extremely high.
   - **Risk**: **High Risk (2)**.

4. **Obstacle 20047.0**:
   - **Position**: (-13.77, -41.3049) at 3.3s, moving away from the ego vehicle.
   - **Relative Motion**: The obstacle is in the same lanelet (5909.0) but is far behind the ego vehicle and moving away.
   - **TTC**: Not applicable as the obstacle is moving away.
   - **Risk**: **Negligible Risk (5)**.
