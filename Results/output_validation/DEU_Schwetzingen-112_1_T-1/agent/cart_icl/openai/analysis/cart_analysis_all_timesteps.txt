To evaluate this scenario, I'll start by analyzing the latest timestep (3.3s) and using previous steps to understand motion trends.

**Ego Vehicle (20044.0):**
- At position (-12.0069, -16.9197) in lanelet 5909.0.
- Orientation and velocity have been fairly consistent, with a slight decline in velocity over time.

**Obstacle Analysis:**

1. **Obstacle 20043.0:**
   - Position: (-4.0667, -4.9378) in lanelet 14107.0.
   - Relatively far laterally and has changed lanelet indicating it is moving away from the ego's path.
   - Velocity is decreasing steadily.

2. **Obstacle 20045.0:**
   - Position: (-15.5191, -16.387) in lanelet 5910.0.
   - Significant longitudinal distance from the ego.
   - High constant velocity but in a different lanelet (5910.0).

3. **Obstacle 20046.0:**
   - Position: (-11.9017, -21.6838) in lanelet 5909.0.
   - On the same lanelet, velocity is decreasing but still significantly away.
   - Longitudinal distance is decreasing but not critical as the TTC remains manageable.

4. **Obstacle 20047.0:**
   - Position: (-13.77, -41.3049) in lanelet 5909.0.
   - Same lanelet, significant distance behind, and declining velocity.
   - Not a current threat due to longitudinal positioning.

**TTC and MDC Incorporation:**
- The TTC and MDC analysis indicates all obstacles are maintaining or increasing the distance relative to the ego vehicle, with no meaningful projection of crossing paths in a dangerous manner.

**Risk Scores Calculation:**
- **Obstacle 20043.0** transitioned to a different lanelet, reducing its risk.
- **Obstacle 20045.0** is not closely approaching nor in the same lanelet.
- **Obstacle 20046.0** and **20047.0** pose a smaller threat due to their positions and velocity profiles.

Given this analysis, none of the obstacles immediately meet the conditions for a collision or extreme risk in this timestep based on the data provided.
