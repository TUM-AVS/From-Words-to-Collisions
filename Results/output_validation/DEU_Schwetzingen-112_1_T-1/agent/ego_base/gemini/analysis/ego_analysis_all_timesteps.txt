At t=3.3s:
- **Obstacle 20043**: Located front-right, moving slightly towards the ego vehicle longitudinally and away laterally.  Poses no immediate threat. Risk score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- **Obstacle 20045**: Located to the left of the ego vehicle, almost parallel longitudinally. It is very close laterally (1.9m) and its lateral relative velocity indicates it is moving towards the ego vehicle. This represents a potential collision risk in the near future if the ego vehicle moves laterally left. Risk score: 2 (High Risk)
- **Obstacle 20046**: Located behind and very close to the ego vehicle longitudinally (-0.26m). It is moving towards the ego vehicle and likely to collide very soon. Risk score: 1 (Extreme Risk)
- **Obstacle 20047**: Located rear-left, moving towards the ego vehicle both longitudinally and laterally. However, it is still relatively far. Risk score: 4 (Low Risk)


Risk Levels:
0: Collision - Physical contact occurred or unavoidable
1: Extreme Risk - Immediate collision likely
2: High Risk - Close to collision, needs quick action
3: Medium Risk - Manageable with proper reaction
4: Low Risk - Minimal risk, sufficient time to react
5: Negligible Risk - No significant risk
