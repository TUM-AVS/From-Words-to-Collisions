### Safety analysis for timestep 3.3s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

**- Obstacle ID: 20043**
- Distance Risk reason: Located 7.44m longitudinally and 7.44m laterally in the front-right of the ego vehicle, posing no immediate threat.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Moving away from the ego vehicle both longitudinally and laterally.  TTC is irrelevant as the risk is negligible given the current motion.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

**- Obstacle ID: 20045**
- Distance Risk reason: Situated at 0m longitudinal and 0m lateral distance. This suggests a collision, or that the obstacle's bounding box significantly overlaps with the ego vehicle.
- Distance safety score: 0
- Time Risk reason: Given the zero distance, TTC is effectively zero, indicating a collision.
- Time safety score: 0
- Overall Risk score: 0

**- Obstacle ID: 20046**
- Distance Risk reason: At -0.26m longitudinally, this obstacle is extremely close to the rear of the ego vehicle, indicating a likely collision.  The lateral distance of -0.26m indicates a substantial overlap.
- Distance safety score: 1
- Time Risk reason: The small longitudinal distance and relative longitudinal velocity suggest a very imminent collision.
- Time safety score: 1
- Overall Risk score: 1

**- Obstacle ID: 20047**
- Distance Risk reason: Located -19.87m longitudinally and -19.87m laterally behind and to the left of the ego vehicle, posing no immediate risk.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: While this obstacle is moving closer to the ego vehicle, the substantial distances and relative velocities suggest adequate time to react.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5
