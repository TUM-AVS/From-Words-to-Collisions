Obstacle 20043: Located front-right and moving away from the ego vehicle both longitudinally and laterally.  The distances are increasing over the provided timestamps, indicating no immediate risk. Risk level: 5 (Negligible Risk)

Obstacle 20045: Located to the left of the ego vehicle.  While it was initially approaching the ego vehicle longitudinally, it is now at 0.00m longitudinal distance, indicating alignment in that dimension. The lateral distance is 1.90m and slightly decreasing. The key here is that it is also moving towards the ego laterally with a closing velocity of 0.23m/s.  This lateral movement needs closer attention. Assuming constant velocity, TTC laterally is approximately 8.26 seconds, but the continuous decrease in lateral distance suggests a possible future risk.  Given the lateral movement and small lateral distance, we classify this as a medium risk. Risk level: 3 (Medium Risk)

Obstacle 20046: Located behind the ego vehicle and rapidly approaching. The longitudinal distance is only -0.26m and decreasing.  While there is still a small gap, given the decreasing longitudinal distance between the ego and the obstacle, this is a high-risk situation. Assuming a constant relative velocity, TTC is about  0.08 seconds. Risk level: 1 (Extreme Risk)

Obstacle 20047:  Located rear-left. Longitudinal distance is -19.87m, and lateral distance is decreasing, but greater than 5 meters. While both distances are closing, the high magnitude of the longitudinal distance indicates low risk. Risk level: 4 (Low Risk)
