### Obstacle-by-Obstacle Analysis

#### Obstacle 20043 (Rear-right):
- **Position & Movement**: The adjusted longitudinal distance is approximately 7.44m, and the lateral distance is -6.38m. The motion description indicates that this obstacle is moving away laterally to the right while driving toward the ego car longitudinally.
- **Trajectory Analysis**: Over time, the obstacle's lateral distance is increasing, suggesting it is moving away to the right. The longitudinal velocity is minorly negative even though the motion description points it as moving towards, indicating a stable longitudinal separation.
- **TTC & MDC Analysis**:
  - **TTC (Longitudinal)**: Given the very small relative longitudinal velocity, TTC isn't a direct risk concern.
  - **TTC (Lateral)**: Not applicable as the lateral distance increases.
  - **MDC**: This should remain stable given the obstacle's trajectory and velocities.
- **Risk Assessment**: Given the stable longitudinal separation and increasing lateral distance, the obstacle presents a **Negligible Risk (5)**.

#### Obstacle 20045 (Left):
- **Position & Movement**: The adjusted longitudinal distance is 0.00m, and the lateral distance is 1.90m. The motion indicated the obstacle is aligned in the longitudinal direction and moving laterally towards the left away.
- **Trajectory Analysis**: The obstacle is closely aligned with the ego vehicle laterally, but moving away in that direction.
- **TTC & MDC Analysis**:
  - **TTC (Longitudinal)**: Not applicable given the direct alignment and moving laterally.
  - **TTC (Lateral)**: Positive but increases as it moves away laterally.
  - **MDC**: The separation laterally excludes imminent risk.
- **Risk Assessment**: The directional movement away and separation laterally result in a **Low Risk (4)**.

#### Obstacle 20046 (Behind):
- **Position & Movement**: The adjusted longitudinal distance is -0.26m, and the lateral distance is 0.00m. The obstacle is precisely aligned both longitudinally and laterally.
- **Trajectory Analysis**: The longitudinal and lateral proximity indicates potential high risk as it has been approaching the ego vehicle consistently.
- **TTC & MDC Analysis**:
  - **TTC (Longitudinal)**: Approximately 0.26 / 3.32 â‰ˆ 0.08 seconds which is below the Extreme threshold.
  - **MDC**: Essentially an imminent risk as it approaches from behind.
- **Risk Assessment**: With very close alignment, this obstacle presents an **Extreme Risk (1)**.

#### Obstacle 20047 (Rear-left):
- **Position & Movement**: The adjusted longitudinal distance is -19.87m, and the lateral distance is 0.25m. The obstacle is closing in from the rear left.
- **Trajectory Analysis**: The obstacle's trajectory is converging on the ego vehicle from the rear left with ongoing acceleration trends.
- **TTC & MDC Analysis**:
  - **TTC**: Negative, due to drifting apart with the negating velocities.
  - **MDC**: Projected paths do not imminently intersect.
- **Risk Assessment**: Given the large separation and lateral motion away, the risk is medium but manageable. Therefore **Medium Risk (3)**.

In this analysis, Obstacle 20046 from behind presents an Extreme Risk due to minimal longitudinal distance and converging trajectory, representing the most urgent scenario. Obstacle 20047 is medium risk following due course but with slower approach, while others have lower or negligible risks due to distancing or non-threatening motion contexts.
