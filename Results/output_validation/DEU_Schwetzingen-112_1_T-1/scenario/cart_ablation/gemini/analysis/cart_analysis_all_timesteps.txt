At t=3.5s, Ego is at (-12.0074, -16.7281) in lanelet 5909. Let's analyze the risk posed by each obstacle at this timestep:

- **Obstacle 20043:** Located at (-3.947, -4.867) in lanelet 14107.  This obstacle is in a different lanelet and poses no immediate risk.

- **Obstacle 20045:** Located at (-15.4603, -18.925) in lanelet 5910. This obstacle is in a different lanelet. Although the y-coordinates are close, the trajectories suggest diverging paths, thus posing no immediate risk.

- **Obstacle 20046:** Located at (-11.9202, -20.8629) in the same lanelet 5909.  The x-coordinates are very close. Obstacle 20046 is behind Ego, but the y-coordinate difference is decreasing over subsequent timesteps. Given the velocities, a risk of collision exists if Ego decelerates or Obstacle 20046 maintains its current velocity.  Therefore, this poses a high risk.

- **Obstacle 20047:** Located at (-13.6352, -40.0688) in the same lanelet 5909. This obstacle is significantly behind Ego and poses no immediate risk.
