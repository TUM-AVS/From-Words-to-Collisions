At t=3.5s, Ego is in lanelet 5909.

* **Obstacle 20043**:  Located in lanelet 14107.  While its x-position is approaching Ego's, the lanelet change suggests a diverging trajectory, thus low risk.

* **Obstacle 20045**: Located in lanelet 5910. This obstacle is in a different lanelet and moving away from the ego vehicle, posing no immediate risk.

* **Obstacle 20046**: Located in lanelet 5909. This obstacle is behind the ego vehicle and decelerating significantly. While in the same lane, the distance and velocity difference suggest low risk in the immediate future.

* **Obstacle 20047**: Located in lanelet 5909. This obstacle is significantly behind the ego vehicle and decelerating. It poses no immediate risk.
