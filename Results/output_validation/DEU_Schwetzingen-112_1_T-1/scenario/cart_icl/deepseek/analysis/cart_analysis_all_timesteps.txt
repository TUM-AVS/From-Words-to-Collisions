### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. **Ego Vehicle**: Moving slowly (~0.96 m/s) with minimal acceleration. Position is stable.
2. **Obstacle 20046.0**: Closest threat with decreasing distance (~4.2m) and moderate velocity. High risk but not imminent collision.
3. **Other Obstacles**: Either moving away or at safe distances.
4. **Conclusion**: No immediate collision risk. Highest risk is from Obstacle 20046.0 (High Risk).
