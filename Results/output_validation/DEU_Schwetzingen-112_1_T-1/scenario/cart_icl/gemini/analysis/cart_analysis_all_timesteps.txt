### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 20043.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is in a different lane and moving away from ego.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason:  Relative velocities and accelerations indicate no immediate risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 20045.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is in a different lane and moving away from ego.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Relative velocities and accelerations indicate no immediate risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 20046.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is behind the ego vehicle and moving slower.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Relative velocities and accelerations indicate low risk, but monitoring needed.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- Obstacle ID: 20047.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is significantly behind the ego vehicle.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason:  No immediate risk due to distance and relative velocity.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5


### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
This is not a collision scenario. No obstacle presents an immediate risk of collision with the ego vehicle. All obstacles are either in different lanes, moving away, or sufficiently far behind the ego vehicle.
