### Obstacle Analysis:
#### Obstacle ID: 20043
- **Distance Risk Reason**: The obstacle is in an adjacent lanelet to the ego vehicle with no significant approach pattern over time.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 5
- **Time Risk Reason**: The obstacle is reducing its velocity and moved to a different lanelet, minimizing collision risk.
- **Time Safety Score**: 5
- **Overall Risk Score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 20045
- **Distance Risk Reason**: The obstacle is moving within its lanelet, 5910.0, which is different from the ego vehicle's. The trajectory shows a consistent path without convergence towards the ego vehicle.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 5
- **Time Risk Reason**: This obstacle maintains a high velocity in consistent orientation and is on a stable trajectory away from the ego vehicle's path.
- **Time Safety Score**: 5
- **Overall Risk Score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 20046
- **Distance Risk Reason**: This obstacle is in the same lanelet as the ego at 5909.0 and moving on a parallel but non-converging trajectory.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 4
- **Time Risk Reason**: Moderate decrease in velocity over time with a consistent path parallel but not intersecting the ego's predicted path.
- **Time Safety Score**: 4
- **Overall Risk Score**: 4

#### Obstacle ID: 20047
- **Distance Risk Reason**: The obstacle remains far away enough with a steady trajectory not converging towards the ego vehicle.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 5
- **Time Risk Reason**: The obstacle is decelerating steadily and remains in line with a far distance within the lanelet.
- **Time Safety Score**: 5
- **Overall Risk Score**: 5

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. **Position Analysis**: Ego is in lanelet 5909.0 and maintains a steady position with negligible velocity changes. The obstacles are mostly in other lanelets or moving parallel without intersection.
2. **Velocity and Acceleration Patterns**: Across timesteps, velocities and accelerations for most obstacles show deceleration or stable acceleration without collision convergence.
3. **Trajectory Evaluation**: Historical movements of obstacles show no approach or convergence patterns that pose a collision risk.

Conclusively, the analysis reveals no immediate risks since obstacles are on different pathways or stable trajectories away from intersecting with the ego vehicle.
