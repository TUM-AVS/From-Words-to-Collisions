Obstacle 20046 is in collision with the ego vehicle as indicated by a longitudinal and lateral distance of 0.0m. Obstacle 20045 is at extreme risk given its longitudinal distance of 0 meters, though it has a lateral distance of 1.85 meters which suggests it might just be alongside the ego vehicle.  Obstacle 20047 and Obstacle 20043 pose no immediate threat.

    "Reasoning": "Obstacle 20046 is in direct collision with the ego vehicle at timestep 3.5 seconds, confirmed by the longitudinal and lateral distance being zero. While Obstacle 20045 shows a longitudinal distance of 0m, suggesting alignment with the ego car, it maintains a lateral distance of 1.85m. This positioning could indicate a near miss or driving parallel to the ego car, classifying it as an extreme risk but not a collision.  Other obstacles have sufficient distance and do not pose immediate risk."
