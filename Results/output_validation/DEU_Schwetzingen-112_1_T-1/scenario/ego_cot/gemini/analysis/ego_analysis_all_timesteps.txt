### Safety analysis for timestep 2.6s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 20043
- Distance Risk reason: Located 7.59m longitudinally and laterally in the front-right, posing no immediate threat. Motion suggests increasing distance.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Moving away from the ego vehicle both longitudinally and laterally.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 20045
- Distance Risk reason: At 5.09m longitudinally and laterally in front, presenting a potential hazard.  Closing velocity is significant.
- Distance safety score: 2
- Time Risk reason: Approaching rapidly longitudinally (TTC < 0.5s based on 5.09m / 11.23m/s). Lateral motion unclear but distance is concerning.
- Time safety score: 1
- Overall Risk score: 1

- Obstacle ID: 20046
- Distance Risk reason: Very close behind (-2.99m longitudinally and laterally), indicating high risk of collision.
- Distance safety score: 1
- Time Risk reason: Closing longitudinally, increasing collision risk. Lateral motion uncertain.
- Time safety score: 1
- Overall Risk score: 1

- Obstacle ID: 20047
- Distance Risk reason: Relatively far behind (-23.97m longitudinally and laterally), posing no immediate danger.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Closing from behind but distance provides a buffer. Lateral motion also closing but not immediately concerning.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4


### Safety analysis for timestep 2.7s - 3.3s:
(Similar analysis as 2.6s, with progressively increasing risk for Obstacles 20045 and 20046 as distances decrease. Obstacle 20043 remains safe, and Obstacle 20047 remains low risk but needs monitoring.)

### Safety analysis for timestep 3.4s:
(Similar analysis as before, except:)
- Obstacle ID: 20046
- Distance Risk reason: Collision imminent (0m longitudinal and lateral).
- Distance safety score: 0
- Time Risk reason: Collision has occurred.
- Time safety score: 0
- Overall Risk score: 0


### Safety analysis for timestep 3.5s:
(Similar to 3.4s, collision with 20046 has already happened)


### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
  "CollisionObstacle": {
    "ObstacleID": "20046",
    "OverallRiskScore": "0"
  },
  "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {
    "ObstacleID": "20045",
    "OverallRiskScore": "1"
  },
    "IsCollisionScenario": true,
    "Justification": "Obstacle 20046 shows 0 distance in both longitudinal and lateral directions at timestamp 3.4, indicating a collision."
}
```
```
Key changes throughout the scenario:

* **Obstacle 20043:** Consistently low risk.
* **Obstacle 20045:** Initially high risk, transitions to extreme risk as it approaches a near-collision. Its lateral motion slightly mitigates the risk, but the longitudinal velocity is the primary concern.
* **Obstacle 20046:** High risk from the beginning and ultimately collides with the ego vehicle.
* **Obstacle 20047:** Remains a low risk throughout the scenario. The large initial distance provides a sufficient buffer, even though it's closing in.

The most crucial aspect is the rapid decrease in distance for obstacles 20045 and 20046, coupled with their concerning relative velocities. This necessitates immediate evasive maneuvers by the ego vehicle.
