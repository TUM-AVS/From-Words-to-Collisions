Let me analyze each obstacle at the most recent timestep (3.5 seconds) and determine collision risks:

1. Obstacle 20043 (Front-right):
   - Adjusted distances not provided, using raw distances (long: 7.34m, lat: -6.48m)
   - Moving away laterally (1.35 m/s away)
   - Slowly approaching longitudinally (0.16 m/s toward)
   - MDC: Lateral distance is large (6.48m) and increasing → No Risk (5)
   - TTC: Not applicable since paths are diverging → No Risk (5)
   - Overall Risk: 5 (No Risk)

2. Obstacle 20045 (Left):
   - Exact longitudinal alignment (0.00m)
   - Lateral distance: 1.85m and decreasing slightly (0.26 m/s toward)
   - MDC: 1.85m (Low Risk - 4)
   - TTC: 1.85/0.26 ≈ 7.1s (>5s) → No Risk (5)
   - Overall Risk: 4 (Low Risk)

3. Obstacle 20046 (Collision):
   - Exact alignment in both dimensions (0.00m, 0.00m)
   - Still showing relative velocity (2.98 m/s longitudinally)
   - This indicates a collision is occurring (Risk 0)
   - Trajectory shows it was approaching from behind and has now made contact

4. Obstacle 20047 (Rear-left):
   - Longitudinal: -18.83m (far behind)
   - Lateral: 0.07m and decreasing (0.67 m/s toward)
   - MDC: 0.07m (Extreme Risk - 1)
   - However, longitudinal distance is large and increasing (5.05 m/s away)
   - No actual collision path → Overall Risk: 5 (No Risk)
