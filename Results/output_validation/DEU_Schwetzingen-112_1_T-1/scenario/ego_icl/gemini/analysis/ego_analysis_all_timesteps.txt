* **Obstacle 20043 (Front-Right):**  This obstacle has been consistently moving away from the ego vehicle both longitudinally and laterally across all timesteps. At the last timestep (3.5s), it is 7.34m longitudinally and -6.48m laterally away.  The lateral movement is slightly towards the ego vehicle, but the overall distance is increasing. TTC and MDC calculations are not relevant here due to diverging trajectories.
    * Risk Score: 5 (No Risk)

* **Obstacle 20045 (Left):** This obstacle maintains near-zero longitudinal distance, indicating it's driving alongside the ego vehicle.  It's important to note that "Exact longitudinal alignment" doesn't automatically mean collision. However, at 3.5s, the lateral distance is only 1.85m and although decreasing, the small lateral velocity of -0.26 m/s indicates a slow closing speed. TTC_lateral = distance/relative_velocity_lateral = 1.85 m/0.26 m/s = 7.12s (approximate, using absolute value of velocity for time).  This suggests a relatively low lateral collision risk, and with minimal longitudinal movement, it is assumed the lateral MDC is equal to this distance.
    * Risk Score: 4 (Low Risk)

* **Obstacle 20046 (Collision):** This obstacle has been consistently approaching the ego vehicle from behind, with longitudinal distance decreasing across all timesteps. At 3.4 seconds, it is registered as "in collision". At 3.5 seconds it still maintains raw values of 0.00 m for both longitudinal and lateral distance meaning they are very close. Given the history and motion descriptions, this confirms a collision has occurred. 
    * Risk Score: 0 (Collision)

* **Obstacle 20047 (Rear-Left):**  This obstacle is approaching from behind and slightly to the left. While it's still relatively far at the last timestep (18.83m longitudinally, 0.07 m laterally), it's closing in. Given the consistent approach across timesteps, the relative velocity calculation should be carried out to determine the risk. The longitudinal closing speed is 5.05m/s and is of more concern. However, at 3.5 seconds, there appears to be an alignment of the vehicles. TTC = 18.83 / 5.05 â‰ˆ 3.73 s. Due to the small lateral distance, the MDC will be minimal.
    * Risk Score: 3 (Medium Risk), but requires close monitoring due to converging trajectories.

**Collision Scenario Determination:** Yes, this is a collision scenario because Obstacle 20046 has a risk score of 0, indicating a collision.
