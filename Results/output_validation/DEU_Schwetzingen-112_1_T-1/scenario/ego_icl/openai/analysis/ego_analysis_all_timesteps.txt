### Obstacle Analysis

#### Obstacle 20043:
- **Relative Position**: Front-right
- **Distances at 3.5s (Adjusted)**: Longitudinal 7.34m, Lateral -6.48m
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal -0.16 m/s, Lateral -1.35 m/s
- **Trajectory Description**: Driving toward the ego vehicle longitudinally, moving away laterally to the right.
- **TTC Calculation**:
  - Longitudinally: Approaching slowly, but with a very large distance and negative velocity, so no immediate threat.
  - Laterally moving away: Non-threatening as the lateral distance is increasing.
- **MDC & Risk**: 
  - MDC > 5m. 
  - Minimal change longitudinally, with lateral increase, indicating the obstacle is moving away laterally. 
  - **Risk Score**: 5 (No Risk)

#### Obstacle 20045:
- **Relative Position**: Left
- **Distances at 3.5s (Adjusted)**: Longitudinal 0.00m, Lateral 1.85m
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal -13.37 m/s, Lateral -0.26 m/s
- **Trajectory Description**: Exact longitudinal alignment, moving laterally toward the ego vehicle.
- **TTC Calculation**:
  - Longitudinally: Possible issue if MDC approaches zero and velocity negative, but the lateral distance is widening.
  - Laterally: Movement is minimal, indicating little risk.
- **MDC & Risk**:
  - Lateral alignment but with positive increasing distance.
  - **Risk Score**: 3 (Medium Risk - moving towards without alarming speed)

#### Obstacle 20046:
- **Relative Position**: Collision (exact zero in both dimensions)
- **Distances at 3.5s (Adjusted)**: Longitudinal 0.00m, Lateral 0.00m
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal 2.98 m/s, Lateral 0.08 m/s
- **Trajectory Description**: Exact alignment in both directions; theoretically a collision if zero persists without velocity separation.
- **TTC Calculation**:
  - Velocity towards, indicating an ongoing collision.
  - **Risk Score**: 0 (Collision occurring due to zero distance and converging trajectory)

#### Obstacle 20047:
- **Relative Position**: Rear-left
- **Distances at 3.5s (Adjusted)**: Longitudinal -18.83m, Lateral 0.07m
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal 5.05 m/s, Lateral -0.67 m/s
- **Trajectory Description**: Driving toward from behind, heading left.
- **TTC Calculation**:
  - Longitudinal: Far distance, although closing less alarming.
  - Lateral: Alignment risk low but getting closer.
- **MDC & Risk**: 
  - Even with longitudinal closure, significant time/distance mean no immediate danger.
  - **Risk Score**: 4 (Low Risk)

### Collision Scenario Determination
Given the analysis, particularly focusing on obstacle 20046 at the most recent timestep (3.5 seconds), a collision scenario is indicated. Its trajectory, adjusted distance, and velocity show exact alignment indicating a collision. This situation contributes a sufficient basis for identifying this as a collision scenario.
