### Obstacle Analysis:
                    - Obstacle ID: 20043
                    - Relative Direction: Front-right
                    - Distance Risk Reason: DTClong is 7.34m and DTClat is -6.48m. The obstacle has consistently been in the front-right quadrant, moving slightly closer longitudinally but further away laterally over the past few timesteps.  
                    - Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 5
                    - Lateral Distance Safety Score: 5
                    - Overall Distance Safety Score: 5
                    - Time Risk Reason: TTClong is 45.69s and TTClat is inf. While initially appearing to move away, the obstacle has shown a slow longitudinal approach in recent timesteps, though still at a very safe distance/time.  Lateral motion is away from the ego vehicle.
                    - Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 5
                    - Lateral Time Safety Score: 5
                    - Overall Time Safety Score: 5
                    - Overall Risk Score: 5

                    - Obstacle ID: 20045
                    - Relative Direction: Left
                    - Distance Risk Reason: DTClong is 0.00m and DTClat is 1.85m.  This obstacle has moved from front-left to directly left and is now longitudinally aligned with the ego vehicle.  The lateral distance is small.
                    - Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 0
                    - Lateral Distance Safety Score: 3
                    - Overall Distance Safety Score: 3
                    - Time Risk Reason: TTClong is 0.00s, indicating a collision risk longitudinally. TTClat is 7.05s, giving a moderate lateral safety margin. The trend over the past few timesteps shows this obstacle moving closer both longitudinally and laterally.
                    - Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 0
                    - Lateral Time Safety Score: 5
                    - Overall Time Safety Score: 5
                    - Overall Risk Score: 4

                    - Obstacle ID: 20046
                    - Relative Direction: Behind
                    - Distance Risk Reason: DTClong is 0.00m and DTClat is 0.00m, indicating a collision.  This obstacle has been approaching longitudinally from behind and is now at the same position as the ego vehicle.
                    - Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 0
                    - Lateral Distance Safety Score: 0
                    - Overall Distance Safety Score: 0
                    - Time Risk Reason:  TTClong is 0.00s and TTClat is 0.00s confirming the collision already detected via distance metrics. The consistent approach over prior timesteps clearly indicated this risk.
                    - Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 0
                    - Lateral Time Safety Score: 0
                    - Overall Time Safety Score: 0
                    - Overall Risk Score: 0

                    - Obstacle ID: 20047
                    - Relative Direction: Rear-left
                    - Distance Risk Reason: DTClong is -18.83m and DTClat is 0.07m. Although at a safe longitudinal distance behind the ego, this obstacle is very close laterally and approaching.  
                    - Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 5
                    - Lateral Distance Safety Score: 1
                    - Overall Distance Safety Score: 3
                    - Time Risk Reason: TTClong is 3.73s which is a moderate time to collision from behind.  TTClat is 0.10s, indicating very high lateral risk.  The obstacle has been consistently approaching both longitudinally and laterally.
                    - Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 4
                    - Lateral Time Safety Score: 1
                    - Overall Time Safety Score: 3
                    - Overall Risk Score: 3
