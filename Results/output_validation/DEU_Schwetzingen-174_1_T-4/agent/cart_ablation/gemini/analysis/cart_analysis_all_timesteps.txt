Here's the analysis of the provided scenario:

**Obstacle 20111:** This obstacle is consistently behind the ego vehicle and moving faster.  The distance between the two is decreasing over each timestep. Although a collision hasn't happened yet, the continuous approach and speed difference makes this obstacle a high risk.  If this trend continues, a collision is increasingly likely in the near future. Hence, I classify this as a **High Risk (2)** currently, with high potential for becoming an extreme risk (1) very soon.

**Obstacle 20112:** This obstacle appears at t=2.8s and is significantly further behind the ego vehicle than 20111. Though it's moving forward, the current trajectory and distance suggest that it does not pose an immediate threat. Therefore, it's classified as a **Medium Risk (3)** due to its presence in the same lane and its forward movement.
