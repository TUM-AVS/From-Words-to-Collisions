Obstacle 20111 is initially located behind the ego vehicle but is approaching rapidly due to its significantly higher velocity (10.9352 vs 4.7088 initially).  Over the time steps, the distance between the two vehicles decreases. While the obstacle's acceleration fluctuates slightly, its velocity remains much higher than the ego vehicle's. The closing velocity and proximity suggest a high risk of collision if both vehicles maintain their current trajectories and velocities. Obstacle 20112 enters the scenario later and is farther away from the ego vehicle, posing less immediate risk.
