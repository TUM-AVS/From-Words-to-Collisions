Obstacle 20111 is showing a concerning trend.  While not immediately colliding, its continuous acceleration in the same lane as the ego vehicle, combined with the ego vehicle's deceleration, points to a high probability of collision in the near future. The distance between them is decreasing over each timestep. This warrants a high-risk assessment.

Obstacle 20112, while further away, also poses some concern. It is also in the same lane and moving at a substantial speed, requiring monitoring. However, it is currently far enough away to be deemed a lower risk than 20111.
