### Analysis

At the most recent timestep (3.4 seconds), the Ego vehicle and both obstacles (20111.0 and 20112.0) are traveling on the same lanelet (2510.0). The positions of these vehicles suggest that both obstacles are ahead of the Ego vehicle.

**Obstacle 20111.0**:  
- Position: (-43.535, -99.9021)  
- Velocity is greater than that of the Ego vehicle and is closing the gap, but partly offset due to the forward leading position.
- The velocity increase over time and TTC calculation suggest proactive measures could mitigate potential risk.
- Risk Level: 3 (Medium Risk)

**Obstacle 20112.0**:  
- Position: (-28.2112, -114.4926)  
- This obstacle is significantly ahead in the lane, further reinforced by slow velocity relative to the position.
- The trajectory doesn't intersect imminently with Ego's path.
- Risk Level: 5 (Negligible Risk)

Considering the TTC and MDC over the 10 timesteps, no obstacles have an **Overall Risk Score** of 0 or 1, given the current trajectory and velocity pattern.
