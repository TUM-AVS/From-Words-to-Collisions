At timestep 3.4s, obstacle 20111 is the closest to the ego vehicle. It's rapidly approaching from behind, evidenced by the decreasing longitudinal distance between the vehicles over the past few timesteps. Although the lateral distance isn't provided, both vehicles are in the same lanelet (2510), suggesting a potential lane change or overtaking maneuver by the obstacle, warranting a higher risk assessment.  Obstacle 20112, while further away longitudinally, is also in the same lanelet and closing in on the ego vehicle.
