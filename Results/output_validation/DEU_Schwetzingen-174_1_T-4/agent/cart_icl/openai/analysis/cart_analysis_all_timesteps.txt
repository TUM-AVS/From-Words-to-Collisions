To analyze this scenario at the final timestep (3.4 seconds), we focus on the relative dynamics between the ego vehicle and obstacles 20111.0 and 20112.0.

1. **Obstacle 20111.0**:
   - **Position at 3.4s**: (-43.5350, -99.9021)
   - **Relative position to Ego (3.4s)**: 
     - Longitudinal (x-direction): 47.1361 - 43.5350 = 3.6011 (obstacle slightly behind) 
     - Lateral (y-direction): 95.6347 - 99.9021 = -4.2674 (in the same lane)
   - **Relative velocity**:
     - Ego Velocity: 4.5082 m/s
     - Obstacle Velocity: 11.41 m/s 
     - Relative velocity in direction of ego path ≈ 11.41 - 4.5082 = 6.9018 m/s (closing velocity)
   - **TTC calculation**:
     - Assuming the x-direction affects immediate longitudinal collision risk:
     - TTC = 3.6011 / 6.9018 ≈ 0.52 seconds

2. **Obstacle 20112.0**:
   - **Position at 3.4s**: (-28.2112, -114.4926)
   - **Relative position to Ego (3.4s)**: 
     - Longitudinal: 47.1361 - 28.2112 = 18.9249 (farther behind in the lanelet)
     - No significant lateral risk as it maintains a safe distance.

**Risk Assessment**:
- **Obstacle 20111.0**: The obstacle is closing in fast on the ego's path with a very short TTC (0.52 sec) and in the same lane, which suggests a **High Risk (2)** situation.
- **Obstacle 20112.0**: Has adequate separation and is further behind, posing **Low Risk (4)**.

Given these calculations, here's the JSON output summarizing the risk classification:

```json
{
    "CollisionObstacles": [],
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {},
    "HighRiskObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "20111.0",
        "OverallRiskScore": 2
    }
}
