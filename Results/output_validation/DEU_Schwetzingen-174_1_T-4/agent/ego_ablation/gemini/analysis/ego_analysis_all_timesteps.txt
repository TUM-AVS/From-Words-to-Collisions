At the most recent timestep (3.4 seconds), Obstacle 20111 poses an extreme risk of collision. It is located directly behind the ego vehicle at a longitudinal distance of -1.07 meters, closing in with a relative longitudinal velocity of 6.89 m/s. This translates to a very short TTC, well below 0.5 seconds, and an MDC of only 1.07 meters.  Therefore, Obstacle 20111 receives an overall risk score of 1 (Extreme Risk).

Obstacle 20112 is located at a longitudinal distance of -22.04 meters and a lateral distance of -1.36 meters (rear-right). While it's moving towards the ego vehicle both longitudinally and laterally, the distances and relative velocities suggest a low risk of collision in the immediate future. The MDC is significantly greater than 5 meters and the TTC is also much greater than 5 seconds. Thus, it's assigned an overall risk score of 5 (Negligible Risk).
