At t=3.4s, Obstacle 20111 is behind the ego vehicle at a longitudinal distance of -1.07m and lateral distance of 0.00m.  The relative longitudinal velocity is 6.89 m/s, indicating it is rapidly approaching the ego vehicle. Given the very short distance and high closing speed, a collision is imminent. Obstacle 20111 poses an extreme risk.

At t=3.4s, Obstacle 20112 is at a longitudinal distance of -22.04m and a lateral distance of -1.36m, placing it to the rear-right of the ego vehicle. While it is moving towards the ego vehicle both longitudinally and laterally, the distances and relative velocities (5.52 m/s longitudinal, 2.01 m/s lateral) suggest a lower risk level compared to Obstacle 20111.  While monitoring is necessary, immediate evasive action is less critical for this obstacle. Obstacle 20112 poses a medium risk.

Risk Levels:
0: Collision - Physical contact occurred or unavoidable
1: Extreme Risk - Immediate collision likely
2: High Risk - Close to collision, needs quick action
3: Medium Risk - Manageable with proper reaction
4: Low Risk - Minimal risk, sufficient time to react
5: Negligible Risk - No significant risk
