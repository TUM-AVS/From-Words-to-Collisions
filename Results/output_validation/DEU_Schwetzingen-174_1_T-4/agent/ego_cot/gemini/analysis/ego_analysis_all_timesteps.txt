### Safety analysis for timestep 3.4s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

**Calculations and Assumptions:**

Since precise ego vehicle and obstacle dimensions aren't provided, I'll assume a generic safety buffer of 0.5 meters added to the absolute longitudinal and lateral distances to account for vehicle size.  This creates the adjusted distances (`adjusted_d_long`, `adjusted_d_lat`). I'll use these adjusted distances to calculate Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC) and approximate Time to Collision (TTC).  The TTC calculation will assume constant velocity (which is a simplification). This assumption should be revisited if more data becomes available (e.g., relative acceleration).


**Obstacle Analysis:**

- **Obstacle ID: 20111**
    - Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 20111 is extremely close behind the ego vehicle. `adjusted_d_long` = |−1.07| + 0.5 = 1.57m, `adjusted_d_lat` = |−1.07| + 0.5 = 1.57m, indicating an extremely high risk of rear-end collision.  
    - Distance safety score: 2 (High Risk)
    - Time Risk reason:  Given the closing longitudinal velocity (6.89 m/s) and current distance (1.57m), TTC_long ≈ 1.57m/6.89m/s ≈ 0.23 seconds, which is extremely dangerous.
    - Time safety score: 1 (Extreme Risk)
    - Overall Risk score: 1 (Extreme Risk - imminent collision likely)

- **Obstacle ID: 20112**
    - Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 20112 is behind and to the right of the ego vehicle. `adjusted_d_long` = |−22.04| + 0.5 = 22.54 m, `adjusted_d_lat` =  |−22.04| + 0.5 = 22.54 m. While at a safe distance now, its trajectory and relative velocity suggest a potential risk in subsequent timesteps.
    - Distance safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
    - Time Risk reason: Given the closing longitudinal velocity (5.52 m/s) and current distance (22.54 m), TTC_long ≈ 22.54 m / 5.52 m/s ≈ 4.08 seconds. This provides some buffer, but continued monitoring is necessary.
    - Time safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
    - Overall Risk score: 4 (Low Risk)
