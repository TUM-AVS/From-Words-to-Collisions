To conduct this analysis, we'll assess the risk of collision for each obstacle at the last timestamp (3.4 seconds), using the trajectory information from the previous timestamps to predict immediate future positions and calculate risk scores. We will focus on the adjusted distances and velocities.

### Obstacle 20111 Analysis

**Trajectory Analysis Across Timesteps:**
- The obstacle has consistently been moving towards the ego vehicle from behind, with longitudinal distance decreasing steadily over time.
- **Distances and Velocities:**
  - At the latest timestep (3.4s), the longitudinal adjusted distance is approximately -1.07 meters with a relative longitudinal velocity of 6.89 m/s and a small lateral velocity of 0.50 m/s.
  - The obstacle has been maintaining a negative longitudinal distance, aligning laterally (0m lateral).

**Calculations:**
- **Time-to-Collision (TTC) Longitudinal:**
  \( \text{TTC} = \frac{-1.07}{6.89} \approx 0.155 \, \text{seconds} \)
- **Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC):**
  The MDC analysis shows that the longitudinal distance is continuously decreasing and nearing 0, with a consistent closing velocity.
  
**Risk Assessment:**
- **TTC** suggests extreme risk due to under 0.5 seconds.
- **MDC** is very small and decreases over time, confirming extreme risk or collision with lateral alignment.
- **Overall Risk Score:** 0 (Collision)

### Obstacle 20112 Analysis

**Trajectory Analysis Across Timesteps:**
- The obstacle is rear-right, approaching laterally and longitudinally towards the ego vehicle.
- **Distances and Velocities:**
  - At the latest timestep (3.4s), the obstacle's longitudinal adjusted distance is approximately -22.04 meters, lateral -1.36 meters.
  - Relative velocity longitudinal is 5.52 m/s, and lateral is 2.01 m/s.

**Calculations:**
- **Time-to-Collision (TTC) Longitudinal:**
  \( \text{TTC} = \frac{-22.04}{5.52} \approx 3.99 \, \text{seconds} \)
- **Time-to-Collision (TTC) Lateral:**
  Lateral approach velocity is 2.01 m/s with lateral distance changing from -1.76 m to -1.36 m.
  => TTC Lateral = \(\frac{-1.36}{2.01} \approx 0.677 \, \text{seconds} \)
- **Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC):**
  Combining these two dimensions suggests an issue with crossing or side collision risk due to the extreme lateral closure.

**Risk Assessment:**
- **TTC Lateral** suggests high risk.
- **MDC** and longitudinal progress suggest medium risk.
- **Overall Risk Score:** 2 (High Risk)
