At t=3.6s, Ego is at (-47.69, -94.93) with a velocity of 4.38 m/s. Obstacle 20111 is at (-45.04, -98.18) with velocity 11.50 m/s, and Obstacle 20112 is at (-29.79, -113.17) with velocity 10.36 m/s.

Obstacle 20111 poses an extreme risk.  The positions show a very small separation, and the large velocity difference suggests a likely imminent collision if the trajectories continue.  Obstacle 20112 is further away and does not present an immediate risk at this timestep. The trajectories over the preceding timesteps confirm Obstacle 20111's movement towards the Ego vehicle.
