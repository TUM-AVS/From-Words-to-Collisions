At t=3.6s, Ego is at (-47.69, -94.93) with a velocity of 4.38 m/s.

Obstacle 20111 is at (-45.04, -98.18) with a velocity of 11.50 m/s.  While the y-coordinates suggest some separation, the x-coordinates are converging rapidly given the velocity difference. Obstacle 20111's consistent acceleration and Ego's sudden deceleration at this timestep (from -0.09 to -1.04) heighten the risk. This suggests a possible emergency braking maneuver by the Ego vehicle, but more information is needed to determine if it will be sufficient to avoid a collision.  This obstacle presents an *Extreme Risk*.

Obstacle 20112 is at (-29.79, -113.17) with a velocity of 10.36 m/s.  This obstacle is significantly further away and poses no immediate threat.
