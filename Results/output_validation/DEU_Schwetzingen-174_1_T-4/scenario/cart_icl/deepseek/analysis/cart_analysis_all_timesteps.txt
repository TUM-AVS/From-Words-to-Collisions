### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. **Lanelet Analysis**: Ego is in lanelet 2510.0. Obstacles in the same lanelet are 20090.0, 20092.0, 20095.0, 20101.0, 20105.0, 20107.0, 20111.0, 20112.0, 20114.0.
2. **Trajectory Analysis**: Obstacles 20101.0, 20105.0, 20107.0, 20111.0, 20112.0, 20114.0 are moving towards ego with high speed (risk score 2).
3. **Collision Check**: No obstacles are in immediate collision path (risk score 0).
4. **Extreme Risk Check**: No obstacles are in extreme risk (risk score 1).
