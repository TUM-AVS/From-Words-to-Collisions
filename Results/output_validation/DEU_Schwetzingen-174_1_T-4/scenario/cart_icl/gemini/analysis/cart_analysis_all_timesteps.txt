### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 20111.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 20111.0 is in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle and rapidly approaching from behind. The distance between them has been decreasing consistently over the past 0.9 seconds. At the latest timestep, the obstacle is only about 10 meters behind the ego vehicle.
- Distance safety score: 2
- Time Risk reason: The obstacle's velocity is significantly higher than the ego vehicle's, and it is accelerating while the ego vehicle is decelerating slightly. This closing velocity dramatically increases the risk of collision.
- Time safety score: 2
- Overall Risk score: 2

- Obstacle ID: 20112.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 20112.0 is in the same lanelet, but significantly further behind than 20111.0.  While it is also approaching, the greater distance reduces the immediate risk.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: Although 20112.0 is traveling at a high speed and accelerating, the substantial distance gives the ego vehicle more time to react compared to 20111.0.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3


### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. Identified two obstacles (20111.0 and 20112.0) in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle at the final timestep (3.6s).
2. Obstacle 20111.0 poses a high risk due to its proximity, higher speed, and the closing rate relative to the ego vehicle.
3. Obstacle 20112.0 poses a medium risk as it is further away, providing more time to react despite the similar speed and acceleration profile.
4. The scenario is not a collision, but it presents a high risk due to 20111.0 rapidly approaching the ego vehicle from behind.
