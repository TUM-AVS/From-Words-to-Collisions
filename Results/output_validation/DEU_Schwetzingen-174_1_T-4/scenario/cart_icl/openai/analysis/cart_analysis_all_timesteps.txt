### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 20111**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle 20111 is in the same lanelet and is moving closer to the ego vehicle as both vehicles are on the same trajectory. However, the distance is still relatively manageable.
  - **Distance safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: The obstacle has a significantly higher velocity than the ego vehicle and is closing the gap rapidly, increasing the likelihood of a collision soon if no corrective actions are taken.
  - **Time safety score**: 2 (High Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 2 (High Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 20112**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Obstacle 20112 is further from the ego vehicle and is not in immediate proximity, maintaining a significant distance from the ego.
  - **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: Despite having a moderate velocity, obstacle 20112 doesn't pose an immediate threat in terms of time to collision, as its trajectory is away from the ego vehicle.
  - **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low Risk)

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. Obstacle 20111 is critically closer and faster than the ego vehicle, indicating a rising risk situation if the current velocities and accelerations persist.
2. Obstacle 20112, while present in the same lanelet, is maintaining a relatively safe distance and direction that does not indicate immediate collision risk.
3. Based on current dynamics, a collision is not immediate but high attention is needed for obstacle 20111 as it poses a high risk.
