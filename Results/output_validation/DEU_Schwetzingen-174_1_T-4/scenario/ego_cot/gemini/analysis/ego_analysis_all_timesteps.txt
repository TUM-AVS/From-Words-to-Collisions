### Safety analysis for timestep 2.7-3.6s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

**- Obstacle ID: 20111**
- Distance Risk reason:  Obstacle 20111 starts behind the ego vehicle and rapidly approaches, with longitudinal distance decreasing from -5.72m to collision at 3.6s. Lateral distance also decreases, indicating a potential rear-end collision or near miss.
- Distance safety score:  Scores degrade from 3 (2.7s) to 0 (3.6s) as the distance shrinks to zero.
- Time Risk reason:  The continuous decrease in longitudinal distance and the relative velocity suggest an imminent collision.  TTC becomes zero at 3.6s.
- Time safety score: Scores degrade from 2 (2.7s) to 0 (3.6s) as TTC reaches zero.
- Overall Risk score: Degrades from 2 (2.7s) to 0 (3.6s). Collision occurs at 3.6s.

**- Obstacle ID: 20112**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 20112 is behind and to the right of the ego vehicle.  While the longitudinal and lateral distances decrease over time, they remain relatively large, suggesting a lower risk compared to Obstacle 20111.  The decreasing distances, however, warrant monitoring.
- Distance safety score:  A consistent score of 4 throughout the scenario reflects the relatively safe distance maintained.
- Time Risk reason: The relative velocities and distances suggest that a collision is not imminent within the evaluated timeframe, but the obstacle's movement towards the ego vehicle should be monitored.
- Time safety score: A consistent score of 4 is assigned, although close observation is required for future time steps.
- Overall Risk score:  4 throughout, indicating low risk but the need for ongoing observation.


### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
  "CollisionObstacle": {
    "ObstacleID": "20111",
    "OverallRiskScore": "0"
  },
  "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null,
  "IsCollisionScenario": true,
  "Justification": "Obstacle 20111 collides with the ego vehicle at 3.6 seconds, as indicated by the zero longitudinal and lateral distance at that time step.  While Obstacle 20112 is approaching, it does not present an immediate collision risk within the provided data."
