### Obstacle-by-Obstacle Analysis (Most Recent Timestep: 3.6s)

#### **Obstacle 20111 (Behind → Collision)**
- **Position**: Longitudinal = 0.00m, Lateral = 0.00m  
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal = 7.10 m/s (approaching), Lateral = 0.63 m/s (approaching)  
- **Motion**: Exact longitudinal and lateral alignment (collision occurring).  
- **Trajectory Analysis**:  
  - From 2.7s to 3.6s, the longitudinal distance decreases from -5.72m to 0.00m with increasing velocity (6.39 m/s → 7.10 m/s).  
  - Lateral distance remains 0.00m (same lane), but lateral velocity is non-zero (0.63 m/s), indicating potential post-collision movement.  
- **TTC**:  
  - Longitudinal TTC = 0.00m / 7.10 m/s = **0.00s** (collision occurring).  
  - Lateral TTC = 0.00m / 0.63 m/s = **0.00s** (collision occurring).  
- **MDC**: 0.00m (vehicles are in contact).  
- **Risk Score**: **0 (Collision)**.  

#### **Obstacle 20112 (Rear-Right)**
- **Position**: Longitudinal = -20.90m, Lateral = -1.22m  
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal = 5.76 m/s (approaching), Lateral = 2.14 m/s (approaching).  
- **Motion**: Approaching from rear-right (both dimensions closing).  
- **Trajectory Analysis**:  
  - Longitudinal distance decreases from -25.28m (2.8s) to -20.90m (3.6s).  
  - Lateral distance fluctuates slightly but overall closes from -1.76m to -1.22m.  
- **TTC**:  
  - Longitudinal TTC = 20.90m / 5.76 m/s ≈ **3.63s** (Low Risk).  
  - Lateral TTC = 1.22m / 2.14 m/s ≈ **0.57s** (High Risk).  
- **MDC**: Minimum distance is lateral (1.22m), but both dimensions are closing.  
- **Risk Score**: **2 (High Risk)** due to lateral TTC < 1.0s.
