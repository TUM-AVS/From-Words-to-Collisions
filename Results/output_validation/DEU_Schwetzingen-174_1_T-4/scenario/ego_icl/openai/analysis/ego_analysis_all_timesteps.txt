### Obstacle-by-Obstacle Analysis

**Obstacle 20111:**
- **Latest Timestep:** At 3.6 seconds, it's indicated in a collision with the ego vehicle.
- **Longitudinal Distance Analysis:** 
  - At 3.6s, the longitudinal distance is 0.00m.
  - Relative velocity longitudinal component = 7.10 m/s, indicating it's rapidly approaching.
  - The negative distance trend from previous timesteps shows this obstacle has consistently been closing in on the ego vehicle.
  - Acceleration indicates it's slowing down but still converging.

- **Lateral Distance Analysis:**
  - At 3.6 seconds, lateral distance is exactly 0.00m, indicating exact alignment. Given longitudinal distance is also 0.00m, it confirms a collision.

- **TTC and MDC:**
  - TTC longitudinal = 0 seconds since they are at the same point.
  - MDC also results in 0 meters.

- **Risk Assessment:**
  - Risk score: 0 (Collision occurring).

**Obstacle 20112:**
- **Latest Timestep:** At 3.6 seconds, the obstacle is situated rear-right to the ego vehicle.
- **Longitudinal Distance Analysis:**
  - At 3.6s, longitudinal distance = -20.90m, with closing velocity of 5.76 m/s.
  - Consistently getting closer but still at a safe distance laterally.

- **Lateral Distance Analysis:**
  - At 3.6s, lateral distance = -1.22m, with a velocity of 2.14 m/s indicating it's converging laterally.
  
- **TTC and MDC:**
  - Since the obstacle is significantly distant both longitudinally and laterally, there is still some time before any potential collision path converges.
  - TTC overall is safe (greater than 5 seconds) as neither component is converging rapidly enough to be at risk.
  - MDC overall is safe (greater than 5m).

- **Risk Assessment:**
  - Risk score: 5 (No Risk).

### Conclusion

This situation is a collision scenario due to Obstacle 20111 being exactly on the collision point at the latest timestep, both longitudinally and laterally.
