### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 20111
- Relative Direction: Behind
- Distance Risk Reason: The obstacle is very close longitudinally (-0.38m) and directly behind the ego vehicle, indicating a very high risk of rear-end collision.  The longitudinal distance has been decreasing consistently over the past several timesteps, showing a persistent closing trend. Lateral distance is not a factor as the obstacle is directly behind.
- Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 1
- Lateral Distance Safety Score: 5
- Overall Distance Safety Score: 1.0
- Time Risk Reason: The TTClong is extremely low (0.06s), indicating imminent collision if the current trajectories continue. This value has been decreasing steadily over the past timesteps confirming the high risk. TTClat is not relevant in this 'Behind' scenario.
- Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 1
- Lateral Time Safety Score: 5
- Overall Time Safety Score: 1.0
- Overall Risk Score: 1

- Obstacle ID: 20112
- Relative Direction: Rear-right
- Distance Risk Reason: Longitudinally, the obstacle is far behind (-21.46m), presenting negligible risk in that direction.  Laterally, it is also at a safe distance (-1.44m).  Previous timesteps show a consistent trend of the obstacle approaching from behind and slightly from the right.  
- Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 5
- Lateral Distance Safety Score: 4
- Overall Distance Safety Score: 4.5
- Time Risk Reason:  TTClong is high (3.84s) and TTClat, although lower (0.68s), is still within a relatively safe margin. The trend over previous timesteps shows these values decreasing, warranting monitoring but not yet posing immediate danger.
- Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 4
- Lateral Time Safety Score: 2
- Overall Time Safety Score: 3.0
- Overall Risk Score: 4
