Here's the collision risk analysis:

**Ego Vehicle (20093.0):** The ego vehicle is decelerating within its lane (9888.0).  Its trajectory appears normal.

**Obstacle 20020.0:** Stationary and far from the ego vehicle, posing no immediate risk. Risk score: 5

**Obstacle 20027.0:** Stationary and far from the ego vehicle, posing no immediate risk. Risk score: 5

**Obstacle 20030.0:** Stationary and far from the ego vehicle, posing no immediate risk. Risk score: 5

**Obstacle 20080.0:**  Located in a different lane (9829.0) and further away from the ego vehicle. Although decelerating, its current trajectory doesn't present a direct risk. Risk score: 5

**Obstacle 20082.0:** In a different lane (1636.0) and moving away from the ego vehicle. Decelerating, which further reduces risk. Risk score: 5

**Obstacle 20083.0:** Located in a different lane (1636.0) and moving away from the ego vehicle. Although initially having a higher velocity, it's decelerating and not posing a direct risk. Risk score: 5

**Obstacle 20094.0:** This obstacle is in the same lane as the ego vehicle (9888.0) and its x-coordinate suggests a potential for collision. Requires close monitoring as the trajectories suggest converging paths within the ego vehicle's lane.  The distance between ego and this obstacle is decreasing over time. At t=8.1s, the distance is approximately sqrt((-0.2966 - 7.1192)^2 + (2.9539 - 6.3862)^2) = 7.86. At t=9.0s, the distance is approximately sqrt((-0.6704 - 3.3444)^2 + (2.0348 - 4.9505)^2) = 4.73. This obstacle represents a high risk. Risk score: 2

**Obstacle 20096.0:** Located in a different lane (1677.0) and moving away from the ego vehicle, posing no immediate risk.  Risk score: 5
