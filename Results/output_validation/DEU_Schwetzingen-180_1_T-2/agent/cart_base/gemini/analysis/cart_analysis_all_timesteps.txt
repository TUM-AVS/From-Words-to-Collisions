Here's the analysis of the scenario and the resulting JSON:

**Analysis:**

* **Obstacle 20020:** Stationary and far from the ego vehicle's trajectory.  Negligible risk.
* **Obstacle 20027:** Stationary and far from the ego vehicle's trajectory. Negligible risk.
* **Obstacle 20030:** Stationary and far from the ego vehicle's trajectory. Negligible risk.
* **Obstacle 20080:**  While somewhat close laterally, its longitudinal position and lanelet suggest it's not on a direct collision course. Low risk.
* **Obstacle 20082 and 20083:** These vehicles are moving away from the ego vehicle and pose no risk. Negligible risk.
* **Obstacle 20094:** This obstacle is in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle and is approaching closer over time. While not an immediate collision, the decreasing distance and same lanelet indicate a high risk.
* **Obstacle 20096:** This obstacle is in a different lanelet and moving away from the ego vehicle. Negligible Risk
