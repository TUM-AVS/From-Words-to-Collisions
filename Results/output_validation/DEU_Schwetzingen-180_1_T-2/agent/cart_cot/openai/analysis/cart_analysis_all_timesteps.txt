**Brief Analysis:**

In the final timestep (9.0 seconds), the ego vehicle and obstacles exhibit the following motion dynamics:

1. **Ego Vehicle (20093.0)**:
   - Position: (-0.6704, 2.0348), Velocity: 0.8042 m/s,  
   - The ego vehicle is gradually reducing its velocity and appears to be executing a slight directional drift suggested by changes in orientation. It is crucial to determine if it poses any threat of collision with nearby obstacles.

2. **Obstacle 20094.0**:
   - Position: (3.3444, 4.9505), Velocity: 2.0225 m/s
   - Located in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle. The obstacle is approaching the ego vehicle with a higher velocity. A detailed evaluation of its trajectory and relative motion indicates a high risk of collision since it potentially crosses the path of the ego's vehicle trajectory.

3. **Obstacle 20096.0**:
   - Position: (18.421, 8.542), Velocity: 3.1726 m/s
   - Although it has significant velocity, it's in a different lanelet and further away from the ego vehicle. Thus, it remains at low risk for the time studied.

No obstacles fall into Collision or Extreme Risk categories, but a careful assessment shows the following high-risk interaction due to close proximity and converging trajectories:
