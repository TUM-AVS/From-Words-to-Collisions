### Analysis of Risky Obstacles:

1. **Obstacle 20094.0**:  
   - **Position**: (3.3444, 4.9505) at 9.0s, moving towards ego with velocity 2.0225 m/s.  
   - **Relative Motion**: Ego is at (-0.6704, 2.0348), so the obstacle is ahead and to the right.  
   - **Distance**: ~4.0m (Euclidean distance).  
   - **TTC**: ~2.0s (assuming constant velocity).  
   - **Risk**: **High Risk (2)** - The obstacle is in the same lanelet (9888.0) and closing in, but not yet imminent.  

2. **Obstacle 20080.0**:  
   - **Position**: (2.602, -4.6425) at 9.0s, stationary (velocity 0.966 m/s, decelerating).  
   - **Relative Motion**: Far to the side (lateral distance ~6.7m).  
   - **Risk**: **Low Risk (4)** - No immediate danger due to lateral separation.  

3. **Obstacle 20096.0**:  
   - **Position**: (18.421, 8.542) at 9.0s, moving away from ego.  
   - **Risk**: **Negligible Risk (5)** - No meaningful risk.  

4. **Obstacle 20020.0, 20027.0, 20030.0**:  
   - **Stationary and far away** - **Negligible Risk (5)**.  

5. **Obstacle 20082.0, 20083.0**:  
   - **Moving away or laterally distant** - **Low Risk (4)**.
