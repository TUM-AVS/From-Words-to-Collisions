Obstacle 20094 is showing higher risk than others because it is in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle and the distance between them is decreasing across the timesteps. At t=9.0s, the distance is approximately 0.33m laterally and 3.34 longitudinally. Given the ego vehicle's orientation and the obstacle's position, there is a possibility of collision if the ego vehicle continues to decelerate and turn left while obstacle 20094 maintains its current trajectory. Additional information like lane boundaries, width of vehicles, and more precise trajectory predictions would enhance risk level accuracy. Other obstacles maintain a safe distance and don't pose an immediate risk.
