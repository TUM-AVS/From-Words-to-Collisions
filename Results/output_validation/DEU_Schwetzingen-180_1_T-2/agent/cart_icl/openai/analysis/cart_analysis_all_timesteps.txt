To perform a risk analysis, we will examine the trajectory and proximity of each obstacle relative to the Ego vehicle at the most recent timestep (9.0 seconds) while using earlier timesteps to identify trends in motion.

1. **Ego at 9.0s:**
   - Position: (-0.6704, 2.0348)
   - Velocity: 0.8042 m/s, decelerating
   - Orientation: -2.14 rad

2. **Obstacle Analysis at 9.0s:**

   - **Obstacle 20020.0:**
     - Stationary at (-6.3236, -0.3987), lanelet 9890.0.
     - Constant position indicates no immediate collision risk.

   - **Obstacle 20027.0 and 20030.0:**
     - Stationary obstacles at (-18.829, -3.4201) and (-27.5084, -5.5239) respectively.
     - Far behind, no immediate collision risk.

   - **Obstacle 20080.0:**
     - Position: (2.602, -4.6425), velocity: 0.966 m/s
     - Lateral distance maintained far, EUclideal distance ~5m
     - No immediate collision risk.

   - **Obstacle 20082.0:**
     - Position: (4.2341, -11.9055), velocity reduced significantly.
     - Large lateral separation, situated well outside immediate line.

   - **Obstacle 20083.0:**
     - Position: (6.5668, -22.4981), velocity: 3.3372 m/s.
     - Still maintains a significant longitudinal and lateral gap, outside collision threshold.

   - **Obstacle 20094.0:**
     - Position: (3.3444, 4.9505), velocity increased.
     - Shares lanelet 9888.0 with Ego vehicle, close and potentially risky if trajectory converges. However no immediate collision due to adequate lateral gap.
     - **Assessment:** Medium Risk (3) due to shared lanelet and increasing velocity.

   - **Obstacle 20096.0:**
     - Position: (18.421, 8.542), high velocity 3.1726 m/s.
     - Relative distance increasing due to different path and relatively significant distance.

3. **Summary and Risk Assessment:**
   - No collision detected in this timestep as MDC for all obstacles is significant.
   - Medium Risk is the highest observed level due to proximity of Obstacle 20094.0 with increased velocity within a shared lanelet.
