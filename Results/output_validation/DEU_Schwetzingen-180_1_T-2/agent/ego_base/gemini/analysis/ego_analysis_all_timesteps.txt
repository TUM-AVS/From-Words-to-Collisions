At t=9.0s:
- **Obstacle 20020**: Located front-right, longitudinal distance 0.58m, approaching at -0.80 m/s.  This is very close and represents a high risk. Risk score: 2.
- **Obstacle 20027**: Located front-right, longitudinal distance 9.86m, approaching at -0.80 m/s.  Safe distance, low risk. Risk score: 4.
- **Obstacle 20030**: Located front-right, longitudinal distance 16.30m, approaching at -0.80 m/s. Safe distance, negligible risk. Risk score: 5.
- **Obstacle 20080**: Located left, longitudinal distance 0.00m, lateral motion towards ego vehicle, lateral distance 4.74m. Close proximity laterally, and longitudinally aligned, posing a high risk of collision. Risk score: 2
- **Obstacle 20082**: Located front-left, longitudinal distance 4.60m, approaching at -1.39 m/s. Moderately close and approaching, medium risk. Risk score: 3.
- **Obstacle 20083**: Located front-left, longitudinal distance 12.28m, approaching at -3.17 m/s.  Approaching quickly, but enough distance for reaction, medium risk. Risk score: 3.
- **Obstacle 20094**: Located rear-left, longitudinal distance -0.11m, lateral distance 0.21m, approaching laterally. Very close proximity both longitudinally and laterally, extremely high risk. Risk score: 1.
- **Obstacle 20096**: Located rear-left, longitudinal distance -11.25m, approaching from behind at 1.32 m/s.  Safe distance, low risk. Risk score: 4.


Risk Levels:
0: Collision - Physical contact occurred or unavoidable
1: Extreme Risk - Immediate collision likely
2: High Risk - Close to collision, needs quick action
3: Medium Risk - Manageable with proper reaction
4: Low Risk - Minimal risk, sufficient time to react
5: Negligible Risk - No significant risk
