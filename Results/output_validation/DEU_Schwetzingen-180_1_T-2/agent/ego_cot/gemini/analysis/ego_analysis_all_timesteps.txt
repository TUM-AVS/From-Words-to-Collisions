### Safety analysis for timestep 9.0s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

First, we need to clarify the "adjusted distance" calculation.  Since the prompt doesn't provide ego vehicle or obstacle dimensions, I'll assume simplified adjustments where I subtract a safety margin (e.g., 0.25m) from the absolute longitudinal and lateral distances to simulate accounting for vehicle size. This margin is arbitrary in this example due to missing information.

**Adjusted Distance Calculation (Illustrative Example - Obstacle 20020 at t=9.0s):**
- `DTClong` = 0.58m
- `DTClat` = 0.58m
- `adjusted_d_long` = |0.58| - 0.25 = 0.33m
- `adjusted_d_lat` = |0.58| - 0.25 = 0.33m


### Obstacle Analysis:

- Distance Risk reason: Extremely close in front-right (adjusted_d_long = 0.33m, adjusted_d_lat=0.33m). Approaching with negative longitudinal velocity.
- Distance safety score: 1
- Time Risk reason:  Collision imminent if the current trajectory continues.
- Time safety score: 1
- Overall Risk score: 1

**Obstacle ID: 20027**

- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason:  No immediate risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

**Obstacle ID: 20030**
- Distance Risk reason: Safe distance in front-right (adjusted_d_long = 16.05m, adjusted_d_lat=16.05m).
- Distance safety score: 5

- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5


**Obstacle ID: 20094**
- Distance Risk reason: Very close in rear-left (adjusted_d_long = -0.36m, adjusted_d_lat=-0.36m). Approaching with positive longitudinal and negative lateral velocity.
- Distance safety score: 1
- Time Risk reason: Risk of collision due to lateral movement
- Time safety score: 1
- Overall Risk score: 1
