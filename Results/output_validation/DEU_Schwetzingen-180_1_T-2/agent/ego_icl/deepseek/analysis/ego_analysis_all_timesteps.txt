Let me analyze the obstacles at the most recent timestep (9.0 seconds) and assess collision risks:

1. Obstacle 20020 (Front-right):
   - Longitudinal: 0.58m (closing at -0.80 m/s)
   - Lateral: -1.85m (no relative motion)
   - TTC (long): 0.58/0.80 = 0.725s (High Risk)
   - MDC: Lateral distance stable at ~1.85m (Low Risk)
   - Overall Risk: High (2) - primary concern is frontal approach

2. Obstacle 20027 (Front-right):
   - Longitudinal: 9.86m (closing at -0.80 m/s)
   - Lateral: -10.76m (no relative motion)
   - TTC: 9.86/0.80 = 12.3s (No Risk)
   - MDC: Large lateral distance (No Risk)
   - Overall Risk: Negligible (5)

3. Obstacle 20030 (Front-right):
   - Longitudinal: 16.30m (closing at -0.80 m/s)
   - Lateral: -16.95m (no relative motion)
   - TTC: 16.30/0.80 = 20.4s (No Risk)
   - MDC: Large lateral distance (No Risk)
   - Overall Risk: Negligible (5)

4. Obstacle 20080 (Left):
   - Longitudinal: 0.00m (exact alignment, closing at -1.45 m/s)
   - Lateral: 4.74m (closing at -0.72 m/s)
   - TTC (lat): 4.74/0.72 = 6.58s (Low Risk)
   - MDC: Lateral distance decreasing but still >3m (Low Risk)
   - Overall Risk: Low (4) - side approach but sufficient distance

5. Obstacle 20082 (Front-left):
   - Longitudinal: 4.60m (closing at -1.39 m/s)
   - Lateral: 10.02m (closing at -0.59 m/s)
   - TTC (long): 4.60/1.39 = 3.31s (Medium Risk)
   - MDC: Lateral distance large (No Risk)
   - Overall Risk: Medium (3)

6. Obstacle 20083 (Front-left):
   - Longitudinal: 12.28m (closing at -3.17 m/s)
   - Lateral: 17.69m (closing at -2.36 m/s)
   - TTC (long): 12.28/3.17 = 3.87s (Low Risk)
   - MDC: Large distances (No Risk)
   - Overall Risk: Low (4)

7. Obstacle 20094 (Rear-left):
   - Longitudinal: -0.11m (approaching at 1.00 m/s)
   - Lateral: 0.21m (closing at -0.91 m/s)
   - TTC (lat): 0.21/0.91 = 0.23s (Extreme Risk)
   - MDC: Both distances <0.5m (Extreme Risk)
   - Overall Risk: Extreme (1) - imminent side collision

8. Obstacle 20096 (Rear-left):
   - Longitudinal: -11.25m (approaching at 1.32 m/s)
   - Lateral: 10.98m (closing at -2.36 m/s)
   - TTC (lat): 10.98/2.36 = 4.65s (Low Risk)
   - MDC: Large distances (No Risk)
   - Overall Risk: Low (4)

Trajectory Analysis:
- Obstacle 20094 shows dangerous convergence from rear-left, with both distances becoming very small (0.11m long, 0.21m lat)
- Relative velocities show it will make contact in next timestep
- Obstacle 20020 shows concerning frontal approach but still has safe lateral distance
- Other obstacles maintain safe distances
