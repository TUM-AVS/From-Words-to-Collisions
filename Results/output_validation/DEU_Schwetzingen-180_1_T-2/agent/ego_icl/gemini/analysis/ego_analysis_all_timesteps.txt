At t=9.0s:

* **Obstacle 20020 (Front-right):**
    - Longitudinal distance: 0.58m (approaching)
    - Lateral distance: -1.85m 
    - Longitudinal velocity: -0.80 m/s (approaching)
    - Lateral velocity: 0.00 m/s
    - Longitudinal TTC: 0.58m / 0.80m/s = 0.73s
    - MDC ≈ 0.58m (using longitudinal distance as it's the smaller and closing)
    - Risk Assessment: High Risk (2) due to close proximity and TTC < 1s. Although lateral distance is greater than 1m and stable, the rapidly closing longitudinal distance poses the more significant immediate threat.

* **Obstacle 20027 (Front-right):**
    - Longitudinal distance: 9.86m (approaching)
    - Lateral distance: -10.76m
    - Longitudinal velocity: -0.80 m/s (approaching)
    - Lateral velocity: 0.00 m/s
    - Longitudinal TTC: 9.86m / 0.80m/s = 12.33s
    - MDC ≈ 9.86m
    - Risk Assessment: No Risk (5) due to large distance.

* **Obstacle 20030 (Front-right):**
    - Longitudinal distance: 16.30m
    - Lateral distance: -16.95m
    - Longitudinal velocity: -0.80 m/s (approaching)
    - Lateral velocity: 0.00 m/s
    - Longitudinal TTC: 16.30 / 0.80 = 20.38s
    - MDC ≈ 16.30m
    - Risk Assessment: No Risk (5)

* **Obstacle 20080 (Left):**
    - Longitudinal distance: 0.00m (aligned)
    - Lateral distance: 4.74m (approaching)
    - Longitudinal velocity: -1.45 m/s (approaching)
    - Lateral velocity: -0.72 m/s (approaching)
    - Lateral TTC: 4.74m / 0.72m/s = 6.58s
    - MDC ≈ 4.74m
    - Risk Assessment: Low risk (4) because it is aligned longitudinally, but at a safe lateral distance.

* **Obstacle 20082 (Front-left):**
    - Longitudinal distance: 4.60m (approaching)
    - Lateral distance: 10.02m (approaching)
    - Longitudinal velocity: -1.39 m/s (approaching)
    - Lateral velocity: -0.59 m/s (approaching)
    - Longitudinal TTC: 4.60m / 1.39m/s = 3.31s
    - Lateral TTC: 10.02m / 0.59 m/s = 16.98s
    - MDC ≈ 4.60m
    - Risk Assessment: Low Risk (4) 

* **Obstacle 20083 (Front-left):**
    - Longitudinal distance: 12.28m
    - Lateral distance: 17.69m
    - Longitudinal velocity: -3.17 m/s (approaching)
    - Lateral velocity: -2.36 m/s (approaching)
    - Longitudinal TTC: 12.28m / 3.17m/s = 3.88s
    - Lateral TTC: 17.69m / 2.36m/s = 7.5s
    - MDC ≈ 12.28m
    - Risk Assessment: No Risk (5)

* **Obstacle 20094 (Rear-left):**
    - Longitudinal distance: -0.11m (behind, very close)
    - Lateral distance: 0.21m (very close)
    - Longitudinal velocity: 1.00 m/s (moving away)
    - Lateral velocity: -0.91 m/s (approaching)
    - Lateral TTC: 0.21m / 0.91m/s = 0.23s
    - MDC ≈ 0.21
    - Risk Assessment: Extreme Risk (1) due to very close proximity and high lateral closing velocity.  Even though the obstacle is slightly behind the ego vehicle, the lateral movement poses an extreme risk.

* **Obstacle 20096 (Rear-left):**
    - Longitudinal distance: -11.25m
    - Lateral distance: 10.98m
    - Longitudinal velocity: 1.32 m/s (moving away)
    - Lateral velocity: -2.36 m/s (approaching)
    - Lateral TTC: 10.98m / 2.36m/s = 4.65s
    - MDC ≈ 10.98m
    - Risk Assessment: No Risk (5)
