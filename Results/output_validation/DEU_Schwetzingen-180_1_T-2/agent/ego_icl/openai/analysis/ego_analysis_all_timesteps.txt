### Analysis of Obstacles at the Most Recent Timestep (9.0 seconds):

#### Obstacle 20020
- **Position and Motion:** In the front-right, real adjusted distance longitudinal 0.58m and lateral -1.85m. Approaching longitudinally with velocity -0.80 m/s, no lateral velocity.
- **Trajectory Analysis:** Decreasing longitudinal distance with constant velocity indicating approach towards the ego vehicle.
- **TTC Calculation (Longitudinal):** TTC = 0.58m / 0.80m/s = 0.725 seconds.
- **Risk Assessment:** With a TTC under 1.0 seconds, marked as a High Risk.
  
#### Obstacle 20027
- **Position and Motion:** In the front-right, adjusted longitudinal 9.86m and lateral -10.76m. Approaching longitudinally with velocity -0.80 m/s.
- **Trajectory Analysis:** Observed decreasing distance, but still at a safe separation due to slower approach.
- **TTC Calculation (Longitudinal):** TTC = 9.86m / 0.80m/s = 12.325 seconds.
- **Risk Assessment:** With large TTC, risk is Negligible for now.

#### Obstacle 20030
- **Position and Motion:** Front-right, adjusted distances 16.30m longitudinal and -16.95m lateral. Approaching longitudinally.
- **Trajectory Analysis:** Large distance maintained; slow approach rate indicates no immediate threat.
- **TTC Calculation (Longitudinal):** TTC = 16.30m / 0.80m/s = 20.375 seconds.
- **Risk Assessment:** Negligible Risk given current distance and trajectory.

#### Obstacle 20080
- **Position and Motion:** To the left of the ego with precise longitudinal alignment (longitudinal 0.00m), lateral 4.74m. Approaching laterally with velocity -0.72 m/s.
- **Trajectory Analysis:** Constant lateral closing.
- **MDC Calculation (Lateral):** MDC = approaching trajectory and low lateral distance suggests falling risk, but current distance safe.
- **Risk Assessment:** Low Risk due to approaching lateral.

#### Obstacle 20082
- **Position and Motion:** Front-left, adjusted distances 4.60m longitudinal and 10.02m lateral. Closing both longitudinally and laterally.
- **Trajectory Analysis:** Decreasing longitudinal and lateral distances.
- **TTC Calculation (Longitudinal):** TTC = 4.60m / 1.39m/s = 3.309 seconds.
- **MDC Calculation:** Projected path suggests approach, but maintained distance.
- **Risk Assessment:** Medium Risk due to manageable approaching path.

#### Obstacle 20083
- **Position and Motion:** Front-left, distances 12.28m longitudinal and 17.69m lateral. Both dimensions show approaching trajectory.
- **Trajectory Analysis:** Large distance with decreasing but safe trajectories.
- **Risk Assessment:** Negligible due to maintained safe distance.

#### Obstacle 20094
- **Position and Motion:** Rear-left, distances -0.11m longitudinal and 0.21m lateral. Approaching from behind.
- **Trajectory Analysis:** Approaching ego vehicle, very close proximity.
- **MDC and TTC:** Near-collision risk due to very close longitudinal distance.
- **Risk Assessment:** Extreme Risk due to proximity and approach.

#### Obstacle 20096
- **Position and Motion:** Rear-left, large separation with -11.25m longitudinal and 10.98m lateral. Approaching laterally.
- **Trajectory Analysis:** Distance maintained with slow lateral approach.
- **Risk Assessment:** Low-risk given current trajectory.

### Risk Summary:

```json

    "HighRiskObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "20020",
        "OverallRiskScore": "2"
    }
}
```

- **Obstacle 20094** poses a Collision risk due to very near proximity and closing rear trajectory.
- **Obstacle 20020** has a High Risk with a short TTC.
