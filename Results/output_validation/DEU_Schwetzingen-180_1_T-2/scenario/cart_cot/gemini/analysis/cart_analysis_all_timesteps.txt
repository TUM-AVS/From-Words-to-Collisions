- Obstacle ID: 20083.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is far from the ego vehicle and in a different lane. History shows it moving away from the ego vehicle.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Although moving, its trajectory history and different lane suggest no immediate risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 20094.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is in the same lane and approaching the ego vehicle. The distance is decreasing over time based on the history.
- Distance safety score: 2
- Time Risk reason:  The obstacle is moving towards the ego vehicle, and the history shows this trend. While not an immediate collision, the decreasing distance raises concern.
- Time safety score: 2
- Overall Risk score: 2

- Obstacle ID: 20096.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is relatively far from the ego vehicle and in a different lane. History shows it moving away from the ego vehicle.

- Time Risk reason:  The obstacle is moving away, and its trajectory history indicates no risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. **Most critical obstacle:** Obstacle 20094.0 is the most critical as it shares the same lanelet as the ego vehicle and is approaching.

2. **Trajectory Analysis:** Over the 10 timesteps, obstacle 20094.0 consistently moves closer to the ego vehicle while remaining in the same lane.  The ego vehicle is slowing down while 20094 is also decelerating but less rapidly.

3. **Relative Position, Velocity, and Acceleration:**  The relative positions show a decreasing trend, indicating potential future collision. Though both are decelerating, the closing distance is a significant factor.

4. **Collision Determination:** No collision has occurred yet. However, the consistent approach of obstacle 20094.0 over the provided timesteps, along with the current relative velocities and positions, suggests a high probability of a collision in the near future if no evasive action is taken.

5. **Reasoning:** While not an immediate collision, the persistent closing distance between the ego vehicle and obstacle 20094.0, along with the observed decelerations, requires prompt attention from the autonomous driving system to mitigate the risk.

  },
    "ScenarioAnalysis": {
        "IsCollisionScenario": false,
        "Reasoning": "Obstacle 20094.0 poses a high risk due to its decreasing distance to the ego vehicle in the same lane. While not an immediate collision at the most recent timestep, the trend over the past 10 timesteps indicates a very high likelihood of collision if no corrective action is taken by the ego vehicle."
