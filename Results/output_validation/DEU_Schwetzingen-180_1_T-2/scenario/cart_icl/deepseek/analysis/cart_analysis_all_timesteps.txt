### Safety Analysis for the Most Recent Timestep (9.2 seconds)

#### Key Observations:
1. **Ego Vehicle**: 
   - Position: (-0.7479, 1.8945)
   - Velocity: 0.645 m/s (decelerating at -0.4801 m/s²)
   - Lanelet: 9888.0

2. **Obstacle Proximity**:
   - Most obstacles are either stationary or moving away from the ego vehicle.
   - The closest dynamic obstacles are:
     - **20094.0**: Moving towards ego in the same lanelet (9888.0)
     - **20096.0**: Moving towards ego from lanelet 1677.0

### Obstacle Analysis:

#### Obstacle ID: 20020.0
- **Distance Risk Reason**: Stationary at (-6.3236, -0.3987), far from ego's path.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- **Time Risk Reason**: Zero velocity, no collision risk.
- **Time Safety Score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- **Overall Risk Score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 20094.0 (Critical Obstacle)
- **Distance Risk Reason**: At (2.4538, 4.419), moving towards ego in the same lanelet (9888.0).
- **Distance Safety Score**: 2 (High Risk)
- **Time Risk Reason**: Velocity = 2.1417 m/s, closing distance (~3.2m). TTC ≈ 1.5s.
- **Time Safety Score**: 2 (High Risk)
- **Overall Risk Score**: 2

#### Obstacle ID: 20096.0
- **Distance Risk Reason**: At (17.7777, 8.4346), moving towards ego from lanelet 1677.0.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 3 (Medium Risk)
- **Time Risk Reason**: Velocity = 3.3492 m/s, but lateral separation is significant.
- **Time Safety Score**: 3 (Medium Risk)
- **Overall Risk Score**: 3

#### Other Obstacles (20027.0, 20030.0, etc.):
- **Distance Safety Score**: 4-5 (Low/Negligible Risk)
- **Time Safety Score**: 4-5 (Low/Negligible Risk)
- **Overall Risk Score**: 4-5

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. **Collision Check**: No obstacles are in direct collision with the ego vehicle at the current timestep.
2. **Extreme Risk Check**: Obstacle 20094.0 is the closest dynamic threat but is not yet at extreme risk (TTC > 1s).
3. **Trend Analysis**: Over the last 9 timesteps, 20094.0 has been closing distance but decelerating slightly (acceleration = 1.1914 m/s²).
4. **Conclusion**: No immediate collision or extreme risk, but 20094.0 requires monitoring.
