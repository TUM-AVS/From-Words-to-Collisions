### Obstacle Analysis for the Most Recent Timestep (9.2 seconds):

- **Ego Vehicle Analysis**: The ego vehicle (ID: 20093.0) has been decelerating and reducing its velocity over the past timesteps, moving slightly towards the negative X direction with orientation change of about -2.0 radians. Its current velocity is low at 0.645 m/s, indicating a slowing or stopping trend.

1. **Obstacle ID: 20020.0**
   - Distance Risk Reason: The obstacle is stationary with no change in position or velocity, located in a separate lanelet.
   - Distance Safety Score: 5
   - Time Risk Reason: No relative movement towards the ego and stationary.
   - Time Safety Score: 5
   - Overall Risk Score: 5

2. **Obstacle ID: 20027.0**
   - Distance Risk Reason: Stationary and located in a different lanelet.
   - Distance Safety Score: 5
   - Time Risk Reason: No relative movement towards the ego.
   - Time Safety Score: 5
   - Overall Risk Score: 5

3. **Obstacle ID: 20030.0**
   - Distance Risk Reason: Stationary and not in conflict with the ego's path.
   - Distance Safety Score: 5
   - Time Risk Reason: No change in velocity or position.
   - Time Safety Score: 5
   - Overall Risk Score: 5

4. **Obstacle ID: 20080.0**
   - Distance Risk Reason: Separate lanelet, consistent velocity decrease, and not moving towards ego.
   - Distance Safety Score: 5
   - Time Risk Reason: Decelerating and in a different lanelet, no collision trajectory.
   - Time Safety Score: 5
   - Overall Risk Score: 5

5. **Obstacle ID: 20082.0**
   - Distance Risk Reason: Moderately close but slowing down and moving away from the ego's path.
   - Distance Safety Score: 4
   - Time Risk Reason: Consistent deceleration, decreasing risk over time.
   - Time Safety Score: 4
   - Overall Risk Score: 4

6. **Obstacle ID: 20083.0**
   - Distance Risk Reason: Moving relatively fast and parallel but slowly distancing.
   - Distance Safety Score: 4
   - Time Risk Reason: Continuous slight deceleration away from ego.
   - Time Safety Score: 4
   - Overall Risk Score: 4

7. **Obstacle ID: 20094.0**
   - Distance Risk Reason: In the same lanelet as the ego but increasing distance due to its higher velocity.
   - Distance Safety Score: 3
   - Time Risk Reason: Increasing velocity, heading direction slightly offsets collision path. Potential increasing interaction but manageable.
   - Time Safety Score: 3
   - Overall Risk Score: 3

8. **Obstacle ID: 20096.0**
   - Distance Risk Reason: In a different lanelet, moving steadily forward.
   - Distance Safety Score: 5
   - Time Risk Reason: Higher velocity, moving safely away, no direct collision path.
   - Time Safety Score: 5
   - Overall Risk Score: 5

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
- Assessing the scenario based on the position and velocity of ego and obstacles over the latest timestep, the ego is decelerating consistently with low velocity. None of the obstacles is on a direct collision path with the ego. Obstacle 20094.0 presents a moderate risk due to proximity in the same lanelet but is still adequately controlled, ensuring no collision scenario.
