Obstacle 20020 is at a longitudinal distance of 0.15m and approaching the ego vehicle at -0.64 m/s.  It is very close and poses a high risk.

Obstacle 20080 is at a longitudinal distance of 0.00m and a lateral distance of 4.44m.  While longitudinally aligned, its lateral motion towards the ego car at -0.60 m/s indicates a potential high risk. It will pass in front of the ego vehicle and probably enter the ego vehicle's lane.

Obstacle 20094 is at a longitudinal distance of 0.00m and a lateral distance of 0.01m.  This is extremely close and represents an extreme risk of collision.
