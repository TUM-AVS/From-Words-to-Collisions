### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
  "CollisionObstacle": {
    "ObstacleID": "20020",
    "OverallRiskScore": "0"
  },
  "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {
    "ObstacleID": "20020",
    "OverallRiskScore": "1"
  },
  "IsCollisionScenario": true,
  "Justification": "Obstacle 20020 shows a very high risk of collision at timestamp 8.4s, with distances near zero and negative relative velocities indicating an impending collision.  It is classified as a collision at timestamp 8.4s because the longitudinal and lateral distance are both 0.05m and the relative longitudinal velocity is -1.09 m/s, indicating an almost certain collision.  Obstacle 20020 is also at extreme risk at timestamp 8.3s as the distances are very small (0.47m) with a negative longitudinal relative velocity."
}
```
```
Key points in the continued analysis would include:

* Tracking Obstacle 20020 to see if the collision occurs as predicted.
* Monitoring Obstacle 20080 due to its close proximity and continued approach.
* Observing other obstacles for changes in their trajectories and risk levels.

The JSON summary would be updated accordingly if other collisions or extreme risk situations arise.  This response provides a template for how to conduct this analysis.  Remember to perform the full calculations for all provided timestamps and obstacles to accurately assess the risk.
