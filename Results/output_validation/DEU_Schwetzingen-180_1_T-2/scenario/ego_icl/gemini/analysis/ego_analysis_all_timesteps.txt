* **Obstacle 20020:** This obstacle is approaching the ego vehicle from the front-right.  Over the past few timesteps, it has been consistently moving closer longitudinally while maintaining a relatively stable lateral distance. In the most recent timestep, the longitudinal distance is a mere 0.15m and the lateral distance is -2.21 m. With a closing longitudinal velocity of -0.64 m/s, the TTC is 0.15m / 0.64m/s = 0.23s.  The MDC is approximately 0.15m. Both TTC and MDC indicate an *Extreme Risk (1)*.

* **Obstacle 20027:**  This obstacle is also approaching from the front-right but is much further away than 20020.  It poses a *Medium Risk (3)* based on its distance, although its trajectory suggests it should be monitored.

* **Obstacle 20030:** Similar to 20027, this obstacle is approaching from the front-right at a greater distance and poses a *Low Risk (4)*.

* **Obstacle 20080:** This obstacle is approaching from the front-left. The longitudinal distance is 0.00m, indicating alignment in that dimension. However, the lateral distance is 4.44m. With a closing lateral velocity of -0.60 m/s, there is some risk, but given the current separation, it's a *Medium Risk (3)*.

* **Obstacle 20082:** Approaching from the front-left, this obstacle is further away than 20080 and presents a *Low Risk (4)*.

* **Obstacle 20083:**  This front-left obstacle is even further away, posing a *No Risk (5)* currently.

* **Obstacle 20094:**  This obstacle is very close to the ego vehicle and is virtually aligned longitudinally (0.00m) and only 0.01m away laterally. Although the longitudinal velocity suggests it's slightly moving away from the ego vehicle, the lateral velocity (-1.10 m/s) indicates it is rapidly approaching laterally. The extremely small lateral distance combined with a significant closing lateral velocity indicates an *Extreme Risk (1)* of collision.

* **Obstacle 20096:** This rear-left obstacle poses a *No Risk (5)* given its current distance and although approaching, it is not doing so rapidly.

**Collision Scenario Determination:** Yes, this is a collision scenario. Obstacle 20020 and Obstacle 20094 both pose an Extreme Risk (1) with very low TTCs and MDCs, indicating imminent collisions.

  "Justification": "Obstacle 20020 and 20094 have an overall risk score of 1 (Extreme Risk) due to very low TTC (<0.5 seconds) and MDC (<0.5 meters) and converging trajectories. Obstacle 20094 is especially dangerous as it almost collides laterally with the ego car (0.01m)."
