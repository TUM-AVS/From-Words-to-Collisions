Analysis:

Obstacle 20058: This obstacle is stationary and poses no immediate threat.  It is far from the ego vehicle's trajectory. Risk score: 5

Obstacle 20060: This obstacle is moving but also poses no immediate threat. Its trajectory is not intersecting with the ego vehicle's, and maintains a safe distance. Risk score: 4

Obstacle 20064: This obstacle is moving in the same direction as the ego vehicle but at a higher speed and it is located ahead and to the side of the ego vehicle. Although there's a considerable distance now and no immediate collision risk is present in the given time steps, the higher speed of Obstacle 20064 could potentially lead to risky situations, especially given the ego vehicle's deceleration, if both vehicles continue on their current trajectory it may lead to a predicted extreme risk scenario. Risk score: 2, however, it is being flagged as a PredictedExtremeRiskObstacle.
