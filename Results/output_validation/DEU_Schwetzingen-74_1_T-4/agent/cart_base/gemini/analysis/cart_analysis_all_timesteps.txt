Obstacle 20058: This obstacle is stationary and poses no immediate risk as the ego vehicle is moving away from it. Risk score: 5 (Negligible Risk)

Obstacle 20060: This obstacle is moving slower than the ego vehicle and although in the same lanelet, the distance between them is increasing, reducing the risk over time.  It does not pose an immediate threat. Risk score: 4 (Low Risk)

Obstacle 20064: This obstacle is moving faster than the ego vehicle and is in the same lanelet.  The x-positions are converging, though the y-positions suggest some lateral separation.  However, over the observed time steps, the distance between the two vehicles is decreasing, indicating a growing potential for collision in the near future if this trend continues. Risk score: 2 (High Risk)
