Obstacle 20058 is stationary and poses no immediate risk.

Obstacle 20060 is moving slowly and its x-coordinate is decreasing, while ego vehicle's x-coordinate is decreasing more rapidly, meaning the distance in x direction is increasing.  Although the distance between the vehicles is decreasing, the current trajectories suggest the risk of collision is low given the trends in velocity and position.

Obstacle 20064's x-coordinate is decreasing, while ego vehicle's is also decreasing more rapidly, so they are moving away from each other in the x direction. The y-coordinates of both are decreasing and getting slightly closer, however, the overall distance between the vehicles is increasing over time, thus posing lower risk.
