### Analysis:

1. **Ego Vehicle (ID: 20062.0)**
   - Current position: (170.2415, -98.677) with a slight decreasing velocity trend over time.
   - The ego vehicle is in the same lanelet (5647.0) as all obstacles. It is maneuvering slightly leftward due to the evolving orientation.

2. **Obstacle 20058.0**
   - Stationary at position (144.8894, -98.2687).
   - As a stationary object, it does not pose an immediate risk as it remains at a safe distance from the ego vehicle.

3. **Obstacle 20060.0**
   - Latest position: (152.5761, -100.9956) with decreasing velocity.
   - Moving away from the ego vehicle along the lane, this vehicle is decelerating and at a greater distance, reducing immediate collision risk.

4. **Obstacle 20064.0**
   - Latest position: (174.3218, -95.8714).
   - Notably, this obstacle has the highest speed among all. Its trajectory is in the general direction towards the ego vehicle but lateral to its path.
   - Trajectory and speed could potentially intersect with the ego vehicle if unchecked, posing a collision risk.
   - Highest priority due to proximity and converging path.
