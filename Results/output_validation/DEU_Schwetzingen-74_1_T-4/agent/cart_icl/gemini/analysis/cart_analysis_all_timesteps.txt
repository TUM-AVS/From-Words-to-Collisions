Obstacle 20058 is stationary and far from the ego vehicle, posing negligible risk.

Obstacle 20060 is moving slower than the ego vehicle and decelerating. Although in the same lanelet, it's moving away from the ego vehicle, indicating a low risk.

Obstacle 20064, while initially approaching the ego vehicle rapidly, is also decelerating.  At the last timestep (3.2s), it maintains a safe lateral distance and the rate of closure is decreasing. This indicates a medium risk, requiring monitoring but not immediate evasive action.
