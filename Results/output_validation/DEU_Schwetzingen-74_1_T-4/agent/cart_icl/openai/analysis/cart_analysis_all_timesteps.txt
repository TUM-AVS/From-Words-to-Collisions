To evaluate the risk for each obstacle relative to the ego vehicle, let's consider the most recent timestep at 3.2 seconds. We will calculate the relative movements and determine the risk levels based on the time to collision (TTC) and minimum distance to collision (MDC).

1. **Obstacle 20058.0:**
   - **Position**: (144.8894, -98.2687)
   - **Velocity**: 0.0 (stationary)
   - **Relative Position**: Far behind, lateral distance negligible.
   - **Assessment**: Given that this obstacle is stationary and there is no immediate threat, the risk is negligible.

2. **Obstacle 20060.0:**
   - **Position**: (152.5761, -100.9956)
   - **Velocity**: 1.4912
   - **Relative Position**: Ahead of ego but decreasing speed suggests it is moving away.
   - **TTC**: Long due to decreasing relative speed and far position.
   - **Assessment**: The obstacle is ahead and moving with reduced speed. Risk is low.

3. **Obstacle 20064.0:**
   - **Position**: (174.3218, -95.8714)
   - **Velocity**: 5.3811
   - **Relative Movement**: Ahead slightly outside the lateral path of ego, decelerating.
   - **TTC**: High due to lateral discrepancy and speed.
   - **Assessment**: Although fast and ahead, it is outside the ego's immediate path. Risk is low.

Regarding collision risk levels, no object is found at risk levels 0 or 1 for the current timestep, but we must monitor if trends change.

### Final JSON Output

```json
{
    "CollisionObstacles": [],
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {},
    "HighRiskObstacle": {}
}
``` 

This output confirms no immediate collision risk despite proximity of obstacles in the same lanelet, with all factors considered.
