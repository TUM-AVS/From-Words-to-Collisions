At time 3.2 seconds, Obstacle 20064 poses an extreme risk of collision. Obstacles 20058 and 20060 do not pose any immediate risk.

Obstacle 20058: This obstacle is located 17.47 meters longitudinally and -11.04 meters laterally from the ego vehicle, placing it to the front-right. With a negative longitudinal relative velocity, it's approaching the ego vehicle but from a safe distance, given the lateral offset and the MDC value. Overall risk score: 5 (MDC > 5m, TTC > 5s).

Obstacle 20060: Situated 12.07m ahead and -4.93m to the right, this obstacle is also moving towards the ego vehicle with a low longitudinal velocity. The lateral movement and distance suggests that a collision is highly unlikely. Overall risk score: 5 (MDC > 5m, TTC > 5s).

Obstacle 20064: This obstacle is the most critical. Located only 0.42 meters behind the ego vehicle and exhibiting a high positive closing velocity, it implies a very high probability of a rear-end collision in the next instant if nothing changes.  Given the longitudinal distance and closing velocity, the TTC is extremely low, less than 0.5 seconds. Overall risk score: 1 (MDC < 0.5m, TTC < 0.5s).
