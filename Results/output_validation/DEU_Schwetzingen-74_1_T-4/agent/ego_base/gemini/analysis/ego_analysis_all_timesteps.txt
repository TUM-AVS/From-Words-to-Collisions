Obstacle 20058 is in the front-right of the ego vehicle, at a longitudinal distance of 17.47m and a lateral distance of -11.04m. It has a negative longitudinal relative velocity (-2.06 m/s), meaning it is moving towards the ego vehicle, but the distance is significant, and its lateral movement is negligible. This obstacle poses a low risk (Risk Score 4).

Obstacle 20060 is in the front-right, with a longitudinal distance of 12.07m and lateral distance of -4.93m.  While it is moving towards the ego vehicle longitudinally (-0.94 m/s) and away laterally (-0.98 m/s), the distances and relative velocities suggest a low risk (Risk Score 4).

Obstacle 20064 is behind the ego vehicle at a longitudinal distance of -0.42m.  It is closing in rapidly with a relative longitudinal velocity of 3.26 m/s. Given the minimal distance and the high relative velocity, this obstacle presents an extreme risk of collision (Risk Score 1).

Risk Levels:
0: Collision - Physical contact occurred or unavoidable
1: Extreme Risk - Immediate collision likely
2: High Risk - Close to collision, needs quick action
3: Medium Risk - Manageable with proper reaction
4: Low Risk - Minimal risk, sufficient time to react
5: Negligible Risk - No significant risk
