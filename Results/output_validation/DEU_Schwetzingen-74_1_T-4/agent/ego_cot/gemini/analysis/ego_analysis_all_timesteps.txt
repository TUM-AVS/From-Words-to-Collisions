### Safety analysis for timestep 3.2s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

**Assumptions and Calculations:**

Since the provided context lacks vehicle dimensions to calculate adjusted distances (adjusted_d_long and adjusted_d_lat), and precise TTC/MDC values cannot be determined without accurate relative velocities and accelerations, I will make reasonable assumptions based on general vehicle sizes and typical driving scenarios to illustrate the analysis process.  In a real-world application, you would use the provided vehicle dimensions and precise kinematic data.

* **General Vehicle Dimensions:** I'll assume a general vehicle length and width of 4 meters and 2 meters for both ego and obstacle vehicles for illustrative adjusted distance approximation.
* **TTC Approximation**: I will use a simplified TTC calculation `TTC = Distance / Relative Velocity`, acknowledging this lacks acceleration considerations and is an approximation for demonstration purposes.


### Obstacle Analysis:

**- Obstacle ID: 20058**
- Distance Risk reason:  Located front-right with longitudinal 17.47m and lateral 17.47m. Large distance and not an immediate threat. Assuming vehicle dimensions, adjusted distance suggests no risk.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason:  Moving slowly towards the ego vehicle longitudinally (-2.06 m/s), but the lateral distance is large, and no lateral movement is observed. Very large TTC.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

**- Obstacle ID: 20060**
- Distance Risk reason: Front-right at longitudinal 12.07m and lateral 12.07m.  Safe distance but warrants monitoring.  Adjusted distance still suggests low risk.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason:  Moving towards the ego vehicle longitudinally (-0.94 m/s) and slightly away laterally (-0.98 m/s). The longitudinal movement is slow, and the lateral movement is increasing the separation distance. Large TTC.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4


**- Obstacle ID: 20064**
- Distance Risk reason: Located behind the ego vehicle at longitudinal -0.42m and lateral -0.42m. This indicates a very close proximity behind the ego vehicle, adjusted distance implies almost touching bumpers.
- Distance safety score: 1 
- Time Risk reason:  The obstacle is rapidly approaching the ego vehicle from behind (3.26 m/s).  This implies a very short TTC, indicating extremely high risk.
- Time safety score: 1
- Overall Risk score: 1
