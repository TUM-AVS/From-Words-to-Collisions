Obstacle 20058:
- Trajectory: Consistently front-right, maintaining lateral distance around -11 to -13m while slightly approaching longitudinally.
- At t=3.2s: Longitudinal distance 17.47m, lateral -11.04m, long. velocity -2.06 m/s, lat. velocity -0.00 m/s.
- TTC (longitudinal): 17.47m / 2.06 m/s ≈ 8.5s. TTC (lateral): N/A due to zero lateral velocity.
- MDC: Negligible risk due to significant lateral separation.
- Risk: 5 (Negligible risk)

Obstacle 20060:
- Trajectory: Consistently front-right, increasing lateral distance from ~-5 m to ~-4.93m (moving right, away from ego), also slightly approaching longitudinally.
- At t=3.2s: Longitudinal distance 12.07m, lateral -4.93m, long. velocity -0.94 m/s, lat. velocity -0.98 m/s.
- TTC (longitudinal): 12.07m / 0.94 m/s ≈ 12.8s. TTC (lateral): 4.93m / 0.98 m/s ≈ 5s.
- MDC: No immediate collision risk. The obstacle might reach the ego vehicle in longitudinal distance, but it is moving away laterally.
- Risk: 5 (Negligible risk)

Obstacle 20064:
- Trajectory: Directly behind, rapidly approaching longitudinally, with minimal lateral movement.
- At t=3.2s: Longitudinal distance -0.42m, lateral 0.00 m, long. velocity 3.26 m/s, lat. velocity 0.79 m/s.
- TTC (longitudinal): 0.42m / 3.26 m/s ≈ 0.13s. TTC (lateral): N/A since laterally aligned.
- MDC: Extremely low; practically colliding longitudinally, with lateral alignment.
- Risk: 1 (Extreme risk)
