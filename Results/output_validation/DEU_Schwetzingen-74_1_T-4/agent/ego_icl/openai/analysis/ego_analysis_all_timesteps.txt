### Obstacle Analysis

**Obstacle 20058 (Front-right)**
- **Adjusted Longitudinal Distance:** 17.47 m
- **Adjusted Lateral Distance:** -11.04 m
- **Relative Velocity - Longitudinal:** -2.06 m/s
- **Relative Velocity - Lateral:** 0.00 m/s
- **Motion Description:** Moving toward the ego vehicle longitudinally, with no lateral relative motion.

**Trajectory Analysis:**
- Obstacle has been decreasing its longitudinal distance steadily while lateral distance remains grossly unchanged, indicating consistent approach trajectory.

**TTC Calculation (Longitudinal):** 
- \( \text{TTC} = \frac{17.47 \, \text{m}}{|{-2.06} \, \text{m/s}|} \approx 8.48 \, \text{seconds}\)

**MDC Calculation:**
- Since obstacles are diagonally positioned, we considered both dimensions.
- Lateral distance is significantly larger, hence MDC is more than 5 meters.

**Risk Assessment:**
- TTC is well over 5 seconds, and MDC is greater than 5 meters. This results in a Negligible Risk (5).

**Obstacle 20060 (Front-right)**
- **Adjusted Longitudinal Distance:** 12.07 m
- **Adjusted Lateral Distance:** -4.93 m
- **Relative Velocity - Longitudinal:** -0.94 m/s 
- **Relative Velocity - Lateral:** -0.98 m/s 
- **Motion Description:** Moving diagonally, both toward longitudinally and moving away laterally.

**Trajectory Analysis:**
- Obstacle consistently reduces both longitudinal and lateral distance over time, showing slight retreat on lateral path but remains approaching on longitudinal axis.

**TTC Calculation (Longitudinal and Lateral):**
- **Longitudinal TTC:** \( \text{TTC} = \frac{12.07 \, \text{m}}{|{-0.94} \, \text{m/s}|} \approx 12.84 \, \text{seconds}\)
- **Lateral distance increases** so no lateral collision is expected.

**MDC Calculation:**
- Larger of the two distances being analyzed and absence of critical lateral decrease, keeping the MDC over 5 meters.

**Risk Assessment:**
- Longe-term proximity in longitudinal range is adequately large, and one dimension is increasing in TTC, resulting in a Negligible Risk (5).

---

**Obstacle 20064 (Behind)**
- **Adjusted Longitudinal Distance:** -0.42 m
- **Adjusted Lateral Distance:** 0.00 m
- **Relative Velocity - Longitudinal:** 3.26 m/s 
- **Relative Velocity - Lateral:** 0.79 m/s 
- **Motion Description:** Driving towards the ego with direct longitudinal alignment.

**Trajectory Analysis:**
- Despite closing rapid longitudinal gap, exact alignment raises severe possibility of rear collision.

**TTC Calculation (Longitudinal):**
- **Longitudinal TTC:** \( \text{TTC} = \frac{0.42 \, \text{m}}{3.26 \, \text{m/s}} \approx 0.13 \, \text{seconds}\)

**MDC Calculation:**
- Approaching implies hazardous proximity with critical alignment and decreasing distance.

**Risk Assessment:**
- Immediate trajectory places this obstacle in Critical imminent collision risk with a score of 1 (Extreme Risk).

### Conclusion
- **Obstacle 20064** presents an Extreme Risk due to significantly reduced longitudinal distance alongside closure velocity, indicating a near-immediate collision possibility.
- Other obstacles remain in the Negligible Risk category due to large distance buffers or diverging paths.
