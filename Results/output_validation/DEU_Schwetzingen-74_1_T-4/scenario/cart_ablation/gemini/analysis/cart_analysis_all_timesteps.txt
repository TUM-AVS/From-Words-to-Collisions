At t=3.4s, Ego (20062.0) is at (169.8802, -98.8773) with a velocity of 2.0425 m/s.  Let's analyze the obstacles:

* **Obstacle 20058.0:** Stationary at (144.8894, -98.2687). Poses no immediate threat.

* **Obstacle 20060.0:** At (152.3126, -100.9156), velocity 1.2651 m/s.  Decreasing velocity.  No immediate risk.

* **Obstacle 20064.0:** At (173.4901, -96.5094), velocity 5.101 m/s.  This obstacle is close to Ego and moving relatively faster, representing the highest risk.  Lateral separation is concerning, but the longitudinal gap and current velocities do not suggest an immediate or certain collision within the next immediate timestep (assuming a timestep of 0.1s). This situation warrants close monitoring and categorizes as a high risk (2) due to proximity and speed differential but doesn't yet qualify as "Extreme Risk" due to remaining separation. The negative acceleration of this obstacle, and the continued motion of the ego vehicle, also help mitigate the risk, such that it would not be deemed an immediate or certain collision.

Since no obstacle presents a risk score of 0 or 1,  "CollisionObstacles" and "ExtremeRiskObstacles" are set to null.

```json
{
  "CollisionObstacles": [],
  "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null,
  "ScenarioAnalysis": {
    "IsCollisionScenario": false,
    "Reasoning": "No obstacle presents an immediate collision risk at t=3.4s. Obstacle 20064.0 poses the highest risk due to its proximity and higher velocity relative to Ego, but there is still separation."
