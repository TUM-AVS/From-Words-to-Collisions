Obstacle 20064 is moving at a high velocity (5.101) relative to the ego vehicle (2.0425) and is in the same lanelet.  The x-positions are converging (169.8802 for ego and 173.4901 for obstacle 20064). Although there is a small lateral distance between them currently, the high relative velocity and closing distance in the next few moments suggest a high risk of collision if obstacle 20064 does not decelerate significantly or the ego vehicle accelerates or changes lanes.  This warrants an extreme risk assessment.
