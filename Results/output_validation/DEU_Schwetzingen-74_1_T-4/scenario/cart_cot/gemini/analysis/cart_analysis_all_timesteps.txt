### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 20058.0
- Distance Risk reason: This obstacle is far from the ego vehicle and stationary.  Its position has not changed over the provided timesteps.  It poses no immediate threat.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason:  Since the obstacle is stationary and far away, there's no time-dependent risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 20060.0
- Distance Risk reason: Although this obstacle is in the same lanelet, it's a safe distance behind the ego vehicle and its decelerating. Examining the past trajectory confirms it's moving slower than the ego vehicle. 
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: The obstacle is moving slower and decelerating, further reducing the risk over time. The historical data supports this.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- Obstacle ID: 20064.0
- Distance Risk reason: This obstacle is somewhat closer to the ego vehicle and in the same lane, however, the y-coordinates suggest it might be slightly to the side and ahead of the ego vehicle.  While proximity warrants attention, it's not an immediate collision risk at this specific moment.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason:  The obstacle's velocity is higher than the ego vehicle's, but it's also decelerating.  This requires monitoring to ensure a safe distance is maintained.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. **Most critical obstacles:** Obstacle 20064.0 presents the most immediate concern due to its proximity and higher velocity relative to the ego vehicle, although it is decelerating.
2. **Trajectory analysis:** Over the 10 timesteps, Obstacle 20064.0 has been consistently ahead of the ego vehicle, but the distance between them doesn't appear to be dramatically decreasing, suggesting the deceleration is effective. Obstacle 20060.0 is consistently behind the ego vehicle and decelerating. Obstacle 20058.0 is stationary and far away, posing no threat.
3. **Relative positions, velocities, and accelerations:**  Obstacle 20064.0 is ahead and to the side of the ego vehicle, with a higher velocity but also a noticeable deceleration. Obstacle 20060.0 is behind the ego vehicle, moving slower, and decelerating.
4. **Collision determination:** Based on the current data, a collision is not imminent in the very near future.  Obstacle 20064.0's deceleration suggests that a safe distance might be maintained. However, continuous monitoring is essential, as any unexpected change in acceleration could alter this assessment. 
5. **Reasoning:** No obstacle is currently on a direct collision course.  While Obstacle 20064.0 is the closest and initially moving faster, its deceleration suggests it's unlikely to collide imminently.  The other obstacles pose no immediate threat due to their distance and relative velocities.
