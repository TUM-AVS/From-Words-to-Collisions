### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 20058.0
- Distance Risk reason: Stationary and laterally separated from ego's trajectory. No risk observed in the provided timesteps.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason:  Stationary, poses no immediate time-related risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 20060.0
- Distance Risk reason:  Laterally offset and behind the ego vehicle.  The distance has been increasing over the past timesteps.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason:  Moving slower than ego and decelerating. The time to collision is increasing.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 20064.0
- Distance Risk reason:  Ahead of the ego vehicle and in the same lane, but with a significant and increasing lateral offset.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason:  Moving faster than the ego vehicle, but the lateral offset and ego's slight deceleration mitigate the risk.  Continuous monitoring needed.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4


### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
No obstacle poses an immediate collision risk.  All obstacles maintain a safe distance, and their trajectories suggest this will continue in the near future. Therefore, this is not a collision scenario.
