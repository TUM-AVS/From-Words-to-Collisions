### Safety Analysis for the Most Recent Timestep:
Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

1. **Obstacle ID: 20058.0**
   - **Distance Risk Reason:** This obstacle remains stationary with no velocity or acceleration, suggesting no movement towards the ego vehicle. Relative positions between the ego and this obstacle indicate a stable situation.
   - **Distance Safety Score:** 5
   - **Time Risk Reason:** Given the obstacle has been stationary throughout the entire time period, there is minimal risk in terms of time-dependent collision.
   - **Time Safety Score:** 5
   - **Overall Risk Score:** 5

2. **Obstacle ID: 20060.0**
   - **Distance Risk Reason:** Historically moving forward but decelerating, this obstacle's path aligns slightly away from the ego, keeping a steady spatial difference.
   - **Distance Safety Score:** 4
   - **Time Risk Reason:** With a continued decrease in velocity, the relative rate suggests a reduced likelihood of collision over time. The trend shows a movement away from the ego.
   - **Time Safety Score:** 4
   - **Overall Risk Score:** 4

3. **Obstacle ID: 20064.0**
   - **Distance Risk Reason:** Obstacle moving at higher speeds but rapidly decelerating and continuing a lateral movement slight away from the ego vehicle.
   - **Distance Safety Score:** 3
   - **Time Risk Reason:** Despite the prominent velocity, its general trajectory and deceleration trend indicate that it does not project into the egoâ€™s path.
   - **Time Safety Score:** 3
   - **Overall Risk Score:** 3

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
- No collision scenario detected as none of the obstacles have an overall risk score of 0.
- All obstacles either stationary or maintaining a trajectory and speed such that they deviate further or do not intersect with the ego vehicle.
