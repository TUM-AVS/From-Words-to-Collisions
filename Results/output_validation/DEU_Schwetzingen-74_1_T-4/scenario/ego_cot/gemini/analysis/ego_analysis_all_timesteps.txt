### Safety analysis for timestep 2.5s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 20058
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is 17.77m longitudinally and laterally away from the ego vehicle, located in the front-right.  No immediate risk.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason:  The relative longitudinal velocity is negative, indicating the obstacle is moving towards the ego vehicle, but the large distance mitigates immediate risk.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- Obstacle ID: 20060
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is 11.96m longitudinally and laterally away from the ego vehicle, positioned front-right.  Moderate distance, but moving away laterally.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: While there is a small negative longitudinal velocity, the positive longitudinal acceleration suggests the obstacle might be slowing down or stopping, reducing the risk. Lateral movement away further decreases risk.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- Obstacle ID: 20064
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is very close behind the ego vehicle (-2.96m longitudinally and laterally). High risk of collision.
- Distance safety score: 1
- Time Risk reason: Positive relative longitudinal velocity indicates the obstacle is approaching rapidly from behind.  Very high risk.
- Time safety score: 1
- Overall Risk score: 1


### Safety analysis for timestep 2.6s - 3.3s:
(Analysis similar to 2.5s, with progressively increasing risk from Obstacle 20064 due to decreasing distance and persistent positive relative velocity/acceleration.)


### Safety analysis for timestep 3.4s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 20058
- Distance Risk reason:  Still at a safe distance front-right.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason:  Similar to previous timesteps.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- Obstacle ID: 20060
- Distance Risk reason: Similar to previous timesteps.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason:  Similar to previous timesteps.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- Obstacle ID: 20064
- Distance Risk reason: Collision has occurred (0m distance).
- Distance safety score: 0
- Time Risk reason:  Collision confirmed.
- Time safety score: 0
- Overall Risk score: 0
