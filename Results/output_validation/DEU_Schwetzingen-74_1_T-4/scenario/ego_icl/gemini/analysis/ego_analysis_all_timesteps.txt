* **Obstacle 20058 Analysis:**

This obstacle is in the front-right of the ego vehicle.  Across the provided timesteps, its longitudinal distance slightly decreases while the lateral distance remains relatively constant.  At the last timestep (3.4s), it's at 17.06m longitudinal and -11.04m lateral distance.  The relative longitudinal velocity is -2.04 m/s (moving away) and the lateral velocity is -0.00 m/s.

Given the distances and the separating motion, there is no immediate risk.

* **Obstacle 20060 Analysis:**

This obstacle is also front-right.  The longitudinal distance stays around 12m and the lateral distance decreases across timesteps. The last timestep shows a longitudinal distance of 11.85m and a lateral distance of -5.12m. Relative velocities are  -1.18 m/s (longitudinally away) and -0.93 m/s (laterally away).

No collision risk is present for this obstacle.

* **Obstacle 20064 Analysis:**

This obstacle is behind the ego vehicle and poses the most significant risk. Its longitudinal distance starts at -2.96m (behind) and progresses closer to 0.00m at the final timestep. Lateral distance remains 0.00m, which means the obstacle remains directly behind the ego vehicle. The relative longitudinal velocity is positive (3.00 m/s at the last timestep), indicating that it's rapidly closing the distance.

At t=3.4s, the distances are 0.00m longitudinal and 0.00m lateral. This, combined with the closing longitudinal velocity of 3.00 m/s, clearly indicates a collision has occurred. MDC is 0. TTC is 0.

**Collision Scenario Determination:**

Yes, this is a collision scenario. Obstacle 20064 has collided with the ego vehicle at t=3.4s.
