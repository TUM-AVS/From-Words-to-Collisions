### Analysis of Obstacles at the Most Recent Timestep (3.4 seconds)

#### Obstacle 20058

- **Position and Trajectory**: 
  - At 3.4 seconds, obstacle located in the front-right of the ego vehicle.
  - Adjusted Distances: Longitudinal 17.06 m, Lateral -11.04 m.
  - Relative velocity: Longitudinal -2.04 m/s, Lateral -0.00 m/s.
  - Motion: Driving toward the ego car longitudinally with no lateral relative motion.

- **Risk Assessment**:
  - **Longitudinal TTC**: Distance/Velocity = 17.06 m / 2.04 m/s ≈ 8.36 seconds.
  - **Lateral TTC**: No lateral movement, hence no relevant TTC.
  - **MDC**: Longitudinal distance of 17.06 meters is dominant.
  - Both TTC and MDC indicate a **No Risk (5)** due to large distances and approaching velocity.

#### Obstacle 20060

- **Position and Trajectory**: 
  - Located in the front-right of ego vehicle.
  - Adjusted Distances: Longitudinal 11.85 m, Lateral -5.12 m.
  - Relative velocity: Longitudinal -1.18 m/s, Lateral -0.93 m/s.
  - Motion: Driving toward the ego car longitudinally, moving away laterally to the right.

- **Risk Assessment**:
  - **Longitudinal TTC**: Distance/Velocity = 11.85 m / 1.18 m/s ≈ 10.04 seconds.
  - **Lateral TTC**: Not relevant as obstacle is moving laterally away.
  - **MDC**: Longitudinal approach is more influenced by large distance.
  - Both TTC and MDC result in a **No Risk (5)** due to significant distances and lateral divergence.

#### Obstacle 20064

- **Position and Trajectory**:
  - Located directly behind the ego vehicle, moving towards it.
  - Adjusted Distances: Longitudinal -0.10 m, Lateral 0.00 m.
  - Relative velocity: Longitudinal 3.13 m/s, Lateral 0.77 m/s.
  - Motion: Exact longitudinal and lateral alignment.

- **Risk Assessment**:
  - **Longitudinal TTC**: Not applicable since position is almost coincident.
  - **Immediate Proximity**: Proximity and alignment indicate imminent collision.
  - **MDC**: Practical MDC is near 0 m.
  - Risk scoring indicates **Collision (0)** due to proximity and closed trajectory.

### Conclusion
Given the analysis above, Obstacle 20064 presents a Collision Risk of 0 due to its immediate proximity and approaching motion toward the ego vehicle, resulting in a collision scenario. The calculated MDC and situation alignment confirm this is an immediate collision scenario.
