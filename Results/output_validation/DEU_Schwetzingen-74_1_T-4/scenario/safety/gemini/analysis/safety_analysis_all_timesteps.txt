### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
                    - Obstacle ID: 20058
                    - Relative Direction: Front-right
                    - Distance Risk Reason: DTClong is >5 indicating negligible longitudinal risk, while DTClat is >5 (effectively infinite due to no lateral motion), indicating negligible lateral risk. These values have remained relatively stable over the past few timesteps.
                    - Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 5
                    - Lateral Distance Safety Score: 5
                    - Overall Distance Safety Score: 5.0  (5 * 0.5 + 5 * 0.5)
                    - Time Risk Reason: TTClong is > 5 suggesting negligible risk, and TTClat is infinite, indicating no lateral risk. These values have remained fairly consistent throughout the scenario.
                    - Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 5
                    - Lateral Time Safety Score: 5
                    - Overall Time Safety Score: 5.0 (5 * 0.5 + 5 * 0.5)
                    - Overall Risk Score: 5 (0.5 * 5.0 + 0.5 * 5.0 = 5.0)

                    - Obstacle ID: 20060
                    - Relative Direction: Front-right
                    - Distance Risk Reason: DTClong is > 5, indicating low longitudinal risk, while DTClat is >5 (effectively infinite due to lateral movement away), signifying negligible lateral risk.  The longitudinal distance has decreased slightly, but the lateral distance has increased, decreasing risk.
                    - Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 5
                    - Lateral Distance Safety Score: 5
                    - Overall Distance Safety Score: 5.0 (5* 0.5 + 5 * 0.5)
                    - Time Risk Reason: TTClong is > 5 and decreasing suggesting low longitudinal risk and TTClat is infinite, indicating no lateral risk. These values have decreased but remain high.
                    - Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 5
                    - Lateral Time Safety Score: 5
                    - Overall Time Safety Score: 5.0 (5 * 0.5 + 5 * 0.5)
                    - Overall Risk Score: 5 (0.5 * 5.0 + 0.5 * 5.0 = 5.0)

                    - Obstacle ID: 20064
                    - Relative Direction: Behind
                    - Distance Risk Reason: DTClong is 0 indicating a collision, DTClat is 0 as well. 
                    - Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 0
                    - Lateral Distance Safety Score: 0
                    - Overall Distance Safety Score: 0.0 (0 * 1.0 + 0 * 0.0)
                    - Time Risk Reason: TTClong is 0 indicating a collision, TTClat is 0 too.
                    - Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 0
                    - Lateral Time Safety Score: 0
                    - Overall Time Safety Score: 0.0 (0 * 1.0 + 0 * 0.0)
                    - Overall Risk Score: 0 (0.5 * 0.0 + 0.5 * 0.0 = 0)
