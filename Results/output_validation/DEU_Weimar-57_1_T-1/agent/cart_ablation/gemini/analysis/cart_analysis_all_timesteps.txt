Here's the collision risk analysis:

**Ego Vehicle (ID: 14.0):** The ego vehicle maintains a near-constant velocity and position in lanelet 832.0 throughout the provided timeframe. Its minimal movement doesn't present an immediate collision risk by itself.

**Obstacle 0.0:** Stationary and located far from the ego vehicle in a different lanelet (1979.0). Poses no risk.

**Obstacle 8.0:** Stationary and located far from the ego vehicle in a different lanelet (1979.0). Poses no risk.

**Obstacle 17.0:** Located in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle (832.0) and moving with increasing velocity towards the ego vehicle. Although the distance is initially significant, the rapid acceleration and high closing speed of obstacle 17.0 suggest a collision is probable by extrapolation. This obstacle poses a high risk in the near future and a predicted extreme risk given the current trajectories and accelerations.

**Obstacle 19.0:** Stationary and located in a different lanelet (87.0). Poses no risk.

**Obstacle 22.0:** Stationary and located in a different lanelet (87.0). Poses no risk.

**Obstacle 25.0:** Located in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle (832.0) but farther ahead and moving slowly in the same general direction as the ego vehicle with increasing velocity. Given the current state, the risk is minimal. However the acceleration is positive and needs to be monitored in the future. This represents a medium risk.

**Obstacle 31.0:** Stationary and located in a different lanelet (87.0). Poses no risk.

**Obstacle 32.0:** Located in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle (832.0) but farther ahead and moving slowly in the same general direction as the ego vehicle. The risk is minimal.

**Obstacle 48.0:** Located in a different lanelet (86.0), but exhibiting high velocity and acceleration. Its trajectory suggests a possible lane change or maneuver that could bring it into the ego vehicle's path. This requires close monitoring, and a lane change by this obstacle would immediately create a very high or extreme risk scenario. Currently, it represents a low risk.
