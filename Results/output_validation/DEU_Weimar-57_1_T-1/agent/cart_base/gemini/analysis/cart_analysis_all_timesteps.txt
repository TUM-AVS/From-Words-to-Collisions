Obstacle 0 and 8: Located in a different lanelet (1979) and stationary. They pose no risk to the ego vehicle in lanelet 832. Risk 5 - Negligible Risk.

Obstacle 17:  This obstacle is in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle (832) and is approaching the ego vehicle from behind at an increasing velocity.  While not an immediate collision risk, the rapid acceleration and closing distance warrant attention and place this obstacle in the High-Risk category. Risk 2 - High Risk

Obstacle 19, 22, 31: These obstacles are in a different lanelet (87) and are stationary.  They present no risk to the ego vehicle. Risk 5 - Negligible Risk.

Obstacle 25 and 32: These obstacles are in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle (832) and are ahead of the ego vehicle. They are moving away from the ego vehicle and pose no risk. Risk 5 - Negligible Risk.


Obstacle 48: This obstacle is in a different lanelet (86), but its high velocity and trajectory towards the ego vehicle's general area represent a potential risk.  More information on the lanelets' relative positions and the obstacle's intended path would be needed to give a definitive assessment.  However, given the speed and movement direction, this obstacle is classified as a Medium Risk. Risk 3 - Medium Risk
