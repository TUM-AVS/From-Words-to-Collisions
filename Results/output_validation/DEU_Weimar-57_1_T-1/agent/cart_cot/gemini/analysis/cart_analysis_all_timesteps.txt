Obstacle 17 shows a concerning trend. It's in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle and rapidly accelerating towards it.  While not an immediate collision, the rapid velocity increase and same lanelet occupancy necessitate close monitoring. If this trend continues, intervention will be necessary.

Obstacle 48, despite being in a different lanelet, exhibits high velocity and acceleration.  Its trajectory's angle and increasing speed require attention. While a collision is not imminent in the very next timestep, the potential for its future trajectory to intersect with the ego vehicle's path necessitates a higher risk assessment.
