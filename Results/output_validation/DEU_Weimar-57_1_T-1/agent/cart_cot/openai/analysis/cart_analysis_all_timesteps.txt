### Analysis:

From the data provided, let's analyze the risk levels based on the position, velocity, and acceleration of each obstacle relative to the Ego vehicle at the most recent timestep (9.0 seconds).

1. **Obstacle 17.0** is moving towards the Ego in the same lanelet with a significant velocity (2.743) and acceleration (1.6959). Due to its velocity and acceleration directed towards the Ego, this poses a very high risk of collision. The relative position is also quite near, creating an immediate risk.

2. **Obstacle 48.0** is moving with a very high velocity of 12.3667 towards a different direction, and although it is not in the same lanelet as the Ego, the speed and trajectory suggest a significant risk, but the risk is primarily kinematic due to its high speed in proximity to the Ego's environment, potentially crossing paths especially given the excess velocity.

3. Obstacles **25.0** and **32.0** are also within the Ego's lanelet with increasing velocities and accelerations but are currently further away and not as imminent as those outlined above. They represent increased risks if trends maintain due to the relative proximity of their lanes and increasing speeds.

Here's the structured JSON output summarizing the obstacles with risks based on the analyzed data:

```json
{
    "CollisionObstacles": [
        {
            "ObstacleID": "17.0",
            "OverallRiskScore": 0
        }
    ],
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "48.0",
        "OverallRiskScore": 1
    },
    "HighRiskObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "25.0",
        "OverallRiskScore": 2
    }
}
```

### Explanation:

- **Obstacle 17.0 (Collision Risk Score 0)**: Positioned in the same lanelet as the Ego vehicle with rapidly approaching velocity and acceleration, resulting in an unavoidable collision if current trends continue without evasive action.

- **Obstacle 48.0 (Extreme Risk Score 1)**: The high speed of this obstacle, although not in the Ego's current lane, suggests a serious risk due to its potential to cross into the Ego's path quickly if conditions change, needing immediate monitoring and potentially urgent measures to avoid any rapid scenario development.

- **Obstacle 25.0 (High Risk Score 2)**: This obstacle's trajectory and velocity are increasing in the same lanelet, presenting a potential collision risk which necessitates prompt attention and possibly alterations in the Ego's path or speed to maintain safe distances.
