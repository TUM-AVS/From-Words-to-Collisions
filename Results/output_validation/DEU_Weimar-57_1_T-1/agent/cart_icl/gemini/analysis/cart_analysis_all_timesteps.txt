Obstacle 17 is accelerating towards the ego vehicle and is in the same lanelet (832). Its x-coordinate is rapidly decreasing, indicating a possible collision in the near future.

Obstacle 48 is in a different lanelet but moving at a high speed with a decreasing y-coordinate, which suggests that a collision is possible when it changes lanes or makes a turn.  Further analysis considering lane change probabilities and intersection proximity would be necessary to finalize the risk level for this obstacle.
