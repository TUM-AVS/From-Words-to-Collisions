At t=9.0s, the ego vehicle faces several potential risks.

* **Obstacle 0:** Located 17.55m longitudinally and 0.78m laterally (front-left), poses a negligible risk with no relative motion.  Score: 5
* **Obstacle 8:**  Located 24.92m longitudinally and 2.15m laterally (front-left), poses a negligible risk with no relative motion. Score: 5
* **Obstacle 17:** Located -0.54m longitudinally and 0.00m laterally (behind), represents a **high risk** due to its close proximity and relative velocity of 2.72 m/s approaching the ego vehicle from behind. Although the MDC is small, it's not yet within the collision range.  The risk is primarily due to the potential for a rear-end collision if the ego vehicle were to brake suddenly. Score: 2.
* **Obstacle 19:** Located 2.37m longitudinally and 9.43m laterally (front-left), poses a medium risk considering its longitudinal proximity. The lateral distance reduces the immediate risk. Score: 3
* **Obstacle 22:** Located 1.07m longitudinally and 16.82m laterally (front-left) represents a medium risk. Score: 3
* **Obstacle 25:** Located -9.27m longitudinally and -0.17m laterally (rear-right), poses a low risk as it is approaching from behind with a relative velocity of 1.53 m/s, but there's still ample distance. Score: 4
* **Obstacle 31:** Located 0.00m longitudinally and 24.15m laterally (left), represents a negligible risk with no relative motion. Score: 5
* **Obstacle 32:** Located -17.42m longitudinally and -1.22m laterally (rear-right), poses a negligible risk as it approaches from behind but with ample distance. Score: 5
* **Obstacle 48:** Located 4.18m longitudinally and 19.08m laterally (front-left) poses a low risk, with ample lateral distance and although moving longitudinally towards the ego vehicle, there is space and time to react. Score: 4
