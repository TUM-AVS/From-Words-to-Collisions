At t=9.0s:
- **Obstacle 0:** Front-left, 17.55m longitudinal, 0.78m lateral distance. No relative motion. Low risk (5).
- **Obstacle 8:** Front-left, 24.92m longitudinal, 2.15m lateral distance. No relative motion. Low risk (5).
- **Obstacle 17:** Behind, -0.54m longitudinal, 0.00m lateral distance. Approaching quickly from behind at 2.72 m/s longitudinally.  Extreme risk (1).
- **Obstacle 19:** Front-left, 2.37m longitudinal, 9.43m lateral distance. No relative motion.  Medium risk (3).
- **Obstacle 22:** Front-left, 1.07m longitudinal, 16.82m lateral distance. No relative motion. Medium Risk (3) due to very close longitudinal distance.
- **Obstacle 25:** Rear-right, -9.27m longitudinal, -0.17m lateral distance. Approaching from behind at 1.53 m/s. Medium risk (3).
- **Obstacle 31:** Left, 0.00m longitudinal, 24.15m lateral distance. No relative motion. Low risk (5).
- **Obstacle 32:** Rear-right, -17.42m longitudinal, -1.22m lateral distance. Approaching from behind at 0.73 m/s. Low risk (4).
- **Obstacle 48:** Front-left, 4.18m longitudinal, 19.08m lateral distance. Moving away laterally, approaching longitudinally at -2.37 m/s. Medium risk (3)

Risk Levels:
0: Collision - Physical contact occurred or unavoidable
1: Extreme Risk - Immediate collision likely
2: High Risk - Close to collision, needs quick action
3: Medium Risk - Manageable with proper reaction
4: Low Risk - Minimal risk, sufficient time to react
5: Negligible Risk - No significant risk
