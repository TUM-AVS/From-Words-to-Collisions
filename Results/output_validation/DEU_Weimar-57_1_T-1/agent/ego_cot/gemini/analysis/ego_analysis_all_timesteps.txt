### Safety analysis for timestep 9.0s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

**Assumptions and Clarifications:**

* Since the provided scenario lacks ego vehicle dimensions and TTC calculations, I will make assumptions based on typical vehicle sizes and simplified TTC estimations based on relative velocity and distance.
* I'm assuming "real distance" refers to the center-to-center distance between vehicles.  I will adjust these distances based on an assumed ego vehicle length of 4 meters and width of 2 meters, and approximate obstacle dimensions, to estimate corner-to-corner distances (adjusted_d_long, adjusted_d_lat) for a more realistic proximity assessment. Note there's some lateral relative distance (DTClat) to calculate MDC and TTClat. I'll assume relative sizes of the obstacles to be approximately similar to the ego vehicle for adjustment purposes.


### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 0**
- Distance Risk reason: Located 17.55m longitudinally and laterally in the front-left.  Poses no immediate risk.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason:  Stationary relative to the ego vehicle. No TTC calculated, assumed safe.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 8**
- Distance Risk reason: Located 24.92m longitudinally and laterally in the front-left. Poses no immediate risk.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Stationary relative to the ego vehicle. No TTC calculated, assumed safe.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 17**
- Distance Risk reason: Located -0.54m longitudinally and laterally behind. Very close proximity indicates imminent collision.
- Distance safety score: 0
- Time Risk reason: Closing velocity and close proximity indicate imminent collision.
- Time safety score: 0
- Overall Risk score: 0

- **Obstacle ID: 19**
- Distance Risk reason: Located 2.37m longitudinally and laterally in the front-left.  High risk due to close proximity.
- Distance safety score: 2
- Time Risk reason: Stationary relative to the ego vehicle but very close, assumed to be a high risk
- Time safety score: 2
- Overall Risk score: 2

- **Obstacle ID: 22**
- Distance Risk reason: Located 1.07m longitudinally and laterally in the front-left. Extremely close proximity.
- Distance safety score: 1
- Time Risk reason: Stationary relative to the ego vehicle but very close, assumed to be an extreme risk
- Time safety score: 1
- Overall Risk score: 1

- **Obstacle ID: 25**
- Distance Risk reason: Located -9.27m longitudinally and laterally behind right.  Currently safe but approaching.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Approaching, needs monitoring.  Assuming medium risk based on distance and closing velocity.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3

- **Obstacle ID: 31**
- Distance Risk reason: Located at precisely 0m longitudinally and laterally left. Collision is imminent.
- Distance safety score: 0
- Time Risk reason: Stationary and overlapping the ego. Collision is certain.
- Time safety score: 0
- Overall Risk score: 0

- **Obstacle ID: 32**
- Distance Risk reason: Located -17.42m longitudinally and laterally behind right.  Currently safe.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Approaching but at a safe distance.  Assuming low risk.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 48**
- Distance Risk reason: Located 4.18m longitudinally and laterally in the front-left.  Low risk.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason:  Moving away laterally, but slightly approaching longitudinally, medium risk overall.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3
