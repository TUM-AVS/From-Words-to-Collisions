At t=9.0s:

* **Obstacle 0:** Front-left, longitudinal 17.55m, lateral 0.78m.  Relative velocity is zero in both directions. No immediate risk, but monitor. Risk Level 5.

* **Obstacle 8:** Front-left, longitudinal 24.92m, lateral 2.15m. Relative velocity is zero in both directions. No immediate risk. Risk Level 5.

* **Obstacle 17:** Behind, longitudinal -0.54m, lateral 0.00m.  Relative longitudinal velocity 2.72 m/s. This obstacle is very close behind and rapidly approaching. TTC = 0.54/2.72 = 0.2s.  Extreme Risk. Risk Level 1.

* **Obstacle 19:** Front-left, longitudinal 2.37m, lateral 9.43m. Relative velocity is zero in both directions.  Medium risk due to proximity. Risk Level 3.

* **Obstacle 22:** Front-left, longitudinal 1.07m, lateral 16.82m. Relative velocity is zero in both directions. Medium risk due to proximity. Risk Level 3.

* **Obstacle 25:** Rear-right, longitudinal -9.27m, lateral -0.17m.  Approaching from behind and slightly to the right. Longitudinal velocity is 1.53 m/s. TTC = 9.27/1.53 ≈ 6s. Low risk. Risk Level 4.

* **Obstacle 31:** Left, longitudinal 0.00m, lateral 24.15m. Relative velocity is zero in both directions. No immediate risk. Risk Level 5.

* **Obstacle 32:** Rear-right, longitudinal -17.42m, lateral -1.22m.  Approaching from behind. Longitudinal velocity 0.73 m/s. TTC = 17.42/0.73 ≈ 24s. No risk. Risk Level 5.

* **Obstacle 48:** Front-left, longitudinal 4.18m, lateral 19.08m. Moving away laterally. Longitudinal velocity is -2.37 m/s, meaning it's moving away longitudinally. Low risk. Risk Level 4.
