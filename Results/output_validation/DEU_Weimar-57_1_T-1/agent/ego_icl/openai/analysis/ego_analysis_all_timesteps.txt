Let's analyze each obstacle from the most recent timestep (at 9.0 seconds) based on their given positions, velocities, and motion descriptions. 

1. **Obstacle 0:**
   - **Position and Motion:** In the Front-left, adjusted longitudinal distance 17.55m, lateral distance 0.78m.
   - **Velocity and Trajectory:** No relative velocity. Motion: driving toward the ego car longitudinally.
   - **Analysis:** The lack of relative velocity indicates stable positioning. The longitudinal distance confirms no imminent risk.
   - **Risk Assessment:** No risk (5).

2. **Obstacle 8:**
   - **Position and Motion:** In the Front-left, adjusted longitudinal distance 24.92m, lateral distance 2.15m.
   - **Velocity and Trajectory:** No relative velocity. Motion: driving toward the ego car longitudinally.
   - **Analysis:** The stable position and significant distance imply no immediate risk.
   - **Risk Assessment:** No risk (5).

3. **Obstacle 17:**
   - **Position and Motion:** In the Behind, adjusted longitudinal distance -0.54m, lateral distance 0.00m.
   - **Velocity and Trajectory:** Longitudinal velocity 2.72 m/s, closing towards ego. The obstacle is driving toward the ego car from behind.
   - **TTC Calculation:** 
     - TTC = |(-0.54m) / 2.72 m/s| = ~0.20 seconds
   - **Analysis:** TTC indicates extreme risk (1) due to the rapidly closing distance with high alignment and speed.
   - **Risk Assessment:** Extreme risk (1).

4. **Obstacle 19:**
   - **Position and Motion:** In the Front-left, adjusted longitudinal distance 2.37m, lateral distance 9.43m.
   - **Velocity and Trajectory:** No relative velocity. Motion: driving toward the ego car longitudinally.
   - **Analysis:** The stable positioning and lack of relative motion suggest minimal risk.
   - **Risk Assessment:** Low risk (4).

5. **Obstacle 22:**
   - **Position and Motion:** In the Front-left, adjusted longitudinal distance 1.07m, lateral distance 16.82m.
   - **Velocity and Trajectory:** No relative velocity. Motion: driving toward the ego car longitudinally.
   - **Analysis:** The distance is marginal but stable, indicating no immediate risk.
   - **Risk Assessment:** Low risk (4).

6. **Obstacle 25:**
   - **Position and Motion:** In the Rear-right, adjusted longitudinal distance -9.27m, lateral distance -0.17m.
   - **Velocity and Trajectory:** Longitudinal velocity 1.53 m/s, closing slightly.
   - **TTC Calculation:** 
     - Longitudinal component not immediately threatening at current speed.
   - **Analysis:** Though closing, the separation is currently sufficient to avoid collision.
   - **Risk Assessment:** Medium risk (3).

7. **Obstacle 31:**
   - **Position and Motion:** In the Left, adjusted longitudinal distance 0.00m, lateral distance 24.15m.
   - **Velocity and Trajectory:** No relative velocity.
   - **Analysis:** Distance indicates no risk due to lack of relative movement.
   - **Risk Assessment:** No risk (5).

8. **Obstacle 32:**
   - **Position and Motion:** In the Rear-right, adjusted longitudinal distance -17.42m, lateral distance -1.22m.
   - **Velocity and Trajectory:** Slow closing velocity.
   - **Analysis:** Distance and speed do not pose an immediate risk.
   - **Risk Assessment:** Low risk (4).

9. **Obstacle 48:**
   - **Position and Motion:** In the Front-left, adjusted longitudinal distance 4.18m, lateral distance 19.08m.
   - **Velocity and Trajectory:** Moving away laterally. Longitudinal relative velocity -2.37 m/s suggests divergence.
   - **Analysis:** Paths are diverging with enough distance to pose no immediate risk.
   - **Risk Assessment:** No risk (5).
