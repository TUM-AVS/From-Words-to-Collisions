At t=9.2s, Ego (ID 14) is at (12.3368, -0.0312) in lanelet 832.  Obstacle 17 is at (16.7824, 0.5428), also in lanelet 832, and moving with increasing velocity towards Ego. Obstacle 25 is also in the same lanelet as Ego, at (25.7633, 1.6995), with increasing velocity. Other obstacles are in different lanelets and pose no immediate threat.

Obstacle 17 shows the most immediate risk. The x-coordinates and y-coordinates are close to the ego vehicle, and the obstacle's velocity is increasing while Ego is almost stationary. This indicates a very high probability of collision in the next few timesteps. Obstacle 25, while also in the same lanelet, is further away from the ego. This makes obstacle 17 more critical and therefore represents the greatest risk.

  "ScenarioAnalysis": {
    "IsCollisionScenario": false,
    "Reasoning": "Obstacle 17 poses an extreme risk of collision with Ego in the next timesteps due to close proximity and significantly higher, increasing velocity in the same lanelet.  Obstacle 25 is also approaching Ego from behind, so deserves continuous monitoring, but does not represent as high a risk at the present time due to greater distance from Ego."
