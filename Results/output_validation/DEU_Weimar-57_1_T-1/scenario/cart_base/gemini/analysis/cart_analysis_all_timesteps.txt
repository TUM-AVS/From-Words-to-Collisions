Obstacle 17 is in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle and is approaching rapidly from behind.  While it's not an immediate collision at this timestep (9.2 seconds), the high closing velocity and acceleration suggest an extreme risk of collision in the very near future. Obstacle 25 is also in the same lanelet and is accelerating, representing a high risk but not as imminent as Obstacle 17. Obstacle 48 poses a lower risk; while its velocity is high, its trajectory in a different lanelet and current lateral distance suggest more time to react. Obstacles 0, 8, 19, 22, and 31 are stationary and not currently a risk. Obstacle 32, while in the same lanelet and accelerating, is far enough ahead to be considered a lower risk.
