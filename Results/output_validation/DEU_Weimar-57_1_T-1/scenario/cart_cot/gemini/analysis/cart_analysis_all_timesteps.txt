### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:

- Obstacle ID: 0.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is far from the ego vehicle and in a different lanelet.  History shows it is stationary.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Obstacle is stationary, posing no immediate time-related risk. History confirms consistent lack of motion.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 8.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is far from the ego vehicle and in a different lanelet. History shows it is stationary.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Obstacle is stationary, posing no time-related risk. History confirms consistent lack of motion.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 17.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is in the same lanelet and approaching the ego vehicle rapidly from behind.  History shows it is accelerating towards the ego vehicle.
- Distance safety score: 2
- Time Risk reason: The obstacle's high velocity and acceleration, combined with its trajectory history, suggest a high risk of collision in the near future.
- Time safety score: 2
- Overall Risk score: 2

- Obstacle ID: 19.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is far from the ego vehicle and in a different lanelet. History indicates it is stationary.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Obstacle is stationary, posing no time-related risk. History confirms its stationary status.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 22.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is far from the ego vehicle and in a different lanelet. History shows that it is stationary.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Obstacle is stationary, posing no time-related risk. History confirms consistent lack of motion.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 25.0
- Distance Risk reason:  Obstacle is in the same lanelet, ahead of, and moving slower than the ego vehicle.  History shows it moving away.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Though in the same lane, the obstacle's lower speed and distance from the ego, along with its trajectory history, suggest low risk.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- Obstacle ID: 31.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is far from the ego vehicle and in a different lanelet. History indicates it is stationary.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Obstacle is stationary. History confirms its stationary status.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 32.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is in the same lanelet and far ahead of the ego vehicle. History shows it is moving away.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: While in the same lanelet, its distance and slow speed relative to the ego, coupled with its trajectory history, suggest negligible risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 48.0
- Distance Risk reason: The obstacle is moderately far from the ego vehicle, but its trajectory over the past several timesteps indicates it is moving towards the ego vehicle's lanelet at a high speed.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: Obstacle's high velocity and movement towards the ego vehicle's lane pose a medium-term risk. Historical trajectory reinforces this concern.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3



### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. **Most critical obstacle:** Obstacle 17.0 presents the most immediate risk. It is in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle, approaching rapidly from behind with increasing velocity.

2. **Trajectory analysis:** Over the 10 timesteps, Obstacle 17.0 consistently gains on the ego vehicle. Its acceleration suggests this trend will continue. Other obstacles maintain safe distances and trajectories or are stationary.

3. **Relative position, velocity, and acceleration:** Obstacle 17.0 exhibits concerning relative motion. Its position gets closer, its velocity difference increases, and its acceleration suggests further closing the gap.

4. **Collision determination:** While a collision has not yet occurred, the trends strongly indicate a likely collision if the ego vehicle does not react.

5. **Reasoning:** Obstacle 17.0's persistent high relative velocity and acceleration in the same lanelet, coupled with its closing distance, point to an impending collision unless evasive action is taken.
