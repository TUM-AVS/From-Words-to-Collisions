### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. **Obstacle 17** is the primary concern, moving towards ego in the same lanelet with high velocity and acceleration.
2. Other obstacles in the same lanelet are at safe distances and velocities.
3. No collision has occurred yet, but Obstacle 17 poses an extreme risk if current trajectories continue.
4. Ego vehicle is moving very slowly (0.0011 m/s), making it vulnerable to faster-moving obstacles.
