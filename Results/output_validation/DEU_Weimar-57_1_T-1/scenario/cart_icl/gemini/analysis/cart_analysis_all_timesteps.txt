### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 0.0
- Distance Risk reason: Far away from ego, different lanelet.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Stationary.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5
- Obstacle ID: 8.0
- Distance Risk reason: Far away from ego, different lanelet.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Stationary.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5
- Obstacle ID: 17.0
- Distance Risk reason: In the same lanelet, moving towards ego but still some distance away.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason:  Closing velocity is high and increasing, needs attention.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3
- Obstacle ID: 19.0
- Distance Risk reason: Far away from ego, different lanelet.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Stationary.

- Distance Risk reason: Far away from ego, different lanelet.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Stationary.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5
- Obstacle ID: 25.0
- Distance Risk reason: In the same lanelet, further ahead of ego.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Moving slower than surrounding traffic, but accelerating.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4
- Obstacle ID: 31.0
- Distance Risk reason: Far away from ego, different lanelet.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Stationary.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5
- Obstacle ID: 32.0
- Distance Risk reason: In the same lanelet, far ahead of ego.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason:  Moving slower than ego.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5
- Obstacle ID: 48.0
- Distance Risk reason: Although in a different lanelet, obstacle is approaching the ego vehicle rapidly.
- Distance safety score: 2
- Time Risk reason: High velocity and accelerating, poses a potential risk if it changes lanes.
- Time safety score: 2
- Overall Risk score: 2


### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
No immediate collision detected. Obstacle 17 is approaching ego quickly in the same lane but not an immediate collision risk. Obstacle 48 shows concerning behavior with its high speed and acceleration, although in a different lanelet currently. No obstacle poses an immediate collision threat at the last timestep.
