  - Time Risk Reason: Zero velocity or acceleration, consistent stationarity.
  - Time Safety Score: 5
  - Overall Risk Score: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 17.0**
  - Distance Risk Reason: Approaching the ego vehicle but maintaining an offset, unlikely to cause collision due to trajectory.
  - Distance Safety Score: 4
  - Time Risk Reason: Increasing velocity indicates potential future intersection, yet manageable at current speed/direction.
  - Time Safety Score: 4
  - Overall Risk Score: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 19.0**

  - Time Safety Score: 5
  - Overall Risk Score: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 32.0**
  - Distance Risk Reason: Consistent lateral and longitudinal separation, reducing immediate collision risk.
  - Distance Safety Score: 4
  - Time Risk Reason: Slight acceleration managed by current trajectories and distances.
  - Time Safety Score: 4
  - Overall Risk Score: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 48.0**
  - Distance Risk Reason: High velocity but on a different trajectory; unlikely to intersect with the ego vehicle.
  - Distance Safety Score: 4
  - Time Risk Reason: Acceleration maintained but away from the path of ego vehicle.
  - Time Safety Score: 4
  - Overall Risk Score: 4

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
The ego vehicle and nearby obstacles remain mostly distant and exhibit limited immediate collision risk due to significant separation and stationary nature of several obstacles. No collision has been observed historically, nor anticipated based on current trajectories and velocities. None of the obstacles have an overall risk score indicating collision or extreme risk.
