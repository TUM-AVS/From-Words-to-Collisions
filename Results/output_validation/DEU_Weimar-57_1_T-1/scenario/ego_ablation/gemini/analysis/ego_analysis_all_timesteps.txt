Obstacle 17 is behind the ego vehicle and laterally aligned with it, with a longitudinal distance of 0.00 meters.  The relative velocity indicates that Obstacle 17 is approaching the ego vehicle longitudinally at 2.47 m/s. Given the zero longitudinal distance and the approaching velocity, a collision is imminent in the next timestep.

Obstacle 25 is located to the rear-left of the ego vehicle. Its longitudinal distance is -6.21 meters, and its lateral distance is 6.66 meters. Although it is moving toward the ego vehicle both longitudinally (1.46 m/s) and laterally (-1.13 m/sâ€”towards the left, from the ego's perspective), the distances and relative velocities do not indicate an immediate risk of collision.
