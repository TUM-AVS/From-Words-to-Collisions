At t=9.2s, Obstacle 17 is in the Left of the ego car with a longitudinal distance of 0.00 m and a lateral distance of 1.13 m. It has a relative longitudinal velocity of 2.47 m/s and lateral velocity of -1.90 m/s, indicating it's moving towards the ego car from behind and laterally from the left.  The relative longitudinal acceleration is -1.53 m/s² and lateral acceleration is -0.20 m/s². This suggests a potential collision risk as the obstacle is very close laterally and approaching rapidly from behind. Obstacle 25 is behind and to the left of the ego but at a greater distance and with a lower longitudinal velocity than Obstacle 17. Therefore it presents a lower risk than Obstacle 17. Obstacle 48 has moved significantly longitudinally and laterally away from the ego, indicating negligible risk. Other obstacles are static or further away. Obstacle 17 poses the most immediate risk due to its close proximity, high relative longitudinal velocity, and position to the left of the ego.

**Risk Levels and Definitions:**
<Collision (Score: 0)>: Actual collision has occurred or is unavoidable within the next timestep.
<Extreme Risk (Score: 1)>: Immediate collision or very high likelihood of impact. Urgent action is required.
<High Risk (Score: 2)>: Close to collision or highly probable collision path. Needs prompt attention and quick manoeuvring.
<Medium Risk (Score: 3)>: Moderate collision risk but manageable with timely reactions and proper strategies.
<Low Risk (Score: 4)>: Minimal collision risk. The situation is controllable with sufficient time to react.
<Negligible Risk (Score: 5)>: No significant collision risk. Obstacles are either moving away or far enough not to interfere.

    "IsCollisionScenario": false,
    "Reasoning": "Obstacle 17 poses an extreme risk due to its proximity to the ego vehicle, high relative longitudinal velocity, and position to the left of the ego, indicating a very high likelihood of collision in the next few timesteps. Although no collision has occurred yet, the scenario warrants immediate attention and evasive action."
