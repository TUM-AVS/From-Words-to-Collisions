Let me analyze each obstacle at the most recent timestep (9.2 seconds) with trajectory context from previous timesteps:

1. Obstacle 0 (Front-right):
   - Adjusted distances: longitudinal 12.77m, lateral -12.30m
   - Relative velocity: 0m/s in both dimensions
   - MDC: min(12.77, 12.30) = 12.30m (No Risk - 5)
   - TTC: N/A (not approaching)
   - Risk: 5

2. Obstacle 8 (Front-right):
   - Adjusted distances: longitudinal 18.96m, lateral -16.54m
   - Relative velocity: 0m/s in both dimensions
   - MDC: min(18.96, 16.54) = 16.54m (No Risk - 5)
   - TTC: N/A
   - Risk: 5

3. Obstacle 17 (Left - critical):
   - Adjusted distances: longitudinal 0.00m, lateral 1.13m
   - Relative velocity: longitudinal 2.47m/s, lateral -1.90m/s
   - MDC: lateral 1.13m (High Risk - 2)
   - TTC (lateral): 1.13/1.90 = 0.59s (High Risk - 2)
   - Previous timesteps show consistent lateral approach from left
   - Risk: 2 (High)

4. Obstacle 19 (Front-left):
   - Adjusted distances: longitudinal 8.16m, lateral 1.33m
   - Relative velocity: 0m/s in both dimensions
   - MDC: min(8.16, 1.33) = 1.33m (Medium Risk - 3)
   - TTC: N/A
   - Risk: 3

5. Obstacle 22 (Front-left):
   - Adjusted distances: longitudinal 12.47m, lateral 7.48m
   - Relative velocity: 0m/s in both dimensions
   - MDC: min(12.47, 7.48) = 7.48m (Low Risk - 4)
   - TTC: N/A
   - Risk: 4

6. Obstacle 25 (Rear-left):
   - Adjusted distances: longitudinal -6.21m, lateral 6.66m
   - Relative velocity: longitudinal 1.46m/s, lateral -1.13m/s
   - MDC: min(6.21, 6.66) = 6.21m (Low Risk - 4)
   - TTC (longitudinal): 6.21/1.46 = 4.25s (Low Risk - 4)
   - Risk: 4

7. Obstacle 31 (Front-left):
   - Adjusted distances: longitudinal 16.53m, lateral 13.78m
   - Relative velocity: 0m/s in both dimensions
   - MDC: min(16.53, 13.78) = 13.78m (No Risk - 5)
   - TTC: N/A
   - Risk: 5

8. Obstacle 32 (Rear-left):
   - Adjusted distances: longitudinal -12.85m, lateral 11.79m
   - Relative velocity: longitudinal 0.77m/s, lateral -0.59m/s
   - MDC: min(12.85, 11.79) = 11.79m (No Risk - 5)
   - TTC (longitudinal): 12.85/0.77 = 16.69s (No Risk - 5)
   - Risk: 5

9. Obstacle 48 (Front-left):
   - Adjusted distances: longitudinal 17.66m, lateral 8.98m
   - Relative velocity: longitudinal 6.82m/s (moving away), lateral 10.70m/s (moving away)
   - MDC: min(17.66, 8.98) = 8.98m (Low Risk - 4)
   - TTC: N/A (diverging paths)
   - Risk: 5

Collision Scenario Determination:
- No obstacles have risk score 0 (collision)
- No obstacles have risk score 1 (extreme risk)
- Highest risk is Obstacle 17 with score 2 (High Risk)
- This is NOT a collision scenario

Final JSON Summary:
```json
{
    "CollisionObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "None",
        "OverallRiskScore": "None"
    },
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "None",
        "OverallRiskScore": "None"
    },
    "IsCollisionScenario": false,
    "Justification": "No obstacles have collision (0) or extreme risk (1) scores. Highest risk is Obstacle 17 with High Risk (2) due to lateral approach at 1.13m with TTC 0.59s."
}
