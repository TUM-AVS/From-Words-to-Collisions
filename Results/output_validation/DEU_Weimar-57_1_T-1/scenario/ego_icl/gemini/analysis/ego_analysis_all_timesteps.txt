Obstacle 0: Located in the Front-right of the ego vehicle.  Longitudinal distance is 12.77m and lateral distance is -12.30m. Relative velocities are both 0.00 m/s.  Given the distances and stationary relative velocity, there is no immediate risk of collision. Trajectory analysis shows this obstacle and ego vehicle may be at a standstill relative to each other. Risk score: 5 (No Risk)

Obstacle 8: Located Front-right. Longitudinal distance is 18.96m, lateral distance is -16.54m.  Relative velocities are both 0 m/s. This obstacle is also likely stationary relative to the ego vehicle, posing no immediate risk. Risk score: 5 (No Risk)

Obstacle 17: Located Left of the ego, with a longitudinal distance of 0.00m and a lateral distance of 1.13m. While longitudinally aligned, the lateral distance is significant. The motion description indicates Obstacle 17 is driving toward the ego car laterally from the left with a negative lateral velocity (-1.90 m/s). This indicates the obstacle is passing by and the lateral distance is increasing. Thus, even though they are longitudinally aligned, the relative motion suggests they will not collide.  Risk score: 3 (Medium Risk) - due to proximity. 

Obstacle 19: Located Front-left. Longitudinal distance 8.16m, lateral distance 1.33m. Relative velocities are both 0 m/s.  No immediate collision risk, appears stationary relative to ego. Risk score: 5 (No Risk)

Obstacle 22:  Located Front-left. Longitudinal distance 12.47m, lateral distance 7.48m. Relative velocities are 0 m/s. No immediate risk, likely stationary relative to ego. Risk score: 5 (No Risk)

Obstacle 25: Located Rear-left. Longitudinal distance -6.21m, lateral distance 6.66m. Relative longitudinal velocity 1.46 m/s, lateral velocity -1.13 m/s.  This obstacle is approaching from behind and the left, but the distances are significant enough to not pose an immediate threat. The trajectory across timesteps suggests it might be changing lanes but not in a way that leads to an immediate collision. Risk score: 4 (Low Risk)

Obstacle 31: Located Front-left. Longitudinal distance 16.53m, lateral distance 13.78m.  Relative velocities are 0. No immediate risk. Risk score: 5 (No Risk)


Obstacle 32: Located Rear-left. Longitudinal distance -12.85m, lateral distance 11.79m.  Relative longitudinal velocity 0.77 m/s, lateral velocity -0.59 m/s.  This obstacle is approaching from behind and slightly to the left, but at a slow velocity and with sufficient distance to not pose an immediate risk. Risk score: 5 (No Risk).

Obstacle 48: Located Front-left. Longitudinal distance 17.66m, lateral distance 8.98m. Relative longitudinal velocity is 6.82m/s (moving away from the ego vehicle longitudinally), lateral velocity is 10.70m/s (moving away laterally).  No risk of collision as the obstacle is moving away in both directions. Risk score: 5 (No Risk)

Conclusion: This is NOT a collision scenario. No obstacle poses an immediate collision risk.
