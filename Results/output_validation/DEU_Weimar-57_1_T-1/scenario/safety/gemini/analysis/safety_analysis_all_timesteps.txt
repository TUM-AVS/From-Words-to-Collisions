### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
    - Obstacle ID: 0
    - Relative Direction: Front-right
    - Distance Risk Reason: Obstacle is longitudinally far (>5m) but laterally moderately close (between 3m and 5m and closing in slightly over time). Considering the front-right direction, the lateral distance is weighted more importantly hence DSC is 4.
    - Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 5
    - Lateral Distance Safety Score: 4
    - Overall Distance Safety Score: 4.5
    - Time Risk Reason: Large TTClong and TTClat imply negligible longitudinal and lateral risk.
    - Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 5
    - Lateral Time Safety Score: 5
    - Overall Time Safety Score: 5.0
    - Overall Risk Score: 5

    - Obstacle ID: 8
    - Relative Direction: Front-right
    - Distance Risk Reason: Obstacle is longitudinally and laterally far (>5m). Negligible risk overall.
    - Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 5
    - Lateral Distance Safety Score: 5
    - Overall Distance Safety Score: 5
    - Time Risk Reason: Large TTClong and TTClat imply negligible longitudinal and lateral risk.
    - Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 5
    - Lateral Time Safety Score: 5
    - Overall Time Safety Score: 5.0
    - Overall Risk Score: 5

    - Obstacle ID: 17
    - Relative Direction: Left
    - Distance Risk Reason:  Obstacle is longitudinally very close (almost colliding) and laterally close (<=0.5m). The lateral component dominates due to Left direction.
    - Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 0
    - Lateral Distance Safety Score: 1
    - Overall Distance Safety Score: 1.0
    - Time Risk Reason: TTClong is 0 and TTClat is less than 0.5 suggesting extreme risk. Lateral component dominates due to the relative Left direction
    - Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 0
    - Lateral Time Safety Score: 1
    - Overall Time Safety Score: 1.0
    - Overall Risk Score: 1
