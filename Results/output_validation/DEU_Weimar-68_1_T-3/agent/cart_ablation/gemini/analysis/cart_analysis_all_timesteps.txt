Here's the collision risk analysis based on the provided Cartesian coordinate data:

**Analysis:**

* **Obstacle 6 & 9:**  These obstacles are stationary and far from the ego vehicle, posing no immediate threat. Risk score: 5 (Negligible Risk)

* **Obstacle 60:** This obstacle shares the same lanelet (2349) as the ego vehicle and is moving with increasing acceleration towards the ego vehicle.  Although there is no collision in the near future,  the risk score is 3 (Medium Risk). It needs attention and there is still sufficient time to react.

* **Obstacle 62 & 64:** These obstacles are in a different lanelet (2352) and are moving relatively slowly. Risk score: 4 (Low Risk).

* **Obstacle 65 & 71:** These obstacles are in different lanelets and moving fast but away from the ego vehicle and do not pose an immediate threat.  Risk score: 5 (Negligible Risk)

* **Obstacle 74:** This obstacle is in a different lanelet and far from the ego vehicle. Risk score: 5 (Negligible Risk).

* **Obstacle 92:**  This obstacle is far and not a collision risk currently. Risk score: 5 (Negligible Risk).
