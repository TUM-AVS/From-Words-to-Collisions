Obstacles 6.0 and 9.0 are stationary and far from the ego vehicle, posing no risk. Obstacle 60.0 is in the same lane as the ego vehicle (2349) and rapidly accelerating towards the ego while the ego is decelerating. This presents a high risk of collision. Obstacles 62.0 and 64.0 are in a different lane (2352) and don't appear to pose an immediate threat. Obstacle 65.0, 71.0, 74.0 and 92.0 are in different lanelets and moving away from the ego vehicle, thus present low risk.
