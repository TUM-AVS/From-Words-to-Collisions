To determine the risk level for each obstacle relative to the ego vehicle, I evaluated the movement trends and relative positions at the last timestep (9.4 seconds).

### Analysis:
1. **Obstacle 60.0**:
   - **Position**: (8.9786, -12.7733) in the same lanelet 2349.0 with the ego at (6.7971, -8.1129).
   - **Velocity**: 2.6811 m/s, increasing over time (started at 0.9722 m/s at 8.5s).
   - **Approaching**: Closing in on the ego with increasing speed, close relative positioning could suggest a collision trajectory.
   - **Risk**: Definitely a high-risk scenario needing urgent action. **High Risk (2)**

2. **Obstacle 71.0**:
   - **Position**: (16.5411, 5.405) in lanelet 2344.0, not directly interacting with the ego vehicle.
   - **Velocity**: 13.0808 m/s, on a different path.
   - **Approaching**: No meaningful direct interaction.
   - **Risk**: Negligible risk. **Negligible Risk (5)**

3. **Other Obstacles (6.0, 9.0, 62.0, 64.0, 74.0, 92.0)**:
   - All positioned significantly away from the ego vehicle spatially or are not on a collision trajectory given their paths.
   - These do not pose an immediate threat to the ego vehicle.
   - **Risk**: Low or negligible risk.

No obstacles have been identified with risk scores of 0 or 1 based on their current trajectories and velocities.
