At timestamp 9.4 seconds, the following obstacles are present:

* **Obstacle 6:** Located front-left, longitudinally 15.69m and laterally 1.16m.  No collision risk. Negligible risk (5).

* **Obstacle 9:** Located front-left, longitudinally 23.16m and laterally 0.48m. No collision risk. Negligible risk (5).

* **Obstacle 60:** Located behind, longitudinally -0.64m.  The negative longitudinal distance indicates that Obstacle 60 is close behind the ego vehicle, presenting a possible collision risk. Since the MDC is less than 0.5m but no collision happened, and the description states Obstacle 60 is *driving toward* the ego vehicle, this suggests a very high probability of imminent collision.  Extreme Risk (1).

* **Obstacle 62:** Located behind, longitudinally -9.41m. No immediate collision risk. Negligible risk (5).

* **Obstacle 64:** Located behind, longitudinally -17.64m. No immediate collision risk. Negligible risk (5).

* **Obstacle 71:** Located front-right, longitudinally 3.89m and laterally -12.78m.  No immediate collision risk. Low Risk (4).

* **Obstacle 74:** Located front-left, longitudinally 4.58m and laterally 8.85m. No immediate collision risk. Low Risk (4).

* **Obstacle 92:** Located front-left, longitudinally 5.76m and laterally 21.67m. No immediate collision risk. Negligible Risk (5).
