At timestamp 9.4 seconds, the following obstacles are present:

* **Obstacle 6:** Front-left, longitudinal distance 15.69 m, lateral distance 1.16 m.  Low risk (5) due to sufficient distance.

* **Obstacle 9:** Front-left, longitudinal distance 23.16 m, lateral distance 0.48 m. Low risk (5) due to sufficient distance.

* **Obstacle 60:** Behind, longitudinal distance -0.64 m.  High risk (2) due to very close proximity behind the ego vehicle. Approaching at 2.67 m/s. Collision likely in next time step.

* **Obstacle 62:** Behind, longitudinal distance -9.41 m. Medium risk (3) given the distance and closing velocity. Requires monitoring.

* **Obstacle 64:** Behind, longitudinal distance -17.64 m.  Low risk (5) due to distance.

* **Obstacle 71:** Front-right, longitudinal distance 3.89 m, lateral distance -12.78 m. Medium risk (3) â€“ Moderately close longitudinally but moving away laterally.

* **Obstacle 74:** Front-left, longitudinal distance 4.58 m, lateral distance 8.85 m. Medium risk (3) due to the short distance.

* **Obstacle 92:** Front-left, longitudinal distance 5.76 m, lateral distance 21.67 m. Medium risk (3) due to moderate longitudinal distance and lateral motion.

Risk Levels:
0: Collision - Physical contact occurred or unavoidable
1: Extreme Risk - Immediate collision likely
2: High Risk - Close to collision, needs quick action
3: Medium Risk - Manageable with proper reaction
4: Low Risk - Minimal risk, sufficient time to react
5: Negligible Risk - No significant risk
