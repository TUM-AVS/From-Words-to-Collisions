### Safety analysis for timestep 9.4s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

First, we need to acknowledge that while the prompt mentions "adjusted distances," these values are not provided in the scenario context.  Therefore, we will perform the analysis using the provided real distances (DTClong, DTClat), recognizing that the analysis would be more accurate with adjusted values.  We will make assumptions about ego vehicle size to try and compensate.

**Assumptions:**  Ego vehicle length = 4.5 meters, width = 2 meters. We'll use these to roughly estimate potential collision points.

**Methodology:**  Given the lack of adjusted distances, we will focus heavily on relative velocities and accelerations in conjunction with raw distances. We'll estimate TTC by dividing distance by closing velocity, assuming constant velocity.  This is a simplification but useful given the data available.


### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 6**
