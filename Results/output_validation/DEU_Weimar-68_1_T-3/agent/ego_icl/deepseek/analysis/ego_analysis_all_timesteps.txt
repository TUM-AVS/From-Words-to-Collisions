Let me analyze the obstacles at the most recent timestep (9.4 seconds) and assess collision risks:

1. Obstacle 6 (Front-left):
   - Longitudinal: 15.69m (approaching at -0.01m/s)
   - Lateral: 1.16m (stable)
   - MDC: 15.69m (longitudinal dominates)
   - TTC: Not applicable (very slow approach)
   - Risk: 5 (Negligible)

2. Obstacle 9 (Front-left):
   - Longitudinal: 23.16m (approaching at -0.01m/s)
   - Lateral: 0.48m (stable)
   - MDC: 23.16m
   - TTC: Not applicable
   - Risk: 5 (Negligible)

3. Obstacle 60 (Behind):
   - Longitudinal: -0.64m (approaching at 2.67m/s)
   - Lateral: 0.00m (aligned)
   - MDC: 0.64m
   - TTC: 0.64/2.67 = 0.24s
   - Risk: 1 (Extreme Risk - imminent rear collision)

4. Obstacle 62 (Behind):
   - Longitudinal: -9.41m (approaching at 1.43m/s)
   - Lateral: 0.00m
   - MDC: 9.41m
   - TTC: 6.58s
   - Risk: 4 (Low Risk)

5. Obstacle 64 (Behind):
   - Longitudinal: -17.64m (approaching at 0.71m/s)
   - Lateral: 0.00m
   - MDC: 17.64m
   - TTC: 24.85s
   - Risk: 5 (Negligible)

6. Obstacle 71 (Front-right):
   - Longitudinal: 3.89m (approaching at -1.26m/s)
   - Lateral: -12.78m (moving away at -13.02m/s)
   - MDC: 12.78m (lateral dominates)
   - TTC: Not applicable (diverging)
   - Risk: 5 (Negligible)

7. Obstacle 74 (Front-left):
   - Longitudinal: 4.58m (approaching at -0.19m/s)
   - Lateral: 8.85m (approaching at -2.56m/s)
   - MDC: 8.85m
   - TTC: 3.46s (lateral)
   - Risk: 3 (Medium Risk)

8. Obstacle 92 (Front-left):
   - Longitudinal: 5.76m (approaching at -0.44m/s)
   - Lateral: 21.67m (approaching at -4.41m/s)
   - MDC: 21.67m
   - TTC: 4.91s
   - Risk: 4 (Low Risk)

Trajectory Analysis:
- Obstacle 60 is rapidly approaching from behind (2.67m/s) and will reach the ego vehicle in 0.24 seconds
- All other obstacles are either moving away or at safe distances
- Obstacle 60 shows consistent acceleration toward the ego vehicle across timesteps

```json
{
    "CollisionObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "60",
        "OverallRiskScore": "1"
    },
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "60",
        "OverallRiskScore": "1"
    },
    "PredictedCollisionObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "60",
        "OverallRiskScore": "1"
    }
}
```

Note: While no collision has occurred yet (score 0), Obstacle 60 presents an extreme risk (score 1) and is predicted to collide imminently if trajectories continue.
