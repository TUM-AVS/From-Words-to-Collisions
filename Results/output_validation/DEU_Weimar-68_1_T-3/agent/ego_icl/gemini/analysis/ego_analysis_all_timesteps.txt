* **Obstacle 6:** Front-Left, longitudinal 15.69m, lateral 1.16m.  Relative velocity is negligible in both directions.  Trajectory analysis shows Obstacle 6 generally maintains a safe distance. Risk level: 5 (Negligible Risk).

* **Obstacle 9:** Front-Left, longitudinal 23.16m, lateral 0.48m. Relative velocity is negligible. Trajectory shows it maintaining a safe distance. Risk level: 5 (Negligible Risk)

* **Obstacle 60:** Behind, longitudinal -0.64m, lateral 0.00m.  High closing velocity (2.67 m/s). The obstacle is very close longitudinally and rapidly approaching.  TTC = 0.64/2.67 = 0.24s. MDC is approximately 0.64m. This represents an *extreme risk*. Risk level: 1 (Extreme Risk)

* **Obstacle 62:** Behind, longitudinal -9.41m, lateral 0.00m.  Closing velocity of 1.43 m/s. TTC = 9.41 / 1.43 ≈ 6.58s. MDC ≈ 9.41m. Risk level: 5 (Negligible Risk)

* **Obstacle 64:** Behind, longitudinal -17.64m, lateral 0.00m. Closing velocity of 0.71 m/s. TTC = 17.64 / 0.71 ≈ 24.85s. MDC ≈ 17.64m. Risk level: 5 (Negligible Risk)

* **Obstacle 71:** Front-Right, longitudinal 3.89m, lateral -12.78m. Moving away laterally. Longitudinal closing velocity of 1.26 m/s. TTC = 3.89 / 1.26 ≈ 3.09s. MDC is difficult to assess precisely without detailed trajectory projections, but given the lateral movement, it's unlikely to be less than 3.89m. Risk level: 4 (Low Risk)

* **Obstacle 74:** Front-Left, longitudinal 4.58m, lateral 8.85m.  Slow longitudinal closing velocity (-0.19m/s), moderate lateral closing velocity (-2.56m/s).  TTC longitudinally is 4.58 / 0.19 = 24.1s. TTC laterally is 8.85/2.56 = 3.45.  MDC can be estimated around 4.58m.  Risk level: 4 (Low Risk)

* **Obstacle 92:** Front-Left, longitudinal 5.76m, lateral 21.67m. Moderate lateral closing velocity (-4.41m/s), slow longitudinal closing velocity (-0.44m/s). TTC longitudinally is 5.76/0.44 = 13.09s. TTC laterally is 21.67/4.41 = 4.9s. MDC is 5.76m. Risk level: 4 (Low Risk).
