### Analysis of Each Obstacle

**Obstacle 6:**
- Position: Front-left
- Adjusted Longitudinal Distance: 15.69m, Adjusted Lateral Distance: 1.16m
- Relative Velocity: Longitudinal -0.01m/s, Lateral 0.00m/s
- Motion: Driving toward ego longitudinally, no lateral motion.
- **Longitudinal TTC**: Not applicable due to negligible relative velocity.
- **Lateral TTC**: Not applicable due to no lateral velocity.
- **MDC**: Given distances, MDC falls within low risk. 
- **Risk Level**: 4 (Low Risk)

**Obstacle 9:**
- Position: Front-left
- Adjusted Longitudinal Distance: 23.16m, Adjusted Lateral Distance: 0.48m
- Relative Velocity: Longitudinal -0.01m/s, Lateral 0.00m/s
- Motion: Driving toward ego longitudinally, exact alignment lateral.
- **Longitudinal TTC**: Not applicable due to negligible relative velocity.
- **MDC**: Given distances, MDC would minimally fall under low but purely aligned without collision possibility.
- **Risk Level**: 4 (Low Risk)

**Obstacle 60:**
- Position: Rear
- Adjusted Longitudinal Distance: -0.64m
- Relative Velocity: Longitudinal 2.67m/s (closing), Lateral 0.05m/s
- Motion: Driving toward ego from behind.
- **Longitudinal TTC**: 0.64 / 2.67 = 0.24 sec
- **MDC**: Typically nonexistent due to negative longitudinal alignment.
- **Risk Level**: 1 (Extreme Risk)

**Obstacle 62:**
- Position: Rear
- Adjusted Longitudinal Distance: -9.41m
- Relative Velocity: Longitudinal 1.43m/s, Lateral 0.03m/s 
- Motion: Driving toward ego from behind.
- **Longitudinal TTC**: Not applicable; beyond the zone.
- **MDC**: Consistent with no immediate collision threat.
- **Risk Level**: 4 (Low Risk)

**Obstacle 64:**
- Position: Rear
- Adjusted Longitudinal Distance: -17.64m
- Relative Velocity: Longitudinal 0.71m/s, Lateral 0.01m/s 
- Motion: Driving toward ego from behind.
- **Longitudinal TTC**: Not applicable; well aligned.
- **MDC**: Largely negligible given distance.
- **Risk Level**: 5 (Negligible Risk)

**Obstacle 71:**
- Position: Front-right
- Adjusted Longitudinal Distance: 3.89m, Adjusted Lateral Distance: -12.78m
- Relative Velocity: Longitudinal -1.26m/s, Lateral -13.02m/s
- Motion: Moving away laterally to the right.
- **TTC Sum**: Neither TTC or MDC poses immediate concentration.
- **Risk Level**: 5 (Negligible Risk)

**Obstacle 74:**
- Position: Front-left
- Adjusted Longitudinal Distance: 4.58m, Adjusted Lateral Distance: 8.85m
- Relative Velocity: Longitudinal -0.19m/s, Lateral -2.56m/s
- Motion: Driving toward ego longitudinally.
- **TTC Longitudinal**: 4.58 / 0.19 = 24 seconds
- **TTC Lateral**: 8.85 / 2.56 = 3.46 seconds
- **MDC**: Edges to medium but more outside than real. 
- **Risk Level**: 4 (Low Risk)

**Obstacle 92:**
- Position: Front-left
- Adjusted Longitudinal Distance: 5.76m, Adjusted Lateral Distance: 21.67m
- Relative Velocity: Longitudinal -0.44m/s, Lateral -4.41m/s
- Motion: Longitudinal towards ego, lateral closing.
- **Longitudinal TTC**: 5.76/0.44 = 13 seconds
- **Lateral TTC**: 21.67/4.41 = 4.91 seconds
- **MDC**: Well above risk threshold
- **Risk Level**: 4 (Low Risk)
