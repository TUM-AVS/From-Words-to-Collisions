At t=9.6s, obstacle 60 shows the highest risk.  This obstacle shares the same lanelet (2349) as the ego vehicle.  Obstacle 60's position (8.7418, -12.2603) and velocity (2.9038) relative to the ego vehicle's position (6.7962, -8.111) and velocity (0.0152), combined with the acceleration values, indicate a likely collision within the very near future if both agents continue on their current trajectory. Although obstacle 60 is behind the ego vehicle, it is approaching at a high relative velocity.  Additionally, both the velocity and acceleration of obstacle 60 are increasing. Given these factors, a risk score of 1 is assigned.

All other obstacles are sufficiently far from the ego vehicle and do not present an immediate collision risk.
