### Safety Analysis for Most Recent Timestep (9.6s)

### Key Observations:
1. **Ego Vehicle**: 
   - Position: (6.7962, -8.1110)
   - Velocity: 0.0152 m/s (very slow)
   - Lanelet: 2349.0

2. **Obstacle Analysis**:
   - Most obstacles are either stationary or moving away from ego's position
   - Only obstacle 60 shows potential interaction (same lanelet 2349.0)
   - Obstacle 60 is at (8.7418, -12.2603) moving toward ego at 2.9038 m/s

### Detailed Obstacle Assessment:

#### Obstacle 60 (Most Relevant):
- **Distance Risk**: 
  - Current distance: ~4.2m from ego (Euclidean)
  - Same lanelet (2349.0) and approaching
  - Distance safety score: 2 (High Risk)
- **Time Risk**: 
  - TTC: ~1.45s (4.2m / 2.9m/s)
  - Time safety score: 2 (High Risk)
- **Overall Risk**: 2 (High Risk but not imminent collision)

#### Other Obstacles:
- All other obstacles are either:
  - In different lanelets
  - Moving away from ego
  - Stationary
  - At significant distances (>50m)
- Typical scores: 4-5 (Low-Negligible Risk)

### Chain of Thought:
1. Ego is nearly stationary (0.015m/s)
2. Only obstacle 60 is in same lanelet and approaching
3. Current distance (4.2m) and TTC (1.45s) don't indicate immediate collision
4. No obstacles show collision or extreme risk at this timestep
5. Historical data shows consistent trajectories without collision course
