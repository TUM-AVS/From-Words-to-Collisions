- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 9
- Distance Risk reason: Far away from ego vehicle and stationary.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Stationary. No risk of collision in the analyzed timeframe.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 60
- Distance Risk reason: In the same lanelet and rapidly approaching the ego vehicle from behind, poses a significant risk over the next few seconds.
- Distance safety score: 2
- Time Risk reason: High relative velocity and acceleration indicates imminent risk.
- Time safety score: 2
- Overall Risk score: 2

- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: Moving in the same general direction as the ego vehicle.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 3

- Obstacle ID: 64
- Distance Risk reason: Furthest obstacle.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Moving slowly.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- Obstacle ID: 71
- Distance Risk reason: Moving quickly but not towards ego.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Not approaching.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 4

- Obstacle ID: 74
- Distance Risk reason: Reasonably far.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Moving somewhat quickly, and lanelet indicates potential interaction with ego in the future.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3

- Obstacle ID: 92
- Distance Risk reason: Far away, poses no immediate threat.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Moving away from the ego vehicle.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
Obstacle 60 poses the most significant risk due to its high closing velocity towards the ego vehicle within the same lanelet.  While not an immediate collision, the rapid approach suggests a potential collision in the near future.  No other obstacle presents an immediate collision risk within the observed timeframe.

### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
  "CollisionObstacles": [],
  "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null,
  "ScenarioAnalysis": {
    "IsCollisionScenario": false,
    "Reasoning": "No obstacle has an overall risk score of 0, indicating no immediate collision. Obstacle 60 presents the highest risk (score 2) due to its high closing velocity in the same lane, but it's not an immediate collision."
  }
}
