### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 6.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: It has been stationary and is far from the ego vehicle, maintaining a consistent position.
  - Distance safety score: 5
  - Time Risk reason: No relative velocity or acceleration changes as the obstacle is stationary.
  - Time safety score: 5
  - Overall Risk score: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 9.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: Similar to obstacle 6.0; stationary and far away, with no change in position.
  - Distance safety score: 5
  - Time Risk reason: No relative motion or acceleration; stationary.
  - Time safety score: 5
  - Overall Risk score: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 60.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: Moving along the same lanelet as ego vehicle but at a safe distance. Increasing velocity suggests moving away slowly.
  - Distance safety score: 4
  - Time Risk reason: Acceleration is positive but not aggressive enough to suggest imminent collision.
  - Time safety score: 4
  - Overall Risk score: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 62.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: Shares the same trajectory but remains at a safe distance; slow velocity and accelerating slightly.
  - Distance safety score: 4
  - Time Risk reason: Gradually accelerating but currently poses minimal threat to ego's trajectory.
  - Time safety score: 4
  - Overall Risk score: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 64.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: Fairly static position over time, poses no immediate threat; slight change in position but slow velocity.
  - Distance safety score: 5
  - Time Risk reason: Minor acceleration; insufficient to impact collision probability in near term.
  - Time safety score: 5
  - Overall Risk score: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 71.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: Significant velocity and positive trajectory imply movement away from ego vehicle.
  - Distance safety score: 5
  - Time Risk reason: Consistent high speed with acceleration trending upwards, but away from ego.
  - Time safety score: 5
  - Overall Risk score: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 74.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: Offers no threat; reducing speed, moving laterally with a deceleration.
  - Distance safety score: 5
  - Time Risk reason: High deceleration reducing potential threat significantly.
  - Time safety score: 5
  - Overall Risk score: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 92.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: On a separate lanelet with moderate deceleration and a consistent trajectory away from ego vehicle.
  - Distance safety score: 5
  - Time Risk reason: Reduction in speed and consistent lateral displacement ensure no immediate risk.
  - Time safety score: 5
  - Overall Risk score: 5

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
Analyzed obstacles show no immediate threat of collision owing to their distance, velocity, and trajectory relative to the ego vehicle. No collision or extreme risk scenarios due to consistent patterns over analyzed timesteps, with obstacles either stationary or moving further from the ego vehicle.
