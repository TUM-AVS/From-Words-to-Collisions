Obstacle 60 is behind the ego vehicle and poses a high risk. It is very close longitudinally (-0.06m) and its relative longitudinal velocity (2.88 m/s) indicates it is approaching rapidly. Although lateral relative motion is not significant, the minimal longitudinal distance combined with the approaching speed raises serious concerns.

Obstacle 71 is in front-right of the ego vehicle, exhibiting medium risk. While it is relatively close longitudinally (2.09m) and approaching (-2.47 m/s), its lateral motion and distance (-16.09m and -13.19 m/s respectively) suggest it's moving away from the ego vehicle's path. This reduces the immediate risk, but the proximity still warrants attention.

Obstacle 74, located front-left, presents a medium risk. Its longitudinal distance (5.43m) is greater than that of Obstacle 71, but its lateral distance and velocity (7.63m and -1.65 m/s) indicate it is moving closer to the ego vehicle's path.  This lateral movement needs careful observation although the current longitudinal distance and velocity do not pose an immediate threat.
