Obstacle 60 is behind the ego vehicle and approaching rapidly. Its longitudinal distance is -0.06m, meaning it's very close.  A collision is imminent as its relative velocity is high (2.88 m/s) and closing.

Obstacle 71 is in front and to the right, moving away laterally but approaching longitudinally.  While its longitudinal distance is 2.09m, its high closing velocity (-2.47 m/s) makes it a high risk, potentially leading to a collision in the next few timesteps.
