### Safety analysis for timestep 8.7s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 6
- Distance Risk reason:  Large longitudinal and lateral distances (15.62m) and located front-left.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Very slow closing velocity (-0.02 m/s) implies a very large TTC if a collision were to occur.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 9
- Distance Risk reason: Large longitudinal and lateral distances (23.10m) and located front-left.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Very slow closing velocity (-0.02 m/s) implies a very large TTC if a collision were to occur.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 60
- Distance Risk reason: Very close longitudinal distance (-2.08m), meaning it's behind and close to the ego vehicle.
- Distance safety score: 1
- Time Risk reason: Closing velocity (1.33 m/s) from behind suggests a short time to collision if the ego vehicle brakes suddenly.
- Time safety score: 1
- Overall Risk score: 1

- Obstacle ID: 62
- Distance Risk reason: Moderately close longitudinal distance (-10.10m) from behind.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: Closing velocity (0.50 m/s) presents some risk, but there's still time to react.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3

- Obstacle ID: 64
- Distance Risk reason: Safe longitudinal distance (-17.98m) from behind.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Slow closing velocity (0.34 m/s) provides ample time to react.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- Obstacle ID: 71
- Distance Risk reason: Close longitudinal distance (4.82m) but moving away laterally (-11.71 m/s).
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: Although closing longitudinally (-0.51 m/s), the high lateral velocity significantly reduces collision risk.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- Obstacle ID: 74
- Distance Risk reason: Close longitudinal distance (4.42m) and lateral distance (4.42m).
- Distance safety score: 2
- Time Risk reason: Closing in both directions (-0.41 m/s longitudinally, -5.70 m/s laterally) poses a significant risk.
- Time safety score: 2
- Overall Risk score: 2

- Obstacle ID: 92
- Distance Risk reason: Close longitudinal distance (5.37m) and lateral distance (5.37m).
- Distance safety score: 2
- Time Risk reason: Closing in both directions (-0.44 m/s longitudinally, -6.07 m/s laterally) poses a significant risk.
- Time safety score: 2
- Overall Risk score: 2

### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
  "CollisionObstacle": {
    "ObstacleID": "60",
    "OverallRiskScore": "1"
  },
  "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {
      "ObstacleID": "60",
      "OverallRiskScore": "1"
  },
  "IsCollisionScenario": false,
  "Justification": "Obstacle 60 poses an extreme risk due to its very close proximity behind the ego vehicle and closing velocity. Although it represents a high risk situation requiring immediate attention, it's identified as 'extreme risk' and not a 'collision' as no actual impact is registered within the provided data. Continuous monitoring and appropriate evasive maneuvers are crucial. Other obstacles are not considered immediate collision risks based on their current trajectories and distances."
}
```
```
Important Notes:

* The above JSON represents a general structure. The "CollisionObstacle" field would only have an ID and score of 0 if a collision is actually observed (i.e., distance becomes effectively zero).  In the provided scenario, no actual collision is reported, even though Obstacle 60 gets extremely close.  This highlights the difference between "imminent risk" and "collision."
* The "ExtremeRiskObstacle" field highlights obstacles posing the most immediate danger, even if not yet a collision. 
* The justification explains the overall risk assessment, taking into account the most critical obstacles. 
* For each timestep, you'd repeat the individual obstacle analysis and then update the summary JSON accordingly, especially if a collision occurs or a new obstacle enters the extreme risk category.  
* Calculating precise TTC can be complex due to varying accelerations. For a simplified estimate, you can use `TTC = Distance / Relative Velocity`, but keep in mind this assumes constant velocity. More sophisticated methods consider acceleration and predict future trajectories for a more accurate assessment.


Remember that in a real-world scenario, these metrics are used in conjunction with other sensor data and decision-making algorithms to trigger appropriate safety responses. This breakdown provides a structured risk assessment based on the given information, allowing for a more informed analysis of the evolving situation.
