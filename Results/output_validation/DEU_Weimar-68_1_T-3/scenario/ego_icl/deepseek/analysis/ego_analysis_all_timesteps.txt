Let me analyze the most recent timestep (9.6 seconds) for collision risks:

Obstacle-by-obstacle analysis:

1. Obstacle 6 (Front):
   - Longitudinal: 15.86m (closing at -0.02m/s)
   - Lateral: 0.00m (aligned)
   - TTC: 15.86/0.02 = 793s (No Risk)
   - MDC: 15.86m (No Risk)
   - Risk: 5 (No Risk)

2. Obstacle 9 (Front):
   - Same as Obstacle 6
   - Risk: 5 (No Risk)

3. Obstacle 60 (Behind):
   - Longitudinal: -0.06m (closing at 2.88m/s)
   - Lateral: 0.00m (aligned)
   - TTC: 0.06/2.88 = 0.02s (Extreme Risk)
   - MDC: 0.06m (Extreme Risk)
   - Risk: 0 (Collision) - The vehicle is already overlapping with ego (negative distance) at high speed

4. Obstacle 62 (Behind):
   - Longitudinal: -9.04m (closing at 1.72m/s)
   - Lateral: 0.00m (aligned)
   - TTC: 9.04/1.72 = 5.26s (No Risk)
   - MDC: 9.04m (No Risk)
   - Risk: 5 (No Risk)

5. Obstacle 64 (Behind):
   - Similar to Obstacle 62 but slower approach
   - Risk: 5 (No Risk)

6. Obstacle 71 (Front-right):
   - Moving rapidly away laterally (-13.19m/s)
   - Risk: 5 (No Risk)

7. Obstacle 74 (Front-left):
   - Lateral distance 7.63m decreasing slowly
   - Risk: 5 (No Risk)

8. Obstacle 92 (Front-left):
   - Lateral distance 19.87m decreasing slowly
   - Risk: 5 (No Risk)

Trajectory Analysis:
- Obstacle 60 shows consistent rapid approach from behind (2.42m/s at 9.3s to 2.88m/s at 9.6s)
- By 9.6s it has already passed into negative longitudinal distance (-0.06m) indicating physical overlap
- All other obstacles maintain safe distances

This is clearly a collision scenario due to Obstacle 60.

```json
{
    "CollisionObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "60",
        "OverallRiskScore": "0"
    },
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null,
    "IsCollisionScenario": true,
    "Justification": "Obstacle 60 has physically overlapped with ego vehicle (negative longitudinal distance of -0.06m) while approaching at 2.88m/s, indicating an active collision"
}
