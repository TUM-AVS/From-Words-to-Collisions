## Obstacle-by-Obstacle Analysis

**Obstacle 6**
- **Position:** Front-left
- **Last Recorded Distances:** Longitudinal = 15.86 m, Lateral = 0.00 m
- **Velocities:** Longitudinal = -0.02 m/s, Lateral = 0.00 m/s
- **Trajectory:** Minor changes in position; primarily maintaining a steady approach with a very slight closing velocity.
- **TTC Calculation:** Since the relative longitudinal velocity is very low (-0.02 m/s) and positive indicating closing velocity, the TTC is not significant. Effective TTC is essentially impractical due to small velocity.
- **MDC:**
  - Assuming negligible velocity changes, MDC reflects the minimal distance (0.00 m for lateral since direct alignment).
  - Given longitudinal separation is large (15.86 m), there's **No Risk** (score = 5).

**Obstacle 9**
- **Position:** Front
- **Last Recorded Distances:** Longitudinal = 23.24 m, Lateral = 0.00 m
- **Velocities:** Longitudinal = -0.02 m/s, Lateral = 0.00 m/s
- **Trajectory:** Stable distances and stable velocities indicate no significant risk trend.
- **TTC Calculation:** Similar to obstacle 6, the low closing velocity results in a near infinite TTC.
- **MDC:** Large longitudinal separation ensures **No Risk** (score = 5).

**Obstacle 60**
- **Position:** Behind
- **Last Recorded Distances:** Longitudinal = -0.06 m
- **Velocities:** Longitudinal = 2.88 m/s, Lateral = -0.20 m/s
- **Trajectory:** Rapid closing from behind with a significant longitudinal velocity; steadily decreasing longitudinal distance across previous readings.
- **TTC Calculation:** \( \frac{0.06}{2.88} \approx 0.02 \) seconds (TTC for collision is extremely low).
- **MDC:** Already effectively 0 longitudinal and closing.
- **Risk Analysis:** With a TTC < 0.5s and MDC near zero, this is an **Extreme Risk** (score = 1).

**Obstacle 62, 64**
- **Position:** Behind
- **Last Recorded Distances:** Longitudinal = -9.04 m (62), -17.41 m (64)
- **Velocities:** 1.72 m/s (62), 0.96 m/s (64)
- **Trajectory:** Closing from behind; however, the time-to-reach close MDC is long due to substantial distances.
- **TTC Calculation:** Each has a TTC > 5 seconds suggesting a **Low Risk** assumption.
- **MDC:** Large separation means **No Risk** (score = 5).

**Obstacle 71**
- **Position:** Front-right
- **Last Recorded Distances:** Longitudinal = 2.09 m, Lateral = -16.09 m
- **Velocities:** Longitudinal = -2.47 m/s, Lateral = -13.19 m/s
- **Trajectory:** Moving diagonally but primarily away laterally.
- **TTC Calculation:** Longitudinal TTC feasible, but lateral already implies divergence.
- **MDC:** Distance increase laterally signifies **No Risk** (score = 5).

**Obstacle 74, 92**
- **Position:** Front-left
- **Last Recorded Distances:** 5.43 m / 7.63 m longitudinal and 7.63 m / 19.87 m lateral
- **Velocities:** Closing minimally longitudinally and significantly closing laterally; however, lateral distances are still large.
- **TTC Calculation:** Longitudinal separation already suggests non-immediate concern.
- **MDC:** Although lateral separation decreases upon each interval, both have a **Low Risk** score due to larger minimum distances.

## Collision Determination
Despite numerous obstacles close and aligning, only Obstacle 60 has an Extreme Risk collision potential due to its high approach velocity from behind resulting in near zero TTC and MDC.
