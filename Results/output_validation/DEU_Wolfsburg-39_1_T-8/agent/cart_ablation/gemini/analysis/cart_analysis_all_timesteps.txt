Here's the collision risk analysis:

**Analysis:**

The Ego vehicle (20151.0) starts at (28.9958, 103.068) and moves with a decreasing velocity and varying acceleration.  It generally appears to be slowing down. All obstacles and Ego are in the same lanelet (2039.0).

* **Obstacle 20135.0:** Stationary far behind Ego, no risk.
* **Obstacle 20137.0:** Stationary far behind Ego, no risk.
* **Obstacle 20141.0:**  Stationary far behind Ego, no risk.
* **Obstacle 20148.0:** Moving slower than Ego in the same general direction. Starts somewhat close behind Ego. The distance between Ego and Obstacle 20148.0 is large enough, with decreasing velocities considered, the likelihood of collision is medium.
* **Obstacle 20155.0:** Moving with nearly constant velocity in the same direction as Ego, and ahead of Ego.  It does not pose a risk.

Considering the current positions, velocities, and accelerations, no immediate collisions are detected. Though Object 20148 is moving slower than Ego and the distance between them is decreasing, the gap does not indicate a collision risk within the next immediate timestep, considering their current accelerations and velocities, nor an extreme risk in the near future.
