Here's the analysis of the provided scenario:

**Ego Vehicle (20151.0):** The ego vehicle is decelerating significantly over the observed time steps. This deceleration is important to consider relative to the other vehicles' behaviors.

**Obstacle 20135.0 and 20137.0:** These obstacles are stationary and pose no immediate threat based on the current trajectories. They are far behind the ego vehicle. Risk Score: 5 (Negligible Risk)

**Obstacle 20141.0:** This obstacle is moving slowly and decelerating. It's also quite far behind the ego vehicle, and the distance is increasing due to the ego vehicle's higher speed (even while decelerating). Risk Score: 5 (Negligible Risk)

**Obstacle 20148.0:**  This obstacle is moving at a moderate speed and decelerating. While it is closer to the ego vehicle than the previous obstacles, the distance between them appears to be increasing, lessening the risk of a collision.  Risk Score: 4 (Low Risk)

**Obstacle 20155.0:** This obstacle is moving at a speed similar to the ego vehicle initially, but the ego vehicle is decelerating. Obstacle 20155.0 is also located significantly ahead of the ego vehicle and there's no indication of a closing trajectory that would lead to a collision. Risk Score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
