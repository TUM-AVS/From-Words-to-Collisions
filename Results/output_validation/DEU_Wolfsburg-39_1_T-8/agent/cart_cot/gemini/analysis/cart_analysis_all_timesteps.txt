At t=0.5s, Ego continues decelerating while moving roughly parallel to the obstacles in the same lanelet.  Obstacle 20148 is the closest, and though it is also decelerating, its x-coordinate and overall trajectory still present a medium risk. No obstacles pose an extreme or imminent collision risk.
