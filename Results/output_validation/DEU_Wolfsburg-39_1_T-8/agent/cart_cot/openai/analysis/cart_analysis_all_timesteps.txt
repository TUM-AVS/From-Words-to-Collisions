### Brief analysis for risky obstacles:

At the most recent timestamp (0.5 seconds), we focus on each obstacle's position and velocity relative to the ego vehicle. Here's a brief analysis of potential high-risk situations:

1. **Ego Vehicle Analysis:**
   - Position: (27.0365, 97.7897)
   - Velocity: 7.5176 m/s 
   - Continuously decelerating, indicating potential braking or emergency stop.

2. **Obstacle 20148.0:**
   - Position: (25.0769, 92.5114)
   - Velocity: 8.4739 m/s
   - This obstacle is fast approaching the ego's trajectory path. With a relative distance of approximately 5.4 meters and a closing speed, this is a potential high-risk scenario requiring urgent action to avoid a collision.

3. **Obstacle 20141.0:**
   - Position: (22.5488, 85.7009)
   - Velocity: 1.7795 m/s
   - Although slower, its proximity to the ego's current path raises a medium risk, but it is lower compared to Obstacle 20148.0 due to lower speed and distance.

In summary, the primary immediate concern is the obstacle 20148.0 due to its proximity and higher relative speed, indicating a high-risk collision that might occur if no further actions are taken such as changing speed or direction aggressively.

```json
{
    "CollisionObstacles": [],
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {},
    "HighRiskObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "20148.0",
        "OverallRiskScore": 2
    }
}
``` 

The JSON object indicates the identified obstacle with the highest risk level of 2, categorized under "HighRiskObstacle." The collision risk does not fall into extreme or unavoidable (0 or 1) category in this scenario, hence those are represented as empty.
