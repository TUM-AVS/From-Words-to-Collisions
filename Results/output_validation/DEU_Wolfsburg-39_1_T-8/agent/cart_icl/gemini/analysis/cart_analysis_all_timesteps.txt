At t=0.5s, Ego continues decelerating while moving forward. Obstacle 20135, 20137, 20141, 20148, and 20155 maintain their general motion trends. Obstacles 20135 and 20137 are stationary. Obstacle 20141 continues decelerating but remains far behind and poses negligible risk. Obstacle 20148 continues to decelerate but is still somewhat close to the ego vehicle. Obstacle 20155 continues moving with a nearly constant velocity and is far ahead, posing negligible risk.

Given the provided data, more precise calculations of TTC and MDC are difficult. However, a qualitative assessment is possible. The most important obstacle to monitor is 20148, as it is relatively close to the ego vehicle. While it is decelerating, its continued proximity warrants attention.
