To analyze the given scenario, let's consider the most recent timestep at 0.5 seconds, evaluating the risk level for each obstacle regarding their trajectory and potential collisions:

1. **Ego Vehicle (20151.0)**
   - Position: (27.0365, 97.7897)
   - Velocity: 7.5176 m/s 
   - The vehicle is decelerating with an acceleration of -6.2236 m/sÂ².

2. **Obstacle 20135.0**
   - Position: (18.0261, 73.5177)
   - Velocity: 0.0 m/s
   - Obstacle is stationary and behind the ego vehicle in the same lanelet. There's no immediate risk from this obstacle as its relative position is far behind the ego vehicle.

3. **Obstacle 20137.0**
   - Position: (20.1701, 79.2932)
   - Velocity: 0.0 m/s
   - Obstacle is also stationary and further from the ego's trajectory. The lateral and longitudinal distances ensure no immediate risk.

4. **Obstacle 20141.0**
   - Position: (22.5488, 85.7009)
   - Velocity: 1.7795 m/s
   - This obstacle is moving but slower relative to the ego. It is behind the ego and moving further back from the ego's trajectory over time, indicating no immediate risk.

5. **Obstacle 20148.0**
   - Position: (25.0769, 92.5114)
   - Velocity: 8.4739 m/s
   - This is moving parallel to the ego in the same lanelet, but its speed and position suggest it does not pose an immediate collision threat as it maintains a reasonable distance.

6. **Obstacle 20155.0**
   - Position: (34.5662, 118.0739)
   - Velocity: 12.5511 m/s
   - Obstacle is ahead of the ego vehicle. It is moving faster than the ego but maintains a safe distance. No immediate collision risk.

### Conclusion:

From the analysis, no immediate collision threat or extreme risk obstacles exist. The ego vehicle maintains safe distances with decelerating, and obstacles' trajectories are diverging from the path of the ego vehicle.

Here's the structured JSON output, focusing on zero high-threat observations:
