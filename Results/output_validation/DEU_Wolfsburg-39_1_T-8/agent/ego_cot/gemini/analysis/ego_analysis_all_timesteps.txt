### Safety analysis for timestep 0.5 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

**Assumptions and Clarifications:**

* Since "adjusted distances" are explicitly requested but not provided in the context, the provided real distances (DTClong, DTClat) will be used directly.  The lack of adjusted distances and vehicle dimensions introduces uncertainty in the proximity assessment.  A real-world system should *always* account for vehicle size.
* Lateral movement is assumed negligible for all obstacles due to the consistent 0 m/s lateral velocity.  The analysis will therefore focus on longitudinal TTC and MDC.
*  "Exact lateral alignment or unknown case" statements suggest uncertainty in lateral positioning.  This further underscores the need for adjusted distances and vehicle dimensions for a truly robust analysis.
* TTC is calculated as DTClong / Vrel_long. We only look at cases where Vrel_long is negative (obstacle moving towards the ego vehicle).


### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 20135**
    - Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is far ahead (21.38m)
    - Distance safety score: 5
    - Time Risk reason: Large TTC
    - Time safety score: 5
    - Overall Risk score: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 20137**
    - Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is far ahead (15.22m)
    - Distance safety score: 5
    - Time Risk reason: Large TTC
    - Time safety score: 5
    - Overall Risk score: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 20141**
    - Distance Risk reason: Obstacle at 8.39m.
    - Distance safety score: 4
    - Time Risk reason: Relatively large TTC
    - Time safety score: 4
    - Overall Risk score: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 20148**
    - Distance Risk reason: Obstacle very close at 1.12m.
    - Distance safety score: 2  (High Risk)
    - Time Risk reason: Although the obstacle is moving away longitudinally (Vrel_long > 0), its proximity and the recent trend of decreasing distance necessitates a high-risk assessment. Considering the provided data, we can estimate the time it took for the obstacle to get to its current position using previous time step. (2.83 - 1.12)/0.96 is approximately 1.78 seconds. So, in the next step, the relative velocity would become negative as the vehicle starts moving towards ego vehicle.
    - Time safety score: 2 (High Risk)
    - Overall Risk score: 2

- **Obstacle ID: 20155**
    - Distance Risk reason: Obstacle far behind (-17.13m). Poses no immediate threat.
    - Distance safety score: 5
    - Time Risk reason: Not applicable as it's moving away from the ego vehicle.
    - Time safety score: 5
    - Overall Risk score: 5
