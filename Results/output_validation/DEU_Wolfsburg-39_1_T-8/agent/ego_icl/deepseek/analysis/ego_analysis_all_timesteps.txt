Let me analyze each obstacle at the most recent timestep (0.5 seconds) with trajectory context from previous timesteps:

1. Obstacle 20135 (Front):
   - Adjusted distance: 21.38m longitudinal, 0.00m lateral
   - Relative velocity: -7.52 m/s (approaching)
   - TTC: 21.38/7.52 = 2.84s (Medium Risk)
   - MDC: 21.38m (No Risk)
   - Risk: Medium (3) - Stable approach but sufficient distance

2. Obstacle 20137 (Front):
   - Adjusted distance: 15.22m longitudinal, 0.00m lateral
   - Relative velocity: -7.52 m/s (approaching)
   - TTC: 15.22/7.52 = 2.02s (Medium Risk)
   - MDC: 15.22m (No Risk)
   - Risk: Medium (3) - Similar to 20135 but closer

3. Obstacle 20141 (Front):
   - Adjusted distance: 8.39m longitudinal, 0.00m lateral
   - Relative velocity: -5.74 m/s (approaching)
   - TTC: 8.39/5.74 = 1.46s (Medium Risk)
   - MDC: 8.39m (No Risk)
   - Risk: Medium (3) - Closer than others but still manageable

4. Obstacle 20148 (Front):
   - Adjusted distance: 1.12m longitudinal, 0.00m lateral
   - Relative velocity: +0.96 m/s (moving away)
   - TTC: N/A (diverging)
   - MDC: 1.12m (High Risk)
   - Critical observation: Distance was 4.90m at 0.1s â†’ 1.12m at 0.5s but now moving away
   - Risk: High (2) - Very close proximity but diverging

5. Obstacle 20155 (Behind):
   - Adjusted distance: -17.13m longitudinal, 0.00m lateral
   - Relative velocity: +5.03 m/s (approaching from behind)
   - TTC: 17.13/5.03 = 3.41s (Low Risk)
   - MDC: 17.13m (No Risk)
   - Risk: Low (4) - Approaching but large distance

Trajectory Analysis:
- Obstacle 20148 is most critical - was at 4.90m at 0.1s and reached 1.12m by 0.5s
- Now shows positive velocity (moving away) but MDC remains small
- Other front obstacles show consistent approach patterns
- Rear obstacle not immediately concerning

Final Risk Assessment:
- No active collision (risk 0)
- Obstacle 20148 is Extreme Risk (1) due to very small MDC despite diverging
- No predicted collision obstacle since 20148 is now moving away
