### Obstacle Analysis:

**Obstacle 20135:**
- **Position & Motion:** In front of ego vehicle, relative velocity of -7.52 m/s (approaching).
- **Adjusted Distances:** Longitudinal: approximately 21.38 m, Lateral: 0.00 m.
- **TTC Calculation:** TTC_long = 21.38 m / 7.52 m/s ≈ 2.84 s.
- **MDC Calculation:** Given alignment and current velocity, if nothing changes, MDC ≈ 21.38 m.
  - *Risk Interpretation:* Medium Risk — TTC is between 1.0-3.0 s.

**Obstacle 20137:**
- **Position & Motion:** In front, approaching with relative velocity of -7.52 m/s.
- **Adjusted Distances:** Longitudinal: approximately 15.22 m, Lateral: 0.00 m.
- **TTC Calculation:** TTC_long = 15.22 m / 7.52 m/s ≈ 2.02 s.
- **MDC Calculation:** Given alignment and current velocity, MDC ≈ 15.22 m.
  - *Risk Interpretation:* Medium Risk — TTC is between 1.0-3.0 s.

**Obstacle 20141:**
- **Position & Motion:** In front, approaching with relative velocity of -5.74 m/s.
- **Adjusted Distances:** Longitudinal: approximately 8.39 m, Lateral: 0.00 m.
- **TTC Calculation:** TTC_long = 8.39 m / 5.74 m/s ≈ 1.46 s.
- **MDC Calculation:** Given alignment and current velocity, MDC ≈ 8.39 m.
  - *Risk Interpretation:* Medium Risk — TTC is between 1.0-3.0 s.

**Obstacle 20148:**
- **Position & Motion:** In front, moving away with relative velocity of 0.96 m/s.
- **Adjusted Distances:** Longitudinal: approximately 1.12 m, Lateral: 0.00 m.
- **TTC Calculation:** The obstacle is moving away; no immediate collision risk.
- **MDC Calculation:** Always increasing due to separating velocities.
  - *Risk Interpretation:* Low Risk — sufficient separation and expanding distances.

**Obstacle 20155:**
- **Position & Motion:** Behind the ego vehicle, approaching with velocity 5.03 m/s.
- **Adjusted Distances:** Approximate longitudinal distance -17.13 m (indicating behind).
- **TTC Calculation:** As the obstacle is behind and speeds indicate closing, it's manageable due to position.
- **MDC Calculation:** Considering position, the immediate proximity impact is minimized.
  - *Risk Interpretation:* Low Risk — no immediate chance of rear-end due to current speeds.

In this scenario, all obstacles were evaluated for collision risk at the most recent snapshot, with a focus on those in front of the ego vehicle, where immediate action could be needed if trajectories continue to converge. The analysis shows no immediate collision (risk score 0) but highlights potential medium risks that require attention.
