At t=0.7s, Ego continues decelerating and moving forward in lanelet 2039.  Several obstacles are present in the same lanelet. Let's analyze the closest ones:

* **Obstacle 20148:** Located at (25.0123, 92.3374), moving at 7.7863 with deceleration. Given Ego's position (26.5038, 96.3547) and its deceleration, a collision is unlikely in the immediate next timestep, but the trajectories suggest increasing risk in the near future (next few timesteps). I classify this as medium risk (3) for the current timestep.

* **Obstacle 20155:** Located at (33.9799, 116.4945), moving with a speed of 12.5477 and minimal deceleration. The x-coordinate difference suggests this obstacle is significantly ahead of the ego vehicle.  Combined with Ego's ongoing deceleration, the risk is low (4).


Other obstacles are far enough away that they present negligible risk (5) in this timestep.
