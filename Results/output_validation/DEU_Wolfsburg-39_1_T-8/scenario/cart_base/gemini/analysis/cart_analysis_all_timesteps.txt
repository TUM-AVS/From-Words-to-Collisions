At t=0.7s, the ego vehicle is at (26.50, 96.35) and decelerating.  All obstacles and ego are in the same lanelet (2039). Focusing on the most recent timestep (0.7s):

* **Obstacle 20148**: Located at (25.01, 92.34).  This obstacle is relatively close to the ego vehicle in both x and y coordinates and moving considerably slower, posing a high risk of collision if the ego vehicle continues to decelerate while 20148 is also decelerating but considerably slower. Although the ego vehicle is slightly ahead, the closing distance and speed differential suggests an extreme risk.

* **Obstacle 20155**:  Located at (33.98, 116.49). Although this obstacle has a higher velocity than the ego vehicle, it's considerably further down the lane.  Given the current trajectories and assuming they remain in the same lane, the risk is currently low.

* **Obstacles 20128, 20135, 20137, 20141**: These obstacles are significantly further behind the ego vehicle and pose no immediate risk.
