### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 20128.0
- Distance Risk reason: The obstacle is far behind the ego vehicle and poses no immediate threat.  Its static position over time confirms it is not a risk.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason:  The obstacle is stationary and poses no risk based on its historical and current velocity and acceleration.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5
- Obstacle ID: 20135.0
- Distance Risk reason: The obstacle is far behind the ego vehicle. It has remained stationary throughout the observed period.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: The obstacle is stationary, exhibiting no change in velocity or acceleration over time.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5
- Obstacle ID: 20137.0
- Distance Risk reason:  While closer than 20128 and 20135, this obstacle is still significantly behind the ego vehicle and poses no immediate threat given its static position and the ego vehicle's current velocity.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: The obstacle's stationary nature and zero velocity/acceleration over time indicate no risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5
- Obstacle ID: 20141.0
- Distance Risk reason: This obstacle is relatively close to the ego vehicle and behind it. However, it is moving slowly and the ego vehicle is moving away from it.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason:  The obstacle's slow speed and the ego vehicle's higher speed moving in the same direction mitigate the time-based risk.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4
- Obstacle ID: 20148.0
- Distance Risk reason: This obstacle is closer to the ego vehicle and poses a higher risk than the previous obstacles. Although it is moving in the same general direction, the ego vehicle is decelerating faster than the obstacle vehicle.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: While the ego vehicle is still moving faster, the closing speeds suggest a medium risk requiring monitoring.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3
- Obstacle ID: 20155.0
- Distance Risk reason: This obstacle is far ahead of the ego vehicle and poses no immediate risk due to the large distance.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason:  The obstacle is moving at a similar speed to the ego vehicle and slightly faster,  but the large distance separating them mitigates the risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5


### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. **Most critical obstacles:** Obstacle 20148.0 presents the highest risk due to its proximity and closing speed relative to the ego vehicle. While Obstacle 20141.0 is also relatively close, its slow speed and the ego vehicle's movement away reduce the risk.
2. **Trajectory analysis:** Over the observed period, the ego vehicle is decelerating while moving forward in lane 2039. Obstacle 20148.0 is also decelerating but at a slower rate and closer to the ego vehicle path.  Other obstacles are either stationary or far enough away to be of less concern.
3. **Relative positions, velocities, and accelerations:** The ego vehicle's deceleration, combined with the position and velocity of 20148.0, creates a situation requiring careful monitoring. While not an immediate collision, the trend suggests a potential risk increase if these patterns continue.
4. **Collision determination:** No collision has occurred or is immediately imminent within the analyzed timeframe.
5. **Reasoning:** The analysis focuses on the relative motion between the ego vehicle and the obstacles.  While the ego vehicle's deceleration contributes to the risk related to Obstacle 20148.0, the current data doesn't indicate an unavoidable collision within the observed timeframe. Continued monitoring is essential.

{
  "CollisionObstacles": [],
  "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null,
  "ScenarioAnalysis": {
    "IsCollisionScenario": false,
    "Reasoning": "No collision is detected or predicted within the provided timeframe.  Obstacle 20148.0 presents the highest risk due to its proximity and closing speed relative to the decelerating ego vehicle, requiring further observation. Other obstacles pose no immediate threat due to their distance, static nature, or opposing direction of motion relative to the ego vehicle."
