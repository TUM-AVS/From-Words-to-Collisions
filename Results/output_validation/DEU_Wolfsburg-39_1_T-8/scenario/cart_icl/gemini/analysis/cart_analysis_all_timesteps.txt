### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 20128.0
- Distance Risk reason: Far from ego and stationary.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Stationary and poses no immediate threat.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 20135.0
- Distance Risk reason: Far from ego and stationary.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Stationary and poses no immediate threat.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 20137.0
- Distance Risk reason: Far from ego and stationary.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Stationary and poses no immediate threat.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 20141.0
- Distance Risk reason: Far from ego and slow-moving.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Slow-moving and poses no immediate threat.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 20148.0
- Distance Risk reason: Moderately far from ego but moving slower than ego. Ego's deceleration indicates potential for catching up but still safe.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Although moving, the distance and relative speeds suggest sufficient time to react.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- Obstacle ID: 20155.0
- Distance Risk reason: Further ahead of the ego vehicle and moving with similar velocity.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Similar velocity to the ego vehicle and poses no immediate threat due to its position ahead.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5


### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
The ego vehicle is decelerating while moving in the same lanelet as several other obstacles. Most obstacles are stationary or slow-moving and far enough from the ego vehicle, presenting no immediate risk. Obstacle 20148 is moderately far and moving slower than the ego but ego is decelerating significantly.  While this requires monitoring, it does not currently represent a collision scenario. Obstacle 20155 is further ahead and moving at a similar speed, posing no collision risk. Overall, this is not a collision scenario.

{
  "CollisionObstacles": null,
  "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null,
  "ScenarioAnalysis": {
    "IsCollisionScenario": false,
    "Reasoning": "No obstacle poses an immediate collision risk. The ego vehicle is decelerating, but all obstacles are either stationary, slow-moving, or sufficiently far away to avoid collision."
