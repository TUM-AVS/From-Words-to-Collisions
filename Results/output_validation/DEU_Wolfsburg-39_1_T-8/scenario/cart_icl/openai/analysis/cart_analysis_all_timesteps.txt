### Obstacle Analysis for the Most Recent Timestep:

**Obstacle: 20128.0**
- **Distance Risk reason**: This obstacle is new, previously undetected. The initial position is far from the Ego vehicle, so minimal immediate risk.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: Not moving, thus no immediate risk. No relative velocity towards Ego.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

**Obstacle: 20135.0**
- **Distance Risk reason**: Stationary for the entire timeline and remains at a significantly lower Y-coordinate.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: Not moving, no change in risk over time.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

**Obstacle: 20137.0**
- **Distance Risk reason**: Stationary and far from the Ego path throughout the observations.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: Zero velocity indicates no immediate collision risk.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

**Obstacle: 20141.0**
- **Distance Risk reason**: Gradually moving but with more lateral distance away from the Ego's path.
- **Distance safety score**: 4
- **Time Risk reason**: Low velocity and decreasing acceleration, indicating reduced collision probability over time.
- **Time safety score**: 4
- **Overall Risk score**: 4

**Obstacle: 20148.0**
- **Distance Risk reason**: Higher speed but directed away from the Ego, more lateral.
- **Distance safety score**: 4
- **Time Risk reason**: Speed and acceleration suggest movement away from Ego's path.
- **Time safety score**: 4
- **Overall Risk score**: 4

**Obstacle: 20155.0**
- **Distance Risk reason**: Consistently moving quickly away from Ego.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: High velocity maintaining a significant distance.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
- **Scenario Evaluation**: No obstacles are on a direct collision path with the Ego vehicle. All obstacles either stationary or moving away/in a lateral direction, reducing any potential collision risk. The Ego's deceleration reduces forward collision risk.
