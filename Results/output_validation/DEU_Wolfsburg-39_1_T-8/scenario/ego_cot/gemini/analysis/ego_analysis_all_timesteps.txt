### Safety analysis for timestep 0.7 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

**A crucial piece of information is missing: the adjusted distances (adjusted_d_long and adjusted_d_lat).**  The prompt explicitly states that these adjusted values *must* be used for the calculations.  Since they aren't provided, I will make assumptions about vehicle size and motion to illustrate the process, but these results will *not* be accurate without the correct input data.  I will assume a vehicle size of 4 meters long by 2 meters wide in this example.

### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 20128**
    - Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is in front, 25.01m longitudinal and lateral distance.  Subtracting approximate vehicle size, adjusted distance is still large, representing low risk.
    - Distance safety score: 4
    - Time Risk reason:  Approaching at -6.03 m/s longitudinally, TTClong is approximately 4 seconds (25.01m / 6.03 m/s).  Lateral motion is unknown, but given the large lateral separation and apparent lack of lateral movement for now, TTClat should be high.
    - Time safety score: 4
    - Overall Risk score: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 20135**
    - Distance Risk reason: Similar to 20128, front and far, implying low risk.
    - Distance safety score: 4
    - Time Risk reason: Approaching, but adequate distance and time.
    - Time safety score: 4
    - Overall Risk score: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 20137**
    - Distance Risk reason: In front, but closer than 20128 and 20135. Reduced lateral distance.
    - Distance safety score: 3
    - Time Risk reason: Approaching faster; TTClong is approximately 2 seconds. Still some buffer, but warrants monitoring.
    - Time safety score: 3
    - Overall Risk score: 3

- **Obstacle ID: 20141**
    - Distance Risk reason: In front and relatively close. Less than 10m adjusted_d_long estimated after vehicle size adjustment.
    - Distance safety score: 2
    - Time Risk reason: Closing quickly. TTClong around 1.5 seconds estimated based on provided velocities.
    - Time safety score: 2
    - Overall Risk score: 2

- **Obstacle ID: 20148**
    - Distance Risk reason: Reported as a collision (0.0m distance).  This confirms a collision.
    - Distance safety score: 0
    - Time Risk reason:  TTC is irrelevant as a collision is already reported.
    - Time safety score: 0
    - Overall Risk score: 0

- **Obstacle ID: 20155**
    - Distance Risk reason: Behind and far, presenting minimal risk.
    - Distance safety score: 5
    - Time Risk reason: Although it's approaching from behind, the distance and relative velocity suggest ample time.
    - Time safety score: 4 
    - Overall Risk score: 4

**Important Note:**  The provided calculations and risk scores are estimates based on assumptions about vehicle dimensions and simplified calculations.  The lack of adjusted distance data makes accurate assessment impossible.  Provide the adjusted distances for a proper and reliable collision analysis.
