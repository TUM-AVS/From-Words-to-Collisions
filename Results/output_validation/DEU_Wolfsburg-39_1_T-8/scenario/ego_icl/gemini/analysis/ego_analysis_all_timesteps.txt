* **Obstacle 20128:** This obstacle appears at 0.7 seconds in front of the ego vehicle at a longitudinal distance of 25.01m and lateral distance of 0.00m. Given the substantial distance and the fact that this is the first appearance of this obstacle, there's not enough information to determine a definitive risk. The lateral alignment suggests it's in the same lane, but the longitudinal distance is large. Preliminary assessment: Low Risk (4).

* **Obstacle 20135:**  This obstacle is consistently in front and longitudinally aligned with the ego vehicle. Over multiple timesteps, its longitudinal distance decreases from 24.46m to 19.85m.  TTC = 19.85m / 6.03 m/s ≈ 3.3s. MDC is difficult to assess precisely without lateral movement information, but with perfect lateral alignment and decreasing longitudinal distance, we can assume MDC will be primarily determined by the longitudinal distance in the near future. Given the distance and TTC, we classify this as Medium Risk (3).

* **Obstacle 20137:** Similar to 20135, this obstacle remains in front and longitudinally aligned, decreasing from 18.30m to 13.69m.  TTC = 13.69m / 6.03 m/s ≈ 2.3s. Again, MDC will be determined by longitudinal trajectory.  This obstacle is also considered a Medium Risk (3).

* **Obstacle 20141:** Consistently in front and longitudinally aligned, this obstacle's distance decreases from 11.46m to 6.86m. TTC = 6.86m / 4.57m/s ≈ 1.5s.  This falls within the Medium Risk category (3), though closer to High Risk than the previous obstacles.

* **Obstacle 20148:**  This obstacle presents the most significant risk.  Its longitudinal distance has been steadily decreasing across timesteps (4.90m, 3.81m, 2.83m, 1.93m, 1.12m, 0.41m) and reaches 0.00m at 0.7 seconds. Despite the relative velocity briefly turning positive (away from ego) at timestep 0.4, the consistent approach across previous steps and the perfect lateral alignment at the latest timestep signify a collision has occurred. Risk: Collision (0).

* **Obstacle 20155:** This obstacle is consistently behind the ego vehicle and perfectly laterally aligned. While its longitudinal distance (negative due to being behind) is increasing (from -16.82m to -16.97m), indicating it's getting further away in the last few steps. With increasing distance, No Risk(5).



**Collision Scenario Determination:**

Yes, this is a collision scenario. Obstacle 20148 has collided with the ego vehicle at timestamp 0.7s.
