To analyze the given scenario, we will focus on the most recent timestep (0.7 seconds) and consider previous data to understand trajectory changes. We'll use adjusted distances and examine relative motion to assess risk accurately.

### Obstacle-by-Obstacle Analysis:

#### Obstacle 20128
- **Position**: Front of the ego car
- **Adjusted Distance**: Longitudinal likely similar > current raw distance 25.01 m (adjustments not provided)
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal -6.03 m/s
- **Relative Acceleration**: Longitudinal -1.46 m/s²
- **Motion Description**: Driving toward the ego car
- **Analysis**: Moving toward ego but at a relatively safe distance with moderate closing speed.
- **TTC Calculation**: Assuming small adjustment, TTC ≈ 25 / 6.03 = 4.15 seconds
- **MDC Consideration**: Long distance implies assured low risk.
- **Risk Assessment**: Low Risk (4)

#### Obstacle 20135
- **Position**: Front of the ego car
- **Adjusted Distance**: Longitudinal likely similar > current raw distance 19.85 m
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal -6.03 m/s
- **Relative Acceleration**: Longitudinal -1.46 m/s²
- **Motion Description**: Driving toward the ego car
- **TTC Calculation**: Assuming small adjustment, TTC ≈ 19 / 6.03 = 3.15 seconds
- **MDC Consideration**: Safe margin distance, decreasing steadily.
- **Risk Assessment**: Medium Risk (3)

#### Obstacle 20137
- **Position**: Front of the ego car
- **Adjusted Distance**: Longitudinal likely similar > current raw distance 13.69 m
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal -6.03 m/s
- **Relative Acceleration**: Longitudinal -1.46 m/s²
- **Motion Description**: Driving toward the ego car
- **TTC Calculation**: Assuming small adjustment, TTC ≈ 13.69 / 6.03 = 2.27 seconds
- **MDC Consideration**: Closing in, continued approach could become severe risk.
- **Risk Assessment**: Medium Risk (3)

#### Obstacle 20141
- **Position**: Front of the ego car
- **Adjusted Distance**: Longitudinal likely similar > current raw distance 6.86 m
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal -4.57 m/s
- **Relative Acceleration**: Longitudinal -0.99 m/s²
- **Motion Description**: Driving toward the ego car
- **TTC Calculation**: TTC = 6.86 / 4.57 = 1.50 seconds
- **MDC Consideration**: Continual rapid closing, increasing risk.
- **Risk Assessment**: High Risk (2)

#### Obstacle 20148
- **Position**: Front of the ego car
- **Adjusted Distance**: Longitudinal 0.00 m; Collision recorded in context.
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal 1.76 m/s (away)
- **Relative Acceleration**: Longitudinal -0.27 m/s²
- **Motion Description**: Exact alignment in collision
- **Immediate Analysis**: Collision has occurred due to identical position.
- **Risk Assessment**: Collision (0)

#### Obstacle 20155
- **Position**: Behind the ego car
- **Adjusted Distance**: Longitudinal likely similar > current raw distance -16.97 m
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal 6.52 m/s (approaching)
- **Relative Acceleration**: Longitudinal -1.46 m/s²
- **Motion Description**: Driving toward the ego car from behind
- **Analysis**: Approaching but at considerable trailing distance.
- **TTC Calculation**: N/A since relative position behind.
- **MDC Consideration**: Safe following distance, irrelevant due to rearwards approach.
- **Risk Assessment**: Low Risk (4)

### Collision Scenario Determination
Based on the analysis, Obstacle 20148 is currently in collision with the ego vehicle. This obstacle has a risk score of 0, confirming an active collision scenario.
