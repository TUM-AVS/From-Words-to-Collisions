Here's the collision risk analysis:

**Ego Vehicle (ID: 30743):** The ego vehicle is moving with a velocity between 2.12 m/s and 2.55 m/s and accelerating. It starts in lanelet 350 and transitions into lanelet 3002.

**Obstacle 30717:**  Stationary. Poses no immediate risk, but should be monitored. Risk score: 5.

**Obstacle 30718:**  Almost stationary. Poses no immediate risk. Risk score: 5.

**Obstacle 30727:** Moving with a relatively high velocity (increasing from 7.02 m/s to 8.88 m/s) and positive acceleration. Transitions from lanelet 3273 to 3271.  Initially poses a medium risk due to its speed and proximity, but the trajectories diverge over time as it moves into a different lanelet, reducing risk. Risk score: 3.

**Obstacle 30735:** Moderate velocity (increasing from 4.22 m/s to 5.72 m/s) and positive acceleration. Moves from lanelet 3007 to 3274, suggesting a lane change maneuver. Initially poses a medium risk due to proximity, and the risk remains medium due to continued nearby trajectory. Risk score: 3.

**Obstacle 30736:** Moderate velocity (increasing from 4.82 m/s to 6.49 m/s) and positive acceleration, remaining in lanelet 3006.  Risk score: 4.

**Obstacle 30738:** High velocity (increasing from 6.97 m/s to 8.54 m/s) and acceleration, moving from lanelet 3272 and into lanelet 3270. Risk score: 3

**Obstacle 30739:** Moderate velocity (increasing from 5.53 m/s to 7.14 m/s) and positive acceleration, staying in lanelet 3003.  Risk score: 4.

**Obstacle 30740:** Low velocity (increasing from 3.06 m/s to 4.51 m/s) and positive acceleration, moving from lanelet 3001 into lanelet 353.  Risk score: 4.

**Obstacle 30741:** Low velocity (increasing from 3.26 m/s to 5.03 m/s) and acceleration, moving from lanelet 3000 to 352. Initial proximity elevates risk to medium; however, future time steps indicate a less risky trajectory. Risk score: 3

**Obstacle 30744:** Moderate velocity (increasing from 4.18 m/s to 5.79 m/s) and positive acceleration, staying in lanelet 2999. Initial proximity creates a medium risk, and the risk remains medium in future steps. Risk score: 3.

**Obstacle 30746:** Low velocity (increasing from 1.96 m/s to 3.31 m/s) and positive acceleration, staying in lanelet 3001. Risk score: 4.

**Obstacle 30747:** Moderate velocity (increasing from 2.99 m/s to 4.48 m/s), staying in lanelet 2999. The combination of proximity and velocity elevates the risk to medium, and future steps suggest a continuing medium level of risk. Risk score: 3.

**Obstacle 30749:** Moderate velocity (increasing from 4.36 m/s to 5.55 m/s) and positive acceleration, staying in lanelet 2998.  Risk score: 4.

**Obstacle 30750:** Stationary. Risk score: 5

**Obstacle 30751:** Low velocity (increasing from 1.23 m/s to 2.29 m/s) and acceleration, staying in lanelet 348.  Risk score: 5.


**Obstacle 30752:** Stationary. Risk score: 5.

**Obstacle 30753:** Low velocity (increasing from 2.23 m/s to 3.63 m/s) and acceleration, transitioning from lanelet 3000 into lanelet 352. Risk score: 4.

**Obstacle 30754:** Low velocity (increasing from 1.69 m/s to 2.70 m/s) and acceleration, moving from lanelet 347 to lanelet 3000. Risk score: 4.

**Obstacle 30757:** Low velocity (increasing from 2.35 m/s to 3.52 m/s) and acceleration, staying in lanelet 346. Risk score: 5.

**Obstacle 30758:** Moderate velocity (increasing from 3.58 m/s to 4.65 m/s) and acceleration, staying in lanelet 2998. Risk score: 4.

**Obstacle 30759:** Initially moderate velocity (2.53 m/s) but decelerating (down to 1.26 m/s), staying in lanelet 686. Poses no risk because of the significant lateral distance from the ego vehicle. Risk score: 5.

**Obstacle 30760:** Moderate velocity (increasing from 3.26 m/s to 3.97 m/s), and positive acceleration, staying in lanelet 345. Poses low risk to ego vehicle. Risk score: 5.
