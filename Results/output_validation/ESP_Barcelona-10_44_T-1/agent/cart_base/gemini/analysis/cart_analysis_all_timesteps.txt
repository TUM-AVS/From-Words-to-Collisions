Obstacle 30717:  Stationary and far from the ego vehicle throughout the scenario. Negligible risk.
Obstacle 30718:  Appears at t=9.5s, stationary and far from the ego vehicle. Negligible risk.
Obstacle 30727: Moves with a relatively high velocity and acceleration but its trajectory remains far from the ego vehicle. Low risk.
Obstacle 30735: Initially somewhat close to the ego vehicle, but its trajectory diverges and it poses no significant risk. Medium risk.
Obstacle 30736:  Similar to 30735, somewhat close initially but diverges and doesn't pose a significant risk. Medium risk.
Obstacle 30738: Similar trajectory to 30727; fast-moving but doesn't approach the ego vehicle closely. Low risk.
Obstacle 30739:  Relatively close to the ego vehicle, but maintains a safe distance and its trajectory does not converge significantly with the ego vehicle's trajectory over the scenario duration. Medium risk.
Obstacle 30740: Close proximity to the ego vehicle, but the trajectories appear to diverge slightly over the scenario duration. Medium Risk.
Obstacle 30741:  Close proximity to the ego vehicle, but the trajectories appear to diverge slightly over the scenario duration. Medium Risk.
Obstacle 30744: Initially close and moving towards the ego vehicle, but the y-positions show enough separation to avoid a collision given the short timeframe and diverging trajectory due to the ego vehicle's turn. Medium Risk.
Obstacle 30746: Some risk due to proximity, but the trajectories show divergence. Low Risk.
Obstacle 30747: Similar to 30744, but its trajectory is slightly further away from the ego vehicle's. Medium Risk.
Obstacle 30749:  Moves somewhat close to the ego vehicle, but the trajectories diverge. Medium Risk.
Obstacle 30750: Stationary and far from the ego vehicle. Negligible risk.
Obstacle 30751: Some initial proximity but the trajectories diverge. Low Risk.
Obstacle 30752: Stationary and far from the ego vehicle. Negligible risk.
Obstacle 30753:  Relatively close, but its trajectory appears to diverge from the ego vehicle's path. Low Risk.
Obstacle 30754: Some initial proximity but the trajectories diverge. Low Risk.
Obstacle 30757:  Its trajectory remains further from the ego vehicle compared to 30754. Low Risk.
Obstacle 30758:  Moves somewhat close to the ego vehicle, but the trajectories diverge. Medium Risk.
Obstacle 30759: Moves in the opposite lane and does not pose a risk. Negligible risk.
Obstacle 30760: Its trajectory remains further from the ego vehicle compared to 30757. Low Risk.
