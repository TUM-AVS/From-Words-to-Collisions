Obstacle 30738 shows a concerning trend of increasing velocity and acceleration towards the ego vehicle's lanelet. While not immediately colliding in this timestep, the rapid approach warrants close monitoring and a high-risk assessment. Obstacle 30739, also exhibiting increasing velocity, is moving towards the ego vehicle's predicted path with a moderately high risk of collision if both maintain their current trajectories.
