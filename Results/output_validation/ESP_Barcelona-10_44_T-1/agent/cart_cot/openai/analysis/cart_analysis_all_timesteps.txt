### Brief Analysis:

In this scenario, we analyze the positions and velocities of the obstacles compared to the ego vehicle at the most recent time step (10.0 seconds).

1. **Obstacle 30727.0:** This obstacle is approaching the lane boundary very closely. With a high velocity of 8.8843, it is on a trajectory that might intersect with the ego's lane soon. Due to the high speed and the lack of immediate control, this obstacle poses an extreme risk requiring immediate attention.

2. **Obstacle 30739.0:** This obstacle is moving with a velocity of 7.1429 and its trajectory suggests it may intersect with the ego vehicle's path shortly. The orientation and speed indicate a high likelihood of collision if no evasive action is taken. Therefore, this has been identified as the highest risk.

### JSON Output:

```json
{
    "CollisionObstacles": [],
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "30727.0",
        "OverallRiskScore": 1
    },
    "HighRiskObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "30739.0",
        "OverallRiskScore": 2
    }
}
```

This evaluation focuses on potential intersection paths that could lead to collisions if proactive measures are not taken by the autonomous system.
