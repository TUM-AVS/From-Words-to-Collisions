### Analysis of Risky Obstacles:

1. **Obstacle 30741 (ID: 30741)**:
   - **Position**: (200.9334, 88.0528) at 10.0s, moving towards the ego vehicle.
   - **Velocity**: 5.0278 m/s, accelerating at 1.9625 m/s².
   - **Relative Motion**: The obstacle is in lanelet 352, which is adjacent to the ego's lanelet (3002). The lateral distance is minimal (~4.7m), and the obstacle is moving towards the ego's path.
   - **TTC**: Estimated TTC is low due to high relative velocity and proximity.
   - **Risk**: **Extreme Risk (1)** - Collision is likely and imminent if no evasive action is taken.

2. **Obstacle 30739 (ID: 30739)**:
   - **Position**: (207.374, 85.2676) at 10.0s, moving towards the ego vehicle.
   - **Velocity**: 7.1429 m/s, accelerating at 1.5818 m/s².
   - **Relative Motion**: The obstacle is in lanelet 3003, which is adjacent to the ego's lanelet (3002). The lateral distance is ~8.5m, but the high velocity and acceleration pose a significant risk.
   - **TTC**: Estimated TTC is moderate but decreasing rapidly.
   - **Risk**: **High Risk (2)** - Close to collision, needs urgent action.

3. **Obstacle 30744 (ID: 30744)**:
   - **Position**: (199.7631, 94.307) at 10.0s, moving towards the ego vehicle.
   - **Velocity**: 5.7851 m/s, accelerating at 1.9798 m/s².
   - **Relative Motion**: The obstacle is in lanelet 2999, which is adjacent to the ego's lanelet (3002). The lateral distance is minimal (~1.5m), and the obstacle is moving towards the ego's path.
   - **TTC**: Estimated TTC is very low due to high relative velocity and proximity.
   - **Risk**: **Extreme Risk (1)** - Collision is likely and imminent if no evasive action is taken.

4. **Obstacle 30753 (ID: 30753)**:
   - **Position**: (193.6182, 95.5582) at 10.0s, moving towards the ego vehicle.
