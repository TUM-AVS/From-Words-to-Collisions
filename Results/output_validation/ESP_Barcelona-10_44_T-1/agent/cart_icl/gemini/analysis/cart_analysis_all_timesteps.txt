Obstacle 30738 is showing concerning behavior. It's accelerating and closing in on the ego vehicle's lanelet and predicted path. Its continuous acceleration coupled with decreasing Y values increases the risk of collision.  The distance between the vehicles and the closing rate suggest a medium risk. 

Obstacle 30753 is in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle and is approaching rapidly from behind. Its acceleration and speed differential raise concerns.  This suggests a medium risk.
