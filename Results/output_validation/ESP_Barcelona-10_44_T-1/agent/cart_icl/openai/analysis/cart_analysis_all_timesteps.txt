To evaluate the potential risk from each obstacle based on their proximity and trajectories relative to the ego vehicle, I considered their motion trends over the time steps provided, focusing on verifying their likelihood of collision or high-risk situations. Here is the analysis:

**From the most recent timestep (10.0 seconds):**

1. **Obstacle 30717**:
   - It is stationary and located at a relatively fixed distance. It remains in the same position (229.5792, 81.022) across all timesteps. Since it doesn't move, and assuming the ego has a constant path, its risk level is minimal unless a lane change occurs to its lane.

2. **Obstacle 30727**:
   - This moving obstacle (213.3969, 73.7926) features significant velocity (8.8843 m/s) and is on a possible collision course. Evaluating its relative position and velocity to the ego vehicle shows a consistent closing distance, causing this to be our highest risk of collision.
  
3. **Obstacle 30735**:
   - It is located at (199.3191, 76.8105) and its orientation and velocity change with some acceleration, indicating a trajectory that will intersect with the ego vehicleâ€™s path soon due to relative closeness in position. There is a high collision risk if no action is taken.
  
4. **Obstacle 30736**:
   - This obstacle (203.75, 77.507) has a steady approach toward the ego lane. The velocity and trajectory suggest it could potentially intersect with the ego if it stays on its path without adjustment.

**Risk Evaluation:**

- **Collision (0) Risk:** None based on the given final positions and consistent movements.
- **Extreme Risk (1):** Primarily from **Obstacle 30727** with significant velocity and constrained pathway having the highest probability to merge or cross paths with ego based on position data.
- **High Risk (2):** Potential from **Obstacle 30735** if the current trajectories do not divert.

**Other Borders:**
- Many obstacles, like the stationary ones or those with low relative velocities, exhibit low to negligible risk levels, ensuring that dynamic calculations primarily affect only few with potential high risks.

Given this simplified assessment, the main concerns revolve largely about relative velocity alignment and converging lane positions.
