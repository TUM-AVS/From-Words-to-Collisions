At t=10.0s, the following obstacles warrant attention:

**Obstacle 30735:** This obstacle is at longitudinal 0.27m and lateral -15.02m relative to the ego vehicle.  The longitudinal distance is extremely close to the ego vehicle. With a negative longitudinal velocity, this obstacle is approaching the ego vehicle indicating a possible collision. Considering the small longitudinal distance (0.27m), the `MDC` is less than 0.5 meters, and since the obstacle is approaching, the `TTC` is also very low, so an Overall risk score of 1 is assigned. This obstacle poses the greatest risk.

**Obstacle 30749:** Located at longitudinal -0.74m and lateral 0.00m relative to the ego, this obstacle is very close behind the ego vehicle and slightly offset laterally.  This proximity raises concern. The longitudinal distance is small (0.74m) placing this obstacle in a high-risk category. Given the negative longitudinal distance, the `MDC` qualifies as Extreme Risk. The `TTC` is also likely to be low, meriting an overall risk score of 1.

**Obstacle 30739:** This obstacle is slightly ahead of the ego vehicle at longitudinal 0.72m and lateral -3.35m. The small longitudinal distance warrants attention. This obstacle poses less risk than 30735, primarily due to its more substantial lateral offset. Therefore, an Overall risk score of 2 is assigned.

**Obstacle 30744:** Positioned at longitudinal -1.95m and lateral -1.60m, this obstacle is close behind the ego and to its right.  While the `MDC` exceeds 0.5m (not extreme risk), it remains under 1m. This, coupled with the obstacle's position behind the ego and its motion, makes a score of 2 more appropriate.

**Obstacle 30759:**  At longitudinal 3.25 m and lateral 14.76 m, this obstacle has a moderately low MDC and is moving towards the ego both longitudinally and laterally. The relatively close longitudinal distance makes quick reaction necessary, resulting in a score of 2.

Other obstacles are not considered high risk or above.
