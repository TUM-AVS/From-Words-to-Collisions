### Safety analysis for timestep 10.0s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

**Assumptions and Calculations:**

Since the provided scenario lacks ego vehicle dimensions and precise trajectory predictions, I'm making reasonable assumptions for the risk assessment.  I'm interpreting "real distance" as the center-to-center distance between the ego vehicle and the obstacle.  To get adjusted distances (and thus, MDC), I'm going to assume a vehicle size of 1.5 meters both longitudinally and laterally. This allows for a buffer.  I'm also calculating TTC using simple linear extrapolation based on current relative velocity; more sophisticated models would improve accuracy.

* **Adjusted Distance Longitudinal (adjusted_d_long):** |real distance longitudinal| - 1.5m (ego length/2 + obstacle length/2 approximation)
* **Adjusted Distance Lateral (adjusted_d_lat):** |real distance lateral| - 1.5m (ego width/2 + obstacle width/2 approximation)
* **TTC Longitudinal (TTClong):**  adjusted_d_long / relative velocity longitudinal
* **TTC Lateral (TTClat):** adjusted_d_lat / relative velocity lateral


**TTC and MDC Risk Level Mapping (as provided in prompt):**

| Metric Value | Risk Level | Score |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | Collision Risk | 0 |
| (0, 0.5] | Extreme Risk | 1 |
| (0.5, 1.0] | High Risk | 2 |
| (1.0, 3.0] | Medium Risk | 3 |
| (3.0, 5.0] | Low Risk | 4 |
| > 5.0 | No Risk | 5 |

### Obstacle Analysis:

**General Notes:** Obstacles moving away from the ego vehicle, even if close, are generally scored higher because the risk is inherently lower. Obstacles on the right that have a 0 m longitudinal distance have been adjusted in a way to reflect that there is collision risk present due to how close they are despite the values of the remaining metrics saying otherwise.
