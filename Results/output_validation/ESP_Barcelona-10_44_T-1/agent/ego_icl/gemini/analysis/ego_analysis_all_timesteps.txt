At t=10.0s:

* **Obstacle 30717**: Front-Left, longitudinal 20.19m, lateral 4.92m. Relative velocity: longitudinal -2.55 m/s, lateral -0.00 m/s.  This obstacle is moving away from the ego vehicle longitudinally and maintains lateral separation. Risk level: 5 (Negligible).

* **Obstacle 30718**: Front-Left, longitudinal 20.64m, lateral 12.42m. Relative velocity: longitudinal -2.55 m/s, lateral -0.02 m/s. This obstacle is also moving away longitudinally and has ample lateral separation. Risk level: 5 (Negligible).

* **Obstacle 30727**: Front-Right, longitudinal 12.83m, lateral -7.98m. Relative velocity: longitudinal 5.65 m/s, lateral -3.43 m/s. This obstacle is moving away from the ego vehicle both longitudinally and laterally. Risk level: 5 (Negligible).

* **Obstacle 30735**: Front-Right, longitudinal 0.27m, lateral -15.02m. Relative velocity: longitudinal -1.31 m/s, lateral -5.59 m/s. While very close longitudinally, the obstacle is moving away and also has significant lateral separation. Risk level: 3 (Medium) due to proximity.

* **Obstacle 30736**: Front-Right, longitudinal 3.13m, lateral -11.57m. Relative velocity: longitudinal 0.28 m/s, lateral -5.84 m/s. The obstacle is moving away laterally and almost stationary longitudinally. Risk level: 4 (Low).

* **Obstacle 30738**: Front-Right, longitudinal 15.07m, lateral -2.74m. Relative velocity: longitudinal 5.75 m/s, lateral -2.03 m/s. Moving away in both directions. Risk level: 5 (Negligible).

* **Obstacle 30739**: Front-Right, longitudinal 0.72m, lateral -3.35m. Relative velocity: longitudinal 4.31 m/s, lateral -2.00 m/s.  While laterally close and longitudinally very close, the obstacle's motion clearly indicates it is moving away, thus the risk is mitigated. Risk level: 3 (Medium) due to the proximity.

* **Obstacle 30740**: Right, longitudinal 0.00m, lateral -8.94m. Relative velocity: longitudinal 1.94 m/s, lateral -0.37 m/s. The obstacle is moving away laterally, despite longitudinal alignment. Risk level: 5 (Negligible).

* **Obstacle 30741**: Right, longitudinal 0.00m, lateral -5.52m. Relative velocity: longitudinal 2.46 m/s, lateral -0.42 m/s. Moving away laterally, longitudinal alignment doesn't pose a risk. Risk level: 5 (Negligible).

* **Obstacle 30744**: Rear-Right, longitudinal -1.95m, lateral -1.60m. Relative velocity: longitudinal 3.22 m/s, lateral -0.44 m/s.  The positive longitudinal velocity is concerning as the obstacle is approaching from behind, but it is moving further away laterally.  Risk level: 3 (Medium).

* **Obstacle 30746**: Rear-Right, longitudinal -8.23m, lateral -8.19m. Relative velocity: longitudinal 0.76 m/s, lateral -0.19 m/s. Despite being behind, longitudinal and lateral distances are substantial and motion is away. Risk level: 5 (Negligible).

* **Obstacle 30747**: Rear-Right, longitudinal -12.99m, lateral -0.90m. Relative velocity: longitudinal 1.93 m/s, lateral -0.25 m/s. While approaching from behind, lateral and longitudinal distances are safe enough. Risk level: 4 (Low).

* **Obstacle 30749**: Behind, longitudinal -0.74m, lateral 0.00m. Relative velocity: longitudinal 2.98 m/s, lateral -0.43 m/s. This obstacle is very close behind and poses a high risk due to the high closing velocity. Risk level: 2 (High).

* **Obstacle 30750**: Front-Left, similar to 30717 and 30718. Risk level: 5 (Negligible).

* **Obstacle 30751**: Rear-Right, similar to 30746. Risk level: 5 (Negligible).

* **Obstacle 30752**: Front-Left, similar to 30717 and 30718. Risk level: 5 (Negligible).

* **Obstacle 30753**: Rear-Right, similar to 30747, but slightly closer. Risk level: 4 (Low).

* **Obstacle 30754**: Rear-Right, moving further away. Risk level: 5 (Negligible).

* **Obstacle 30757**: Rear-right of the ego, with a longitudinal distance of -23.31m, lateral -0.40 m and longitudinal velocity of 0.97m/s. Risk level: 4 (Low)

* **Obstacle 30758**: Behind, longitudinal -12.06m, lateral 0.00m. Relative velocity: longitudinal 2.10 m/s. Risk level: 4 (Low)

* **Obstacle 30759**: Front-Left, longitudinal 3.25m, lateral 14.76m. Relative velocity: longitudinal -2.62 m/s, lateral -1.26 m/s.  Despite the close longitudinal distance, this obstacle is moving away longitudinally and has substantial lateral distance. Risk level: 4 (Low).

* **Obstacle 30760**: Behind, longitudinal -23.18 m, lateral 0.00 m. Relative velocity: longitudinal 1.42 m/s. Risk level: 4 (Low)
