To evaluate the collision risk, I will focus on the adjusted distances and the most recent timestep (10.0 seconds) while considering the projected trajectories of each obstacle over the previous time intervals.

### Obstacle Analysis and Trajectory Prediction:

#### Obstacle 30717 (Front-Left)
- **Adjusted Distance**: longitudinal 20.19m, lateral 4.92m
- **Relative Velocity**: longitudinal -2.55 m/s (approaching), lateral -0.00 m/s
- **Motion Description**: Driving toward the ego car longitudinally.
- **Performance:**
  - The obstacle is approaching in the longitudinal direction with no lateral movement. Over the observed timespan, it has consistently approached the ego vehicle. 
  - **TTC Calculation (Longitudinal)**: 20.19m / 2.55 m/s = approximately 7.92 seconds
  - **MDC**: > 5.0m
  - **Risk Score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)

#### Obstacle 30718 (Front-Left)
- **Adjusted Distance**: longitudinal 20.64m, lateral 12.42m
- **Relative Velocity**: longitudinal -2.55 m/s (approaching), lateral -0.02 m/s (almost steady)
- **Motion Description**: Driving toward the ego car longitudinally, laterally approaching.
- **Trajectory**: Continues stable approach in both dimensions.
- **TTC Calculation (Longitudinal)**: 20.64m / 2.55 m/s = approximately 8.09 seconds
- **MDC**: > 5.0m
- **Risk Score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)

#### Obstacle 30727 (Front-Right)
- **Adjusted Distance**: longitudinal 12.83m, lateral 7.98m
- **Relative Velocity**: longitudinal 5.65 m/s (moving away), lateral -3.43 m/s
- **Motion Description**: Moving away longitudinally & laterally.
- **Trajectory**: Increasing distance in both directions.
- **TTC and MDC**: Not applicable due to divergence.
- **Risk Score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)

#### Obstacle 30735 (Front-Right)
- **Adjusted Distance**: longitudinal 0.27m, lateral 15.02m
- **Relative Velocity**: longitudinal -1.31 m/s (driving toward), lateral -5.59 m/s
- **Motion Description**: Driving toward longitudinally, moving away laterally.
- **Performance:**
  - **TTC Calculation (Longitudinal)**: 0.27m / 1.31 m/s = approximately 0.21 seconds
  - **MDC**: Near 0m in longitudinal within short time span (due to low velocity)
  - **Risk Score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)

#### Obstacle 30739 (Front-Right)
- **Adjusted Distance**: longitudinal 0.72m, lateral 3.35m
- **Relative Velocity**: longitudinal 4.31 m/s (moving away)
- **Motion Description**: Moving away longitudinally.
- **Performance:**
  - **TTC and MDC**: Moving away; long distance ensures safety.
  - **Risk Score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)

#### Obstacle 30749 (Behind)
- **Adjusted Distance**: longitudinal -0.74m, lateral 0.00m
- **Relative Velocity**: longitudinal 2.98 m/s (approaching)
- **Motion Description**: Driving toward the ego car longitudinally.
- **Performance:**
  - Despite negative distance initially indicating it is behind, rapid approach suggests interception.
  - **TTC Calculation (Longitudinal)**: |-0.74m| / 2.98 m/s = approximately 0.25 seconds
  - **MDC**: Approaching 0m in longitudinal
  - **Risk Score**: 0 (Collision)

#### Obstacle 30750 (Front-Left)
- **Adjusted Distance**: longitudinal 6.16m, lateral 4.75m
- **Relative Velocity**: longitudinal -2.55 m/s
- **Motion Description**: Driving toward the ego car longitudinally.
- **Trajectory**: Approaching steadily.
- **TTC Calculation (Longitudinal)**: 6.16m / 2.55 m/s = approximately 2.41 seconds
- **MDC**: 1.08m over time frame
- **Risk Score**: 3 (Medium Risk)

#### Obstacle 30751 (Rear-Right)
- **Adjusted Distance**: longitudinal -17.67m, lateral -7.66m
- **Relative Velocity**: longitudinal -0.27 m/s (moving away)
- **Motion Description**: Moving away essential direction.
- **Performance**:
  - **TTC and MDC**: Not approaching.
  - **Risk Score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)

#### Obstacle 30759 (Front-Left)
- **Adjusted Distance**: longitudinal 3.25m, lateral 14.76m
- **Relative Velocity**: longitudinal -2.62 m/s, lateral -1.26 m/s
- **Motion Description**: Driving toward longitudinally and laterally.
- **Trajectory**: Continues approach.
- **TTC Calculation (Longitudinal)**: 3.25m / 2.62 m/s = approximately 1.24 seconds
- **MDC**: Just under 1.0m soon
- **Risk Score**: 2 (High Risk)

This analysis concludes that obstacle 30749 poses an imminent collision risk due to rapid approach from the rear with a negligible longitudinal distance. Obstacle 30735 is at extreme risk due to its proximity despite low lateral interference. Finally, 30759 is a high-risk obstacle, approaching both longitudinally and laterally, demanding attention.
