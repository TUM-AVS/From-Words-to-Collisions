At t=10.2s, the ego vehicle at (207.1113, 92.1102) is analyzed for potential collisions with the provided obstacles.  Obstacle 30739 at (208.1388, 84.014) poses the most significant risk. While not an immediate collision, its trajectory suggests a rapidly increasing risk in the next few timesteps given its proximity and continued movement towards the ego vehicle's predicted path. Obstacle 30749 (203.7265, 95.248) also presents a potential risk due to its proximity. However, the separation distance combined with the ego vehicle's and obstacle's trajectories indicate it has a lower short term risk than 30739. No other obstacle poses a risk score of 0 or 1.
