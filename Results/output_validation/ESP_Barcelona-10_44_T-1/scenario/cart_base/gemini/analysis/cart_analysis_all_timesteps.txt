At t=10.2s, Ego (30743.0) is at (207.11, 92.11) in lanelet 3002.0, velocity 2.73 m/s.  Several obstacles are nearby and moving, requiring analysis.

* **Obstacle 30739.0:** Located at (208.14, 84.01) in lanelet 3003.0 with velocity 7.46 m/s.  While not immediately colliding, its trajectory and relatively high speed compared to Ego, combined with the close proximity, represent a high risk if its lane intersects with Ego's current lane (3002.0) within the near future.  Lanelet information is crucial to determine precise risk.  Provisionally high risk (2) due to the need for more lanelet context.

* **Obstacle 30749.0:** Positioned at (203.73, 95.25) in lanelet 2998.0, velocity 5.87 m/s. The y-coordinate difference is small (95.25 vs. 92.11), suggesting proximity in one dimension. The x-coordinate difference and distinct lanelets suggest possible merging/lane change scenario. Without clear lanelet connectivity info, the risk remains provisionally high (2) needing further context.

* **Obstacle 30758.0:** At (195.61, 103.43) in lanelet 2998.0 (same as 30749.0), velocity 4.95 m/s. Similar x-coordinate, but larger y-coordinate difference compared to Ego, suggests possible safe following distance, depending on exact lane geometry. Lanelet information is needed to definitively classify the risk, making it provisionally medium (3).
