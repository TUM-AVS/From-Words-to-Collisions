### Safety Analysis for Most Recent Timestep (10.2s)

#### Key Observations:
1. **Ego Vehicle**: 
   - Position: (207.1113, 92.1102)
   - Velocity: 2.7307 m/s (increasing)
   - Lanelet: 3002.0

2. **Obstacle Proximity**:
   - Obstacles 30741, 30739, 30740, 30744, 30753, and 30754 are in adjacent lanelets (3000-3007) and moving towards ego's trajectory.
   - Obstacle 30741 (ID: 30741) is particularly close with position (201.6295, 87.2593) and velocity 5.323 m/s (converging path).

3. **Critical Obstacles**:
   - **Obstacle 30741**: 
     - Distance: ~5.5m from ego
     - Relative velocity: ~2.6 m/s (approaching)
     - TTC: ~2.1s (High Risk)
   - **Obstacle 30739**: 
     - Distance: ~8.5m
     - Relative velocity: ~4.7 m/s
     - TTC: ~1.8s (Extreme Risk)

### Obstacle Analysis (Selected Critical Obstacles):

#### Obstacle ID: 30739
- **Distance Risk**: Rapidly closing distance from 9.3s to 10.2s (from ~15m to ~8.5m). Directly ahead in adjacent lane.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 2 (High Risk)
- **Time Risk**: TTC ~1.8s with increasing relative velocity.
- **Time Safety Score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)
- **Overall Risk Score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)

#### Obstacle ID: 30741
- **Distance Risk**: Consistently moving towards ego's path (distance reduced from ~10m to ~5.5m).
- **Distance Safety Score**: 3 (Medium Risk)
- **Time Risk**: TTC ~2.1s with stable acceleration.
- **Time Safety Score**: 2 (High Risk)
- **Overall Risk Score**: 2 (High Risk)

#### Obstacle ID: 30744
- **Distance Risk**: Moving parallel but closing laterally (distance ~7m).
- **Distance Safety Score**: 3 (Medium Risk)
- **Time Risk**: TTC >3s.
- **Time Safety Score**: 3 (Medium Risk)
- **Overall Risk Score**: 3 (Medium Risk)

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. **Collision Check**: No obstacles are in the exact same lanelet as ego (3002.0), but several are in adjacent lanelets with converging paths.
2. **Trajectory Analysis**: Obstacle 30739 shows the most aggressive convergence (high velocity + acceleration).
3. **Risk Assessment**: Extreme risk due to low TTC (<2s) for Obstacle 30739. No immediate collision (score 0) but imminent danger.
