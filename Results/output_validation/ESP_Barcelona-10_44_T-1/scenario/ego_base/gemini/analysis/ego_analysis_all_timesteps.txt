Obstacle 30749 is very close to the ego vehicle longitudinally (-0.11m) and moving towards the ego vehicle (2.21 m/s), indicating a very high risk of collision in the next timestep.

Obstacle 30759 is also quite close to the ego vehicle (2.59m longitudinally) and moving towards the ego vehicle (-2.79 m/s longitudinally), posing a high risk. The lateral distance (14.60m) and movement (-1.07 m/s) suggest this obstacle might not directly collide but requires attention.

Obstacle 30735 is very close longitudinally (0.11m) and moving towards the ego vehicle, but it is far laterally (-16.14m) and moving away from the ego vehicle laterally (-5.96 m/s) suggesting its motion is more likely cutting across the ego vehicle's front path. This still represents a high risk due to the longitudinal proximity.

Obstacle 30736 is relatively close (3.20m longitudinally) and moving toward the ego vehicle (-0.47 m/s longitudinally). It is further away laterally (-12.72m) and moving away laterally (-6.46 m/s). It's still close enough to require attention.


**Risk Levels and Definitions:**
<Collision (Score: 0)>: Actual collision has occurred or is unavoidable within the next timestep.
<Extreme Risk (Score: 1)>: Immediate collision or very high likelihood of impact. Urgent action is required.
<High Risk (Score: 2)>: Close to collision or highly probable collision path. Needs prompt attention and quick manoeuvring.
<Medium Risk (Score: 3)>: Moderate collision risk but manageable with timely reactions and proper strategies.
<Low Risk (Score: 4)>: Minimal collision risk. The situation is controllable with sufficient time to react.
<Negligible Risk (Score: 5)>: No significant collision risk. Obstacles are either moving away or far enough not to interfere.

  "ScenarioAnalysis": {
    "IsCollisionScenario": false,
    "Reasoning": "Obstacle 30749 poses an extreme risk of collision in the next timestep due to its proximity and velocity relative to the ego vehicle. While no collision has occurred yet, immediate action is required to avoid impact. Obstacles 30759, 30735, and 30736 present high risks due to their longitudinal proximity and relative motion towards the ego vehicle, necessitating careful monitoring and potential evasive maneuvers."
