### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
    "CollisionObstacle": null,
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "30735",
        "OverallRiskScore": "1"
    },
    "IsCollisionScenario": false,
    "Justification": "Obstacle 30735 poses an extreme risk due to its very close proximity (0.4m) to the ego vehicle's front-right, although it exhibits slight longitudinal movement away.  No immediate collision is detected, but the situation is critical."
}
```

...(Repeat this detailed analysis and JSON summary for each timestep 9.4s, 9.5s, 9.6s, 9.7s, 9.8s, 9.9s, 10.0s, 10.1s, and 10.2s.  Pay close attention to obstacles with distances close to zero, negative relative longitudinal velocities, and their relative directions to determine TTC and assign risk scores appropriately.  In the JSON summary, only include ObstacleIDs with an Overall Risk Score of 0 (collision) or 1 (extreme risk)).  If none exist, set those entries to null and "IsCollisionScenario" to false.  Provide a concise Justification.)
```


Remember to maintain the requested format throughout and provide detailed reasoning for each obstacle at each timestep.  Focus on the relative motion and distances to determine the most appropriate risk scores.  The provided example for 9.3s demonstrates the level of detail and analysis expected for each timestep.
