### Analysis per Obstacle

Let's analyze each obstacle based on the scenario context and the final timestamp at 10.2 seconds. We have used adjusted distance values for the analysis here.

#### Obstacle 30717
- **Position:** Front-left
- **Adjusted Distances:** Longitudinal 19.62 m, Lateral 5.13 m
- **Relative Velocity:** Longitudinal -2.73 m/s
- **MDC Calculation:** 19.62 m
- **TTC Calculation:** TTC along longitudinal direction = 19.62 / 2.73 ≈ 7.19 seconds
- **Risk Assessment:** No Risk (5), as both the longitudinal MDC and TTC indicate a relatively safe distance, and the lateral component is stable.

#### Obstacle 30735
- **Position:** Front-right
- **Adjusted Distances:** Longitudinal 0.11 m, Lateral 16.14 m
- **Relative Velocity:** Longitudinal -1.73 m/s
- **MDC Calculation:** 0.11 m (critical)
- **TTC Calculation:** Longitudinal direction = 0.11 / 1.73 ≈ 0.06 seconds (critical)
- **Risk Assessment:** Extreme Risk (1), due to extremely low MDC and very short TTC.

#### Obstacle 30736
- **Position:** Front-right
- **Adjusted Distances:** Longitudinal 3.20 m, Lateral 12.72 m
- **Relative Velocity:** Longitudinal -0.47 m/s
- **MDC Calculation:** 3.20 m
- **TTC Calculation:** Longitudinal direction = 3.20 / 0.47 ≈ 6.81 seconds
- **Risk Assessment:** No Risk (5), sufficient distance and safe trajectory.

#### Obstacle 30749
- **Position:** Behind
- **Adjusted Distance:** Longitudinal -0.11 m
- **Relative Velocity:** Longitudinal 3.12 m/s
- **MDC Calculation:** Critical alignment
- **TTC Calculation:** Not applicable as the obstacle is behind, but negative longitudinal distance suggests it is dangerously close.
- **Risk Assessment:** Collision (0), as the obstacle is exactly aligned longitudinally and very close to the ego vehicle from behind, indicating a possible impact.

#### Obstacle 30750
- **Position:** Front-left
- **Adjusted Distances:** Longitudinal 5.59 m, Lateral 4.84 m
- **Relative Velocity:** Longitudinal -2.73 m/s
- **MDC Calculation:** 5.59 m
- **TTC Calculation:** Longitudinal direction = 5.59 / 2.73 ≈ 2.05 seconds
- **Risk Assessment:** Medium Risk (3), close-range conflict potential.

### Conclusion of Collision Scenario
From the analysis, Obstacle 30749 poses a direct collision threat as it is aligned at a very close negative distance behind the ego vehicle. Additionally, Obstacle 30735 presents extreme risk, given the very low MDC and short TTC in the front-right diagonal positioning.
