Analysis:

Obstacle 30716: This obstacle is in the same lane as the ego vehicle (lanelet 487).  While the obstacle's velocity is higher than the ego vehicle's, it is moving roughly parallel to the ego vehicle, and the distance between them is not drastically decreasing over the observed time steps.  Though a collision is not imminent in the observed timeframe, the relatively small lateral distance suggests that this obstacle poses a high risk. Risk score: 2.

Obstacle 30720: This obstacle starts in lanelet 484 and transitions to lanelet 3115.  It does not appear to pose a direct risk to the ego vehicle in the observed time steps.  The y-coordinates indicate that there is sufficient lateral separation. Risk score: 5.
