Obstacle 30716 is in the same lane as the ego vehicle and is traveling significantly faster. While the distance between them is currently relatively safe, Obstacle 30716's fluctuating acceleration suggests unpredictable behavior.  It's important to note the closing velocity, as a continued acceleration differential could create a high-risk situation in the near future. However, based on the current trajectory and assuming no drastic changes in either vehicle's behavior, there isn't an immediate collision risk. Therefore, its risk score is 3 (Medium Risk).

Obstacle 30720 is initially in a neighboring lane (484) and then transitions to another lane (3115). The lateral movement suggests a lane change maneuver.  Although it has a slightly fluctuating acceleration, the change of lanes separates it from the ego vehicle's path, reducing the risk of collision. Its changing lanelet IDs suggest a less predictable trajectory.  Overall, given the lateral separation and the observed behavior, this obstacle presents a Low Risk (4).
