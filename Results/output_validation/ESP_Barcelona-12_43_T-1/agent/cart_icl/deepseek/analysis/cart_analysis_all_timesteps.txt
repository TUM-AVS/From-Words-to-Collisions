### Analysis:

1. **Obstacle 30716 (Same Lanelet 487.0 as Ego):**
   - **Relative Position:** The obstacle is ahead of the ego vehicle but closing the distance rapidly.
   - **Relative Velocity:** The obstacle's velocity (~11.6 m/s) is significantly higher than the ego's (~7.86 m/s), and the acceleration trends show fluctuations but generally positive.
   - **TTC Calculation:** At 12.8s, the longitudinal distance is ~3.76m (ego: -482.3257, obstacle: -478.5608). Relative velocity = 11.8072 - 7.8565 = 3.9507 m/s. TTC = 3.76 / 3.9507 â‰ˆ 0.95s.
   - **Lateral Distance:** Minimal (same lanelet), indicating high risk of collision.
   - **Risk Assessment:** **Extreme Risk (1)** due to high closing speed and minimal TTC.

2. **Obstacle 30720 (Lanelet 3115.0):**
   - **Relative Position:** The obstacle is in a different lanelet (3115.0) and moving away laterally.
   - **Relative Velocity:** The obstacle's velocity (~11.1 m/s) is higher than the ego's, but the lateral separation reduces risk.
   - **TTC Calculation:** Not directly relevant due to lateral separation.
   - **Risk Assessment:** **Low Risk (4)** as the obstacle is not on a collision course.
