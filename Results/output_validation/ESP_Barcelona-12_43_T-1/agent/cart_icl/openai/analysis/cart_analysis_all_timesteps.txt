### Analysis for 12.8 seconds:

#### Ego Vehicle:
- Position: (-482.3257, 324.4348)
- Velocity: 7.8565 m/s
- Lanelet: 487.0

#### Obstacle 30716.0:
- Position: (-478.5608, 328.1307)
- Velocity: 11.8072 m/s
- Lanelet: 487.0
- **Relative Position**: Approximately 4 meters in front of the ego vehicle.
- **Relative Velocity**: Ego is slower, closing distance increases.
- **Analysis**: Since both vehicles are in the same lanelet and the distance is roughly around 4 meters with obstacle accelerating slightly, this represents a high-risk situation if no action is taken.

#### Obstacle 30720.0:
- Position: (-466.164, 340.3022)
- Velocity: 11.1567 m/s
- Lanelet: 3115.0
- **Relative Position**: Approximately 16 meters away laterally, due to differences in lane.
- **Analysis**: Despite similar velocities, the lateral distance reduces the risk significantly. 

### Risk Assessment:

1. **Obstacle 30716.0**:
   - Position ahead with substantial closing velocity despite a slightly large distance.
   - **Overall Risk Score**: 2 (High Risk)

2. **Obstacle 30720.0**:
   - Different lane and significant lateral distance.
   - **Overall Risk Score**: 4 (Low Risk)

### Conclusion:

- **Obstacle 30716.0** exhibits high risk due to proximity and speed differential despite being ahead, necessitating careful action from the driving system to prevent escalation to an immediate threat.
