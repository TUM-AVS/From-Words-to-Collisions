### Safety analysis for timestep 12.8s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

**Assumptions and Clarifications:**

* Since the provided scenario only includes relative longitudinal and lateral distances and velocities, and lacks information about the ego vehicle's and obstacles' dimensions, accurate TTC and MDC calculations are not feasible.  We will rely heavily on proximity and relative velocity trends to make qualitative assessments.
* "Behind" and lateral distances suggest the obstacles are somewhat diagonally behind the ego vehicle.
* We'll assume a simplified vehicle width of 2 meters for illustrative purposes in distance assessment, though a precise width isn't given.  This means the adjusted longitudinal distance, especially for close objects, should be increased by approximately 1 meter to account for the rear extent of the ego vehicle.

### Obstacle Analysis:

**- Obstacle ID: 30716**
- Distance Risk reason:  Obstacle 30716 is extremely close (-0.77m longitudinal, -0.77m lateral) and rapidly approaching.  Adjusting for ego vehicle length, the effective longitudinal separation is dangerously small, less than a meter. The lateral offset is also minimal meaning a direct collision is highly probable.
- Distance safety score: 1 (Extreme Risk)
- Time Risk reason: The high closing velocity and minimal separation indicate a TTC of well under a second.  
- Time safety score: 1 (Extreme Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 1 (Extreme Risk - imminent collision likely)

**- Obstacle ID: 30720**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 30720, while approaching, is significantly further behind (-18.14m longitudinal, -18.14m lateral) than 30716. This provides a reasonable safety buffer.
- Distance safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
- Time Risk reason:  Although approaching, the greater distance gives substantially more time to react compared to 30716.  The TTC is likely over 5 seconds at the current closing velocity, but without precise accelerations, this is an estimate.
- Time safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 4 (Low Risk)
