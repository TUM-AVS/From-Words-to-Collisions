Obstacle 30716 Analysis:
- Trajectory: This obstacle has been consistently approaching the ego vehicle from behind, with the longitudinal distance decreasing across all timesteps. Lateral distance remains at 0.00m, indicating alignment in the same lane.
- At 12.8 seconds:
    - Longitudinal distance: -0.77m (very close)
    - Lateral distance: 0.00m (same lane)
    - Relative longitudinal velocity: 3.95 m/s (closing rapidly)
    - TTC (longitudinal): 0.77m / 3.95 m/s = 0.195 seconds (EXTREME RISK)
    - MDC: Approximately 0.77m (EXTREME RISK)
    - Overall Risk: 1 (Extreme Risk)

Obstacle 30720 Analysis:
- Trajectory: This obstacle is also approaching from behind but at a greater distance than obstacle 30716.  The longitudinal distance is steadily decreasing across the timesteps. Lateral distance remains at 0.00m, meaning it's in the same lane.
- At 12.8 seconds:
    - Longitudinal distance: -18.14m
    - Lateral distance: 0.00m
    - Relative longitudinal velocity: 3.30 m/s (closing)
    - TTC (longitudinal): 18.14m / 3.30 m/s = 5.50 seconds (No Risk)
    - MDC: Approximately 18.14m (No Risk)
    - Overall Risk: 5 (No Risk)


Final Assessment:
Obstacle 30716 presents an Extreme Risk of collision due to the very short TTC (0.195 seconds) and close proximity (-0.77m longitudinally). Obstacle 30720 is not an immediate concern.
