To evaluate the collision risks for the ego vehicle with obstacles, I will analyze the data from the most recent timestep.

### Obstacle Analysis:

#### Obstacle 30716 Analysis:
- **Description:** Obstacle 30716 is directly behind the ego vehicle with an exact lateral alignment. It is approaching the ego vehicle rapidly with a short longitudinal distance.
- **Adjusted Distances:** Longitudinal: -0.77 m, Lateral: 0.00 m
- **Relative Velocity:** Longitudinal: 3.95 m/s, Lateral: 0.00 m/s
- **Motion:** The obstacle is driving toward the ego car; all calculations indicate a closing scenario.
- **Trajectory:** From previous timesteps, the longitudinal distance is decreasing rapidly, suggesting acceleration towards the ego.
- **TTC Calculation:** 
  \[
  TTC = \frac{0.77}{3.95} = 0.195 \text{ seconds}
  \]
- **MDC:** Near-zero because the obstacle is in the same lane with rapidly closing longitudinal distance.
- **Risk Assessment:** 
  - TTC is extremely low (<0.5s), and MDC is near zero. This suggests an extreme risk and likely imminent collision if no action is taken.
  - Overall Risk Score: **1 (Extreme Risk)**

#### Obstacle 30720 Analysis:
- **Description:** Obstacle 30720 is significantly behind and aligned with the ego vehicle. It is approaching slowly.
- **Adjusted Distances:** Longitudinal: -18.14 m, Lateral: 0.00 m
- **Relative Velocity:** Longitudinal: 3.30 m/s, Lateral: 0.03 m/s
- **Motion:** The obstacle is driving toward the ego car but at a much slower rate.
- **Trajectory:** Consistent reduction in distance but moderate rates compared to Obstacle 30716.
- **TTC Calculation:**
  \[
  TTC = \frac{18.14}{3.30} = 5.50 \text{ seconds}
  \]
- **MDC:** With a large current distance, MDC is also not concerning.
- **Risk Assessment:**
  - With TTC greater than 5 seconds and no alarming reduction in distance, the risk remains negligible at this point.
  - Overall Risk Score: **5 (Negligible Risk)**

### JSON Summary:
```json
{
    "CollisionObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "30716",
        "OverallRiskScore": "0"
    },
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "30716",
        "OverallRiskScore": "1"
    },
    "HighRiskObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "None",
        "OverallRiskScore": "None"
    }
}
```

**Conclusion:** Obstacle 30716 is at an extreme risk level and is on the verge of collision with the ego vehicle. Immediate evasive action is required to prevent the collision. Obstacle 30720 poses a negligible risk under the current conditions.
