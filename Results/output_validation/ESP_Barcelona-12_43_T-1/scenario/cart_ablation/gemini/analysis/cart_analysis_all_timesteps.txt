At t=13.0s, Ego is in lanelet 487.0 at (-483.45, 323.33) with a velocity of 7.86 m/s.

Obstacle 30716 is also in lanelet 487.0 at (-480.25, 326.47) with a velocity of 11.80 m/s.  The y-coordinate difference is approximately 3.14 meters, suggesting a potential lateral offset, but given they are in the same lanelet, a collision is unlikely. However, the x-coordinate difference is only about 3.2 meters. Obstacle 30716 is moving significantly faster than Ego.  While a collision is not imminent at this exact moment, the closing rate is high, making it a high risk situation.  If the current velocity trends continue, a collision is likely.  This is classified as a risk score of 2 (High Risk).

Obstacle 30720 is in lanelet 3115.0 at (-467.77, 338.73). The x-coordinate difference is much larger for this obstacle (around 15.68 m) as is the y-coordinate difference of 15.4 meters. This represents significantly less risk than Obstacle 30716. This is a risk score of 4 (Low Risk).
