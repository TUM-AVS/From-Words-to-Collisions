### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep (13.0 seconds):

### Obstacle Analysis:

1. **Obstacle ID: 30716 (Most Critical)**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Located in the same lanelet (487) as ego, moving towards ego with high velocity (11.8042 m/s). Distance is closing rapidly (~3m behind ego).
   - **Distance safety score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: TTC ≈ 0.25s (distance/relative velocity = 3m/(11.8-7.85)m/s). Acceleration trend shows deceleration (-0.781 m/s²).
   - **Time safety score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)

2. **Obstacle ID: 30696**
   - Located in lanelet 477 (adjacent lane), moving parallel to ego with similar speed (10.316 m/s)
   - Overall Risk score: 3 (Medium Risk)

3. **Obstacle ID: 30695**
   - Moving fast (13.56 m/s) in lanelet 477 (adjacent lane), ahead of ego
   - Overall Risk score: 3 (Medium Risk)

4. **Obstacle ID: 30720**
   - Moving in lanelet 3115 (opposite direction), sufficient lateral distance
   - Overall Risk score: 4 (Low Risk)

5. **Other stationary/slow obstacles (30690, 30691, etc.)**
   - Either stationary or moving very slowly in non-conflicting lanelets
   - Overall Risk score: 5 (Negligible Risk)

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. Ego is in lanelet 487 moving at constant speed (7.8565 m/s)
2. Obstacle 30716 is in same lanelet, closing distance rapidly from behind
3. TTC is critically low (0.25s) - immediate evasive action needed
4. Other obstacles are either in non-conflicting paths or have sufficient distance
5. This is an extreme risk scenario but not yet a collision (no actual impact at this timestep)
