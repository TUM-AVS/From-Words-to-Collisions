### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 30716.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 30716.0 is in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle and the distance between them has been decreasing over the past several timesteps. Though not immediately colliding, the continuous approach poses a high risk.
- Distance safety score: 2
- Time Risk reason: The relative velocity between the ego vehicle and obstacle 30716.0 indicates a potential for collision if the current trend continues.  The fluctuating acceleration of the obstacle further increases the uncertainty and therefore the risk.
- Time safety score: 2
- Overall Risk score: 2

- Obstacle ID: 30720.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 30720.0 is in a different lanelet, and while moderately close, it maintains a safe lateral distance. The data shows its trajectory is not directly intersecting with the ego vehicle's path.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: The relative velocity and acceleration trends suggest the obstacle is moving somewhat parallel to the ego vehicle and not on a direct collision course in the immediate future.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4


### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. **Identify potential collision obstacles:** Focus on obstacles in the same lane as the ego vehicle (Obstacle 30716.0).
2. **Analyze trajectories:** Observe the decreasing distance between the ego vehicle and obstacle 30716.0 over the provided timesteps.
3. **Assess Risk:** The continuing approach of obstacle 30716.0, combined with its fluctuating acceleration, suggests a high risk of collision if no evasive action is taken. Obstacle 30720.0 is less of a concern due to lane separation and parallel trajectory.
4. **Conclusion:** This is not a collision scenario yet, but it has a high probability of becoming one if the current trends continue.
