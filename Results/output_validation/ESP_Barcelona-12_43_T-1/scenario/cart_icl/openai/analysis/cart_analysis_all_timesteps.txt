### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Evaluation for each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

1. **Obstacle ID: 30716**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle and has been consistently reducing its distance over time. At 13.0 seconds, it is very close to the ego vehicle, indicating a high potential for collision.
   - **Distance safety score**: 2 (High Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: Despite the changes in acceleration, the relative velocity is high, and the trend has shown consistent proximity between the ego vehicle and the obstacle. The Time to Collision (TTC) is short.
   - **Time safety score**: 2 (High Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 2 (High Risk)

2. **Obstacle ID: 30720**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is in a different lanelet, maintaining a safe distance throughout the scenario. The orientation and position suggest it is not a threat to the ego vehicle.
   - **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: The obstacle maintains a similar velocity trend and is consistently moving away relative to the ego vehicle's path.
   - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
- **Step 1**: Identify the lanelets of both obstacles relative to the ego vehicle.
- **Step 2**: Determine the relative movement trends and distances over time.
- **Step 3**: Evaluate the potential intersection based on trajectory and velocity.
- **Step 4**: Conclude risks based on proximity and potential changes in direction or speed.

The analysis reveals no collision scenario as obstacle 30716, despite being closer, remains at a manageable distance with a bit of margin, showing high risk but not collision certainty. Obstacle 30720 poses no threat due to its different lane and consistent distancing.
