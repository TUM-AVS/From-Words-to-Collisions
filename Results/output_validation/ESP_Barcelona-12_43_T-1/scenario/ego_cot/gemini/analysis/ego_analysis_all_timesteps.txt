### Safety analysis for timestep 12.1-13.0s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

Obstacle 30716 exhibits a consistent and dangerous trend of decreasing longitudinal distance to the ego vehicle throughout the provided timestamps.  The relative longitudinal velocity remains positive, indicating that the obstacle is approaching the ego vehicle rapidly.  Although the relative longitudinal acceleration fluctuates, it is not sufficient to mitigate the risk of collision. By timestamp 13.0s, a collision occurs.

Obstacle 30720 maintains a relatively safe longitudinal distance throughout the scenario. While its relative longitudinal velocity indicates approach, the distance and the fluctuating acceleration suggest a much lower risk compared to Obstacle 30716.

### Obstacle Analysis:

- Obstacle ID: 30716
- Distance Risk reason:  The longitudinal distance decreases progressively, reaching 0 at 13.0s, clearly indicating a collision.  Lateral distance is also minimal, suggesting an almost direct rear-end collision.
- Distance safety score: 0 (Collision at 13.0s)
- Time Risk reason: The consistently positive relative longitudinal velocity and decreasing longitudinal distance imply a very short TTC, culminating in collision.
- Time safety score: 0 (Collision at 13.0s)
- Overall Risk score: 0 (Collision)

- Obstacle ID: 30720
- Distance Risk reason:  Longitudinal distance remains relatively large throughout the scenario, posing no immediate threat.
- Distance safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
- Time Risk reason:  While the obstacle is approaching, the large longitudinal distance and fluctuating relative velocity and acceleration suggest sufficient time to react.
- Time safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 4 (Low Risk)
