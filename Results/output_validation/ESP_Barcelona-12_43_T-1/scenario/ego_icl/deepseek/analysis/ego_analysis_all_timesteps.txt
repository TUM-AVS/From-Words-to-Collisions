### Obstacle-by-Obstacle Analysis:

#### Obstacle 30716:
- **Position**: Collision (longitudinal 0.00m, lateral 0.00m)
- **Relative Velocity**: longitudinal 3.95 m/s (approaching), lateral 0.00 m/s
- **Motion**: Exact longitudinal and lateral alignment (collision occurring)
- **Trajectory Analysis**: 
  - From 12.1s to 13.0s, the longitudinal distance decreases from -3.48m to 0.00m with a consistent closing velocity (~3.8-4.0 m/s).
  - Lateral distance remains 0.00m throughout, indicating perfect alignment in the same lane.
  - At 13.0s, the obstacle has reached the ego vehicle (distance = 0.00m in both dimensions).
- **TTC**: 0.00s (collision is occurring)
- **MDC**: 0.00m (collision is occurring)
- **Risk Score**: 0 (Collision)

#### Obstacle 30720:
- **Position**: Behind (longitudinal -17.47m, lateral 0.00m)
- **Relative Velocity**: longitudinal 3.40 m/s (approaching), lateral 0.01 m/s
- **Motion**: Driving toward the ego car from behind, exact lateral alignment
- **Trajectory Analysis**:
  - From 12.1s to 13.0s, the longitudinal distance decreases from -20.38m to -17.47m with a closing velocity (~3.1-3.4 m/s).
  - Lateral distance remains 0.00m, indicating same-lane alignment.
  - The obstacle is still far behind (17.47m) and not an immediate threat.
- **TTC**: 17.47 / 3.40 â‰ˆ 5.14s (> 5.0s, No Risk)
- **MDC**: 17.47m (> 5.0m, No Risk)
- **Risk Score**: 5 (No Risk)

---

### Final Determination:
- **Collision Scenario**: Yes, because Obstacle 30716 has a risk score of 0 (collision occurring).
- **Justification**: Obstacle 30716 has reached the ego vehicle (distance = 0.00m in both dimensions) with a closing velocity, confirming a collision. Obstacle 30720 is far behind and poses no immediate risk.
