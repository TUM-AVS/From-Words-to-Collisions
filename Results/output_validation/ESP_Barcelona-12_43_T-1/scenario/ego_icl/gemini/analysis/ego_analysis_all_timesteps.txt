* **Obstacle 30716 Analysis:**

This obstacle is behind the ego vehicle and approaching rapidly along the longitudinal axis.  The lateral distance remains consistently at 0.00m across all timesteps, indicating a perfect alignment in the same lane. This does not automatically mean a collision, but requires close examination of the longitudinal motion.

* Trajectory Analysis:  Obstacle 30716 consistently decreases its distance to the ego vehicle across all timesteps.  The longitudinal distance goes from -3.48m to 0.00m in the final timestep. This confirms a collision.

* TTC Calculation (at 13.0s): Since a collision occurs at 13.0 seconds, TTC = 0

* MDC Calculation (at 13.0s): MDC = 0.00m

* Risk Assessment:  Collision Risk (0).

* **Obstacle 30720 Analysis:**

This obstacle is also behind the ego vehicle, but at a much safer distance.  It also maintains a consistent lateral distance of 0.00m, meaning it's traveling in the same lane as the ego vehicle.

* Trajectory Analysis: The obstacle is approaching the ego vehicle, but at a relatively slow rate compared to Obstacle 30716.  

* TTC Calculation (at 13.0s): TTC = distance / relative_velocity = 17.47m / 3.40 m/s â‰ˆ 5.14 seconds

* MDC Calculation (at 13.0s): Since the lateral distance is 0.00m, MDC is based on longitudinal distance and trajectory, therefore, approximately 17.47m

* Risk Assessment: Since both TTC > 5s and MDC > 5m, the Risk score is No Risk (5).


* **Collision Scenario Determination:**

Yes, this is a collision scenario. Obstacle 30716 collides with the ego vehicle at t=13.0s.
