### Obstacle Analysis:

#### Obstacle 30716:
- **Trajectory and Position Analysis**:
  - At 13.0s, obstacle 30716 is in direct collision with the ego vehicle, with both longitudinal and lateral distances at 0.00 meters.
  - In the previous seconds, the obstacle was closing in on the ego from behind with velocities consistently indicating convergence.
  - Adjusted longitudinal and lateral distances decrease linearly to zero, indicating direct collision.

- **Relative Velocity and Acceleration**:
  - Relative velocity is consistently positive, indicating the obstacle is approaching the ego vehicle quickly.
  - Despite periodic decelerations, overall trajectory remains convergent.

- **TTC and MDC Calculations**:
  - TTC calculation is irrelevant at collision point as distance is 0.00m.
  - MDC is effectively 0.00m, indicating an ongoing collision.

- **Risk Assessment**:
  - Based on 13.0s data, Obstacle 30716 scores a risk of 0 (Collision), as the collision is confirmed with both distances at zero.

#### Obstacle 30720:
- **Trajectory and Position Analysis**:
  - At 13.0s, obstacle 30720 remains behind the ego vehicle with an adjusted longitudinal distance of -17.47m.
  - The obstacle is aligned laterally (0.00m), but the longitudinal distance remains significantly negative and is not closing rapidly towards zero.

- **Relative Velocity and Acceleration**:
  - Relative velocity indicates a slow approach, and recent decelerations further suggest reduced closing potential.
  
- **TTC and MDC Calculations**:
  - TTC calculation: \( \text{TTC} = \frac{17.47}{3.40} \approx 5.14 \) seconds
  - MDC calculation: Analyzing trends, the MDC likely remains above 5 meters considering trajectory and alignment.
  
- **Risk Assessment**:
  - Based on consistently high longitudinal distance and slowing approach, Obstacle 30720 scores a risk of 5 (No Risk).

### Conclusion
- **Scenario Evaluation**: Among the two analyzed obstacles, obstacle 30716 is currently colliding with the ego vehicle.
- **Determination**: This scenario qualifies as a collision scenario due to Obstacle 30716 having a risk score of 0.
