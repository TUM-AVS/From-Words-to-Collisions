### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 30716
- Relative Direction: Behind
- Distance Risk Reason: The obstacle is very close behind the ego vehicle (0.0m longitudinally), indicating a collision.  The lateral distance is 0.0, meaning it's directly behind. The trend over the past timesteps shows a consistent decrease in longitudinal distance, leading to the current collision state.
- Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 0
- Lateral Distance Safety Score: 5
- Overall Distance Safety Score: 0.0 
- Time Risk Reason: The longitudinal TTC is 0.0, confirming the collision. The lateral TTC is irrelevant in this "Behind" scenario as the longitudinal component dominates. The trend from previous timesteps showed a rapidly decreasing TTC, as expected with an imminent rear-end collision.
- Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 0
- Lateral Time Safety Score: 5
- Overall Time Safety Score: 0.0
- Overall Risk Score: 0

- Obstacle ID: 30720
- Relative Direction: Behind
- Distance Risk Reason: The obstacle is 17.47m behind the ego vehicle, representing a safe longitudinal distance. Lateral distance is 0.0m, which is not a concern in this rear scenario.  The obstacle has been approaching over the past timesteps, but is still far enough away to not pose an immediate risk.
- Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 5
- Lateral Distance Safety Score: 5
- Overall Distance Safety Score: 5.0
- Time Risk Reason: The longitudinal TTC is 5.14s, a comfortable margin.  Lateral TTC is 0.0, which is not a factor in this longitudinal ("Behind") scenario. The TTC has been decreasing over the past timesteps, indicating the closing speed, but it is still well within a safe threshold.
- Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 5
- Lateral Time Safety Score: 5
- Overall Time Safety Score: 5.0
- Overall Risk Score: 5
