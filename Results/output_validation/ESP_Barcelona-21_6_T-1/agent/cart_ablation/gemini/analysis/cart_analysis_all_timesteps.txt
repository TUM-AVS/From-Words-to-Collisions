Here's the analysis of the provided scenario:

**Obstacle 30681:** This obstacle is in the same lane as the ego vehicle (lanelet 196).  Over the provided time steps, the distance between the ego vehicle and this obstacle decreases slightly.  While the vehicles are getting closer, the rate is slow and the velocities suggest they are both decelerating.  There is enough time and space for the ego vehicle to react and maintain a safe distance. This obstacle represents a *Medium Risk (3)* initially. As the scenario progresses and both vehicles continue decelerating, the risk lowers further to *Low Risk (4)*.

**Obstacle 30685:** This obstacle is in a different lane (lanelet 53). Its trajectory and the ego vehicle's trajectory do not intersect within the given timeframe. The lateral distance between the vehicles is also large and safe.  Therefore, this obstacle poses a *Negligible Risk (5)*.

Based on the analysis, there are no collisions or extreme risks.
