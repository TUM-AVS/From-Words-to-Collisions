To analyze the collision risk of the given scenario, let's follow the criteria mentioned above:

### Analysis of Obstacles:

1. **Obstacle 30681.0:**

   - This obstacle is in the same lanelet as the Ego vehicle throughout the observation period.
   - The positions at different timesteps suggest the relative motion is consistent, running parallel to the Ego vehicle path.
   - At 9.6 seconds, the distance between the Ego vehicle and this obstacle is approximately √((-232.64 - (-229.0069))² + (337.9012 - 334.5101)²) ≈ 4.62 meters.
   - The relative velocity between the Ego (4.2359 m/s) and obstacle (2.9819 m/s) suggests the Ego vehicle is faster.
   - The proximity and speed difference demand a cautious evaluation. Given the proximity and similar directions, there's a significant risk, though an immediate collision isn't yet unavoidable. This would be a **Medium Risk (3)**.

2. **Obstacle 30685.0:**

   - This obstacle has been moving in a different lanelet (lanelet 53.0), maintaining a significant distance from the Ego vehicle.
   - The orientation and velocity suggest it's moving away from the danger zone of the Ego.
   - The position difference between the Ego and this obstacle at 9.0 seconds is significant (over 20 meters) in a different lanelet, rendering it a **Negligible Risk (5)**.

### JSON Output Preparation:

Since no obstacles are identified as "Collision" or "Extreme Risk" based on their respective definitions, our primary candidate is Obstacle 30681.0 as High Risk:

```json
{
    "CollisionObstacles": [],
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null,
    "HighRiskObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "30681.0",
        "OverallRiskScore": 2
    }
}
```

In this scenario, extra caution is warranted for Obstacle 30681.0 as it is in the same lanelet and its proximity indicates a high need for active monitoring or maneuvers by the autonomous system to mitigate collision risk.
