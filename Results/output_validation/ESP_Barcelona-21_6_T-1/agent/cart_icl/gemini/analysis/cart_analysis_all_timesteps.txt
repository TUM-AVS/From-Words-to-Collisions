At timestamp 9.6s, ego vehicle 30684.0 is located at (-232.64, 337.9012) with a velocity of 4.2359 m/s and an orientation of -0.7498 radians.

Obstacle 30681.0 is at (-229.0069, 334.5101) with a velocity of 2.9819 m/s and an orientation of -0.7512 radians.  This obstacle is in the same lanelet (196) as the ego vehicle. The x-coordinate difference suggests it is slightly ahead of the ego vehicle and the y-coordinate difference indicates it's in a neighboring lane. The similar orientations suggest both are moving in roughly the same overall direction. Due to the relatively small differences in position and the fact both are moving forward, a more detailed analysis is needed with TTC and MDC over multiple timesteps to precisely quantify the risk, but it appears low.

Obstacle 30685.0, we only have data up to 9.0 seconds, so we cannot assess the risk at 9.6 seconds accurately without more information.  Since this is an incomplete trajectory, we will disregard this obstacle in the final risk assessment.


Based on the available data, there are no immediate collision risks. The following JSON output reflects the risk assessment at the last timestamp 9.6 seconds where we have information for both ego and obstacle:
