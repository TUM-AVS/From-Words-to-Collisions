To evaluate the risk level of the two obstacles relative to the ego vehicle, let's analyze the most recent step at 9.6 seconds, using the data from previous timesteps to assess motion trends:

### Analysis for Each Obstacle:

1. **Obstacle 30681.0**
   - Current Position: (-229.0069, 334.5101)
   - Previous Position (9.5s): (-229.2242, 334.7130)
   - Lanelet: 196.0 (same as ego)
   - Relative Position: Slightly ahead to the right of the ego vehicle
   - Relative Velocity: Both vehicles are decreasing in their speed, Obstacle 30681 is at a speed of 2.9819 m/s versus the ego vehicle's 4.2359 m/s.
   - TTC (approximately based on positions): Neither overtake imminent nor collision trajectory apparent. The rate of change of x and y coordinates suggests slight separation over time.
   - MDC: Lateral separation is not negligible but is not decreasing at a concerning rate.

2. **Obstacle 30685.0**
   - Not present in the latest timestep (update scope no further output data).

### Risk Evaluation:

- **Obstacle 30681.0** is in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle. However, given its trajectory and relative position changes, the risk appears to be **Manageable** with system/driver intervention should the trajectory start converging again, hence not currently at a Risk Level 0 (Collision) or a Risk Level 1 (Extreme Risk).

Based on this latest assessment, there is no imminent collision, and none of the obstacles placed an urgent or extreme risk situation where immediate action without further observation is necessary.
