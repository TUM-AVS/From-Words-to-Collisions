At timestamp 9.6 seconds, obstacle 30681 is at a longitudinal distance of 0.46 meters and a lateral distance of 0.00 meters from the ego vehicle.  The relative longitudinal velocity is -1.25 m/s, indicating the obstacle is moving towards the ego vehicle. Given the very small distance and the closing velocity, a collision is imminent.

Obstacle 30685 is not present in the last provided timestep, so it is assumed to be no longer a relevant factor in the immediate risk assessment.

Based on the MDC (0.46m < 0.5m) and the short time to collision (TTC < 0.5, highly likely given the distance and speed), obstacle 30681 presents an *extreme risk* of collision (OverallRiskScore = 1).
