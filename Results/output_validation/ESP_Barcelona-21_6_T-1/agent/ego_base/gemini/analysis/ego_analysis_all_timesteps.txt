At t=9.6s, obstacle 30681 is located in front of the ego vehicle at a longitudinal distance of 0.46m and lateral distance of 0.00m.  The relative longitudinal velocity is -1.25 m/s, indicating that the obstacle is moving towards the ego vehicle.  The short distance combined with the negative relative velocity suggests a very high risk of collision.

Risk Levels:
0: Collision - Physical contact occurred or unavoidable
1: Extreme Risk - Immediate collision likely
2: High Risk - Close to collision, needs quick action
3: Medium Risk - Manageable with proper reaction
4: Low Risk - Minimal risk, sufficient time to react
5: Negligible Risk - No significant risk
