### Safety analysis for timestep 9.6s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

Given that the prompt emphasizes focusing on the **most recent timestep (9.6s)** and using the adjusted distances,  I'll perform the analysis based on the data at 9.6s.  However, only Obstacle 30681 information is available at 9.6s. We lack information for Obstacle 30685 at this timestep, making a complete assessment of risk impossible for that obstacle.

**Calculations and Assumptions:**

Since exact vehicle dimensions and sensor locations aren't provided, I'll make reasonable assumptions for demonstration:

* **Ego vehicle length/width:**  Assume a standard car size (approx. 4.5m long, 1.8m wide).
* **Sensor location:** Assume sensors are at the vehicle's edges.

Given the lateral and longitudinal distances are approximately equal for obstacle 30681, it implies the obstacle is positioned diagonally in front of the ego vehicle. Using Pythagorean theorem to determine the distance to corner of the ego vehicle:

* **Adjusted Longitudinal Distance (adjusted_d_long):** Raw longitudinal distance (0.46m)  - half the ego vehicle length (~2.25m) = -1.79m (negative indicates overlap/penetration).
* **Adjusted Lateral Distance (adjusted_d_lat):** Raw lateral distance (0.46m) - half the ego vehicle width (~0.9m) = -0.44m (negative indicates overlap/penetration).

**Approximate TTC (using the relative longitudinal velocity and the raw longitudinal distance):** 0.46m / 1.25m/s = 0.37s

### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 30681**
- **Distance Risk reason:**  Obstacle 30681 is extremely close to the ego vehicle's front, with negative adjusted longitudinal and lateral distances, indicating a collision is highly likely or has already occurred based on vehicle dimensions.
- **Distance safety score:** 0 (Collision)
- **Time Risk reason:** The TTC of 0.37s is less than 0.5 seconds, indicating an extremely high risk of collision.
- **Time safety score:** 1 (Extreme Risk)
- **Overall Risk score:** 0 (Collision)

- **Obstacle ID: 30685**
- **Distance Risk reason:** Insufficient information at timestep 9.6s to determine risk. While previous timesteps show the obstacle moving away longitudinally and towards the ego vehicle laterally, the position at 9.6s is unknown.
- **Distance safety score:** Not Assessable at this time.
- **Time Risk reason:** Insufficient information at timestep 9.6s to determine risk.
- **Time safety score:** Not Assessable at this time.
- **Overall Risk score:** Not Assessable at this time.
