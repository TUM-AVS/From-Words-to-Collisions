Analyzing the most recent timestep (9.6 seconds) for collision risk between the ego vehicle and obstacles:

### Obstacle 30681 Analysis
- **Current State:**
  - Position: Front of ego vehicle
  - Adjusted Distances: Longitudinal 0.46 m, Lateral 0.00 m
  - Relative Velocity: Longitudinal -1.25 m/s, Lateral 0.00 m/s
  - Evident Motion: The obstacle is driving toward the ego car longitudinally with exact lateral alignment.
  
- **Trajectory Analysis:** 
  - The relative velocity has been consistently negative and the longitudinal distance has been decreasing over previous timesteps, indicating a converging trajectory.
  
- **TTC Calculation:**
  - TTC = longitudinal distance / |relative longitudinal velocity| = 0.46 m / 1.25 m/s = 0.368 seconds
  
- **MDC Calculation:**
  - MDC is the adjusted longitudinal distance given exact lateral alignment: 0.46 meters

- **Risk Assessment:**
  - TTC = 0.368s (Extreme Risk: 1)
  - MDC = 0.46m (Extreme Risk: 1)
  - Both TTC and MDC suggest an extreme risk of collision. Given both are indicative, choose the higher risk score.

### Obstacle 30685 Analysis (Previous Time Only)
- **Previous State (9.0 seconds, last available data):**
  - Position: Rear-right of ego vehicle
  - Adjusted Distances: Longitudinal -25.12 m, Lateral -1.86 m
  - Relative Velocity: Longitudinal -4.71 m/s, Lateral 1.03 m/s
  - Evident Motion: The obstacle is moving away longitudinally but driving closer laterally from the right.
  
- **Trajectory Analysis:**
  - The longitudinal distance is increasing, and the relative longitudinal velocity confirms the obstacle is moving away.
  - Lateral distance decreasing slightly in prior data but due to unavailable 9.6-seconds data, treated as non-collision.

- **Risk Assessment Potential (Assumed from previous patterns):**
  - There was no immediate collision risk as the longitudinal position was consistently negative and moving away.
  - Lateral approach not rapid enough to suggest imminent collision unless trends change significantly.

{
  "CollisionObstacle": {
    "ObstacleID": "30681",
    "OverallRiskScore": "1"
  },
  "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {

- **Conclusion:** Obstacle 30681 poses an extreme risk (level 1) of imminent collision due to significantly reducing distance and converging trajectory despite not yet physically contacting.
