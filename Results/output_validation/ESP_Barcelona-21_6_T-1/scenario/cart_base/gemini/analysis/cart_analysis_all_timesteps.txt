At t=9.8s, Ego (30684.0) is in lanelet 196.0 at (-232.0244, 337.3271) with a velocity of 3.5081 m/s. Obstacle 30681.0 is also in lanelet 196.0 at (-228.572, 334.104) with a velocity of 2.9874 m/s.  The x-coordinates suggest a potential longitudinal collision risk as Ego is approaching Obstacle 30681.0. The difference in y-coordinates (lateral distance) is relatively small (around 3.2 meters), suggesting they are close in the same lane. While Ego's velocity is higher, it's decelerating rapidly (-2.3921 m/s²), while Obstacle 30681.0's velocity is relatively stable with minimal deceleration (-0.1741 m/s²).  This deceleration trend, observed over several timesteps, combined with the decreasing distance between Ego and Obstacle 30681.0 makes this an extremely risky situation, close to a potential collision in the next few moments.
