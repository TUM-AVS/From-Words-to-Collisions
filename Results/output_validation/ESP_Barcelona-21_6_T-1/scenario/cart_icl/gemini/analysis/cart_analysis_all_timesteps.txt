### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 30681.0
- Distance Risk reason: Both Ego and Obstacle 30681.0 are in the same lanelet (196.0).  The distance between them has decreased slightly over the observed timesteps, but they remain separated.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason:  Ego's velocity is consistently higher than Obstacle 30681.0's, but Ego is also decelerating more rapidly.  This closing velocity, combined with the proximity, poses a moderate risk.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3

- Obstacle ID: 30685.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 30685.0 is in a different lanelet (53.0) than Ego (196.0). The data provided does not indicate intersection or merging of these lanelets in the near future, and their orientations also suggest they're not directly interacting. The obstacle was last observed 0.3 seconds ago.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Given the lanelet separation and trajectories, the relative velocity poses no immediate threat. The obstacle was last observed 0.3 seconds ago.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5



### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
This is not a collision scenario.  While Obstacle 30681.0 presents a medium risk due to proximity and closing velocity, there's no indication of an immediate collision within the observed timeframe. Obstacle 30685.0 is in a different lanelet and poses no risk.
