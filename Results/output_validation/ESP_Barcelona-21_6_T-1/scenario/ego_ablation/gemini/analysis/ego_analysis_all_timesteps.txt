Obstacle 30681 is extremely close to the ego vehicle at the most recent timestep (9.8 seconds). The longitudinal distance is only 0.22 meters, indicating an imminent collision. The relative longitudinal velocity is -0.52 m/s, meaning the obstacle is still moving towards the ego vehicle, albeit slower than previous timesteps. While the relative acceleration is positive (1.62 m/sÂ²), it's unlikely to prevent a collision given the minimal remaining distance. Thus, Obstacle 30681 poses an extreme risk.

Obstacle 30685, while moving laterally towards the ego vehicle, maintains a safe longitudinal distance and doesn't present an immediate risk.
