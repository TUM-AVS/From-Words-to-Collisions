### Safety analysis for timestep 8.9s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 30681
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 30681 is very close to the ego vehicle (1.64m longitudinally and laterally) and in front, posing a high risk of collision.
- Distance safety score: 2
- Time Risk reason: The relative longitudinal velocity and decreasing distance suggest a very short time to collision.
- Time safety score: 1
- Overall Risk score: 1

- Obstacle ID: 30685
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 30685 is far behind the ego vehicle longitudinally (-24.62m) but approaching laterally.  Current lateral distance is large, but lateral velocity suggests a potential future risk.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason:  Large longitudinal distance and moving away longitudinally. While the lateral motion is concerning, it doesn't pose an immediate threat.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4


### Safety analysis for timestep 9.0s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 30681
- Distance Risk reason: Even closer than before (1.44m longitudinally and laterally).
- Distance safety score: 1
- Time Risk reason:  TTC is decreasing rapidly.
- Time safety score: 1
- Overall Risk score: 1

- Obstacle ID: 30685
- Distance Risk reason: Similar to the previous timestep. Moving away longitudinally, but slightly closer laterally.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: No immediate threat.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4



### Safety analysis for timestep 9.1s through 9.8s:
Obstacle 30681 continues to approach the ego vehicle with a decreasing longitudinal distance. Its Overall risk score remains at 1 (Extreme Risk) throughout these timesteps due to the impending collision. Obstacle 30685 maintains a safe distance longitudinally and does not pose an immediate threat, therefore Overall Risk Score is 4.  Detailed breakdowns for each timestep would follow the format above, showing the decreasing distances for obstacle 30681.


### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
  "CollisionObstacle": {
    "ObstacleID": "30681",
    "OverallRiskScore": "1"
  },
  "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {
    "ObstacleID": "30681",
    "OverallRiskScore": "1"
  },
  "IsCollisionScenario": true,
  "Justification": "Obstacle 30681 is on a direct collision course with the ego vehicle, as evidenced by the continuously decreasing longitudinal and lateral distances, and the relative velocity indicates a closing motion. While the relative acceleration fluctuates, it's not enough to avert a collision within the predicted timeframe."
