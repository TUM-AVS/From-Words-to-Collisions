### Obstacle-by-Obstacle Analysis

#### Obstacle 30681
- **Direction and Alignment**: This obstacle is directly in front of the ego vehicle with an exact lateral alignment, continuously decreasing longitudinal distance.
- **Trajectory and Movement**: From the data provided from seconds 8.9 to 9.8:
  - Longitudinal distance has reduced from 1.64 m to 0.22 m.
  - The relative velocity longitudinal component, although decreasing in magnitude, remains negative, indicating the obstacle is moving towards the ego vehicle.
  - As of the latest timestamp, the relative longitudinal velocity is -0.52 m/s.
  
- **Time-to-Collision (TTC) Calculation**: 
  - At 9.8 seconds, TTC longitudinal = 0.22 m / 0.52 m/s ≈ 0.42 seconds (assuming a constant velocity).
  
- **Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC) Calculation**: 
  - The adjusted longitudinal distance impacts MDC most critically as lateral alignment is implied.
  - MDC ≈ 0.22 m (Longitudinal proximity dominates due to exact alignment).
  
- **Risk Assessment**:
  - **Longitudinal Distance**: At 9.8 seconds, the longitudinal distance is very low (0.22 m), which is critically close.
  - **TTC**: The TTC is below 0.5 seconds, indicating an extreme risk.
  - **Risk Score**: This obstacle is at an "Extreme Risk" level with a score of 1 due to very low MDC and TTC values reflecting an imminent potential collision.

#### Obstacle 30685
- **Direction and Alignment**: Rear-right position and moving away longitudinally while moving laterally towards the ego vehicle.
- **Trajectory and Movement**: 
  - Longitudinal distance has increased slightly (from -24.62 m to -25.12 m) from seconds 8.9 to 9.0, indicating increased separation.
  - Lateral distance decreased from -2.07 m to -1.86 m (approaching laterally).
  - Relative lateral velocity is positive, indicating motion towards the ego, but the obstacle is not in close proximity.
  
- **TTC and MDC Calculation**: 
  - TTC is not applicable for longitudinal due to negative distance (moving away).
  - Lateral movement does not appear to endanger immediate collision due to larger distance.
  
- **Risk Assessment**:
  - Longitudinal and lateral distances remain large enough to avoid imminent concerns.
  - Risk Score: A score of 5 is assigned as the obstacle poses "No Risk."

### Collision Scenario Analysis
- **Obstacle 30681**'s extremely close longitudinal distance and rapid approach result in a critical situation, denoting an extreme risk with a score of 1.
- The condition aligns with criteria for a collision scenario due to the immediate potential hazard posed by Obstacle 30681.

### Conclusion
This scenario is identified as a collision scenario because Obstacle 30681, directly in front of the ego vehicle, presents an "Extreme Risk" with an imminent possibility of collision.
