### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
    - Obstacle ID: 30681
    - Relative Direction: Front
    - Distance Risk Reason: The obstacle is extremely close longitudinally (0.22m) and directly in front of the ego vehicle.  The longitudinal distance has been consistently decreasing over the past several timesteps, indicating a high probability of collision if no action is taken. Lateral distance is 0, meaning a direct frontal collision course.
    - Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 1
    - Lateral Distance Safety Score: 0
    - Overall Distance Safety Score: 1.0
    - Time Risk Reason: The longitudinal TTC is 0.41 seconds, which is extremely low.  The decreasing trend in DTClong and TTClong over previous timesteps shows an imminent collision risk. The lateral TTC is 0 indicating no lateral movement/collision risk.
    - Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 1
    - Lateral Time Safety Score: 0
    - Overall Time Safety Score: 1.0
    - Overall Risk Score: 1
