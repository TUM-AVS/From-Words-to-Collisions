Here's the collision risk analysis, considering the provided trajectory data:

**Analysis:**

* **Obstacle 30721:**  Stationary and far from the ego vehicle's trajectory. Risk score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
* **Obstacle 30723:** Stationary and far from the ego vehicle's trajectory. Risk score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
* **Obstacle 30724:** Appears at 2.6 seconds and maintains a safe distance from the ego vehicle. Risk score: 4 (Low Risk)
* **Obstacle 30726:** Moving faster than the ego vehicle but its lateral position poses no immediate threat given its current trajectory. Risk score: 4 (Low Risk)
* **Obstacle 30729:** Appears at 2.5 seconds and maintains a safe distance from the ego vehicle. Risk score: 4 (Low Risk)
* **Obstacle 30732:** Maintains a safe distance from the ego vehicle throughout the scenario. Risk score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
* **Obstacle 30733:** Accelerating but diverging away from the ego vehicleâ€™s path. Risk score: 4 (Low Risk)
* **Obstacle 30734:**  Initially closer to the ego vehicle, but its braking and ego vehicle's trajectory suggest decreasing risk over time. Risk score: 3 (Medium Risk) initially, improving to 4 by 3.4s.
* **Obstacle 30736:**  Similar to 30734 but with a slightly safer trajectory. Risk score: 4 (Low Risk)
* **Obstacle 30737:**  Moving away from the ego vehicle with ample lateral separation. Risk score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
* **Obstacle 30738:**  Traveling parallel to the ego vehicle, maintaining a safe distance. Risk score: 4 (Low Risk)
* **Obstacle 30739:** Sharing the same lane as the ego vehicle, but it appears to be moving slower than the ego vehicle and gradually creating more separation. Risk score: 3 (Medium Risk) initially, improving to 4 by 3.4s.
* **Obstacle 30740:** Appears at 3.4 seconds with sufficient lateral separation, posing no immediate risk, Risk score: 4 (Low Risk).
* **Obstacle 30741:** Moving away from the ego vehicle with ample lateral separation. Risk score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
