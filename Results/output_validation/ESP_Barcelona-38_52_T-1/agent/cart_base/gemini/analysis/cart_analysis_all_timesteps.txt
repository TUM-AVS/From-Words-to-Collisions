Here's the analysis of the provided scenario and the resulting JSON.

**Analysis:**

* **Obstacle 30721:** Stationary and far from the ego vehicle's trajectory.  Low risk (4).
* **Obstacle 30723:** Stationary and far from the ego vehicle's trajectory. Low risk (4).
* **Obstacle 30724:** Appears at t=2.6s and maintains a safe distance from the ego vehicle. Low risk (4).
* **Obstacle 30726:** Moving quickly in a different lanelet and diverging from the ego vehicle, posing no immediate threat. Low risk (4).
* **Obstacle 30729:** Exists only at t=2.5s, moving quickly in a different lanelet, and not near the ego vehicle.  Low risk (4).
* **Obstacle 30732:** Initially somewhat close and moving towards the ego vehicle, but the trajectories diverge, and the distance increases over time. Medium risk (3).
* **Obstacle 30733:** Moving quickly in a different lane and diverging from the ego vehicle over time. Low risk (4).
* **Obstacle 30734:** In the same lanelet as the ego vehicle but consistently behind it.  Its deceleration might warrant attention, but the current trajectories don't present an imminent risk. Medium risk (3).
* **Obstacle 30736:** In a neighboring lanelet and behind the ego vehicle.  Low risk (4).
* **Obstacle 30737:** Far from the ego vehicle's trajectory.  Low risk (4).
* **Obstacle 30738:** Far from the ego vehicle's trajectory.  Low risk (4).
* **Obstacle 30739:** In the same lanelet as the ego vehicle, initially ahead. However, the ego vehicle's lane change to lanelet 3089 at t=3.4 indicates a likely successful maneuver to avoid the obstacle. Low risk (4).
* **Obstacle 30740:** Appears at t=3.4s far from the ego vehicle. Low risk (4).
* **Obstacle 30741:** Far from the ego vehicle's trajectory.  Low risk (4).
