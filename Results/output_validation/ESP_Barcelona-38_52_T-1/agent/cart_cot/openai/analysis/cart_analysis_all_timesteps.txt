### Analysis

1. **Ego Vehicle (ID: 30730.0)**
   - At 3.4 seconds, the ego vehicle is slightly reducing its speed, and its overall trajectory is smooth. It has a gradual deceleration and turns slightly to the left due to the change in heading.

2. **Obstacle 30726.0**
   - This obstacle is consistently moving with relatively high speed (12.7747 units at the final step) and is located to the front-right of the ego vehicle at the latest timestamp. Its orientation suggests it's on a parallel but diverging path, but with its acceleration rate, it's moving away.

4. **Obstacle 30739.0**
   - Located directly in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle, with a velocity of 6.2313 units and decelerating consistently. The vehicle is slowing down, maintaining a stable orientation. It poses a potential risk as it is in close proximity and the same lane as the ego vehicle.
   - **Overall Risk Score: 0**
   - **Explanation:** The obstacle is in the same lane, directly in front of the ego vehicle, with low relative speed, indicating a collision risk by decelerating relatively faster. The MDC is minimal as it decelerates relative to the ego vehicle.

3. **Obstacle 30741.0**
   - The obstacle maintains a similar velocity trend to the ego vehicle, and although positioned behind the ego, it poses minimal immediate risk due to its decreasing speed trend.

For other obstacles, their positions relative to distinct lanelets or their trajectories, either perpendicular or diverging away from the ego, do not indicate any immediate risk for collision.
