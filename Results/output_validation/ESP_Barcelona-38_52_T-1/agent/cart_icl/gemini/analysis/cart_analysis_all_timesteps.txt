Obstacle 30721 and 30723 are stationary and far from the ego vehicle, posing negligible risk. Obstacle 30726 is moving fast in a different lanelet and doesn't pose an immediate threat. Obstacle 30733 is moving in a different lanelet and based on its trajectory and ego vehicle's path, there is no immediate danger.

Obstacle 30734 is in the same lane as the ego vehicle at the last timestep and its distance to the ego vehicle has been decreasing, therefore its risk level is high. Obstacle 30736 shows similar behavior as 30734, but further away from the ego vehicle, making its risk medium. Obstacle 30739 is also in the same lane as the ego vehicle, but further away than 30734 and 30736. Its risk is assessed as medium. Obstacles 30737, 30738, 30740, and 30741 are in different lanelets and don't pose an immediate risk given their current trajectories. Obstacle 30724 is not close enough to pose any risk.
