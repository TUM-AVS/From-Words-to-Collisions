At timestamp 3.4 seconds, the following obstacles present notable risks:

* **Obstacle 30723:** Located 1.96m in front and 11.19m to the left, approaching longitudinally at -1.94 m/s.  With an MDC close to 2 meters and a small positive relative longitudinal velocity and small lateral distance, this obstacle represents a **High Risk (2)**.

* **Obstacle 30732:** Situated 2.23m ahead and 19.68m to the left, moving longitudinally at -1.31 m/s and laterally at -1.33 m/s.  Given the low MDC and non-zero relative velocity, this obstacle poses a **High Risk (2)**.

* **Obstacle 30739:** Positioned 0.7m behind, approaching at 4.28 m/s.  This close proximity and approaching speed signify a **High Risk (2)**.

Other obstacles are further away or moving in a direction that doesn't pose an immediate threat.
