At t=3.4s:
- **Obstacle 30721**: Front-left, longitudinal distance 12.44m, approaching at -1.94 m/s.  Risk score: 5 (Negligible Risk).
- **Obstacle 30723**: Front-left, longitudinal distance 1.96m, approaching at -1.94 m/s. Risk score: 1 (Extreme Risk) due to the very close longitudinal distance.
- **Obstacle 30724**: Front-left, longitudinal distance 11.90m, approaching longitudinally and laterally. Risk score: 5 (Negligible Risk).
- **Obstacle 30726**: Front-right, longitudinal distance 8.89m, slowly approaching longitudinally but moving away laterally. Risk score: 5 (Negligible Risk).
- **Obstacle 30732**: Front-left, longitudinal distance 2.23m, approaching longitudinally and laterally. Risk score: 1 (Extreme Risk) due to the close longitudinal distance.
- **Obstacle 30733**: Front, longitudinal distance 9.96 m, moving away. Risk score: 5 (Negligible Risk).
- **Obstacle 30734**: Right, longitudinal distance 0.00m, lateral distance -5.42m, lateral motion towards the ego vehicle. Risk score: 2 (High Risk) due to zero longitudinal distance and lateral movement towards the ego vehicle.
- **Obstacle 30736**: Right, longitudinal distance 0.00m, lateral distance -1.90m, lateral motion towards the ego vehicle. Risk score: 2 (High Risk) due to zero longitudinal distance and lateral movement towards the ego vehicle.
- **Obstacle 30737**: Rear-right, longitudinal distance -14.39m, approaching from behind but also moving closer laterally.  Risk score: 4 (Low Risk).
- **Obstacle 30738**: Rear-left, longitudinal distance -8.37m, approaching from behind. Risk score: 4 (Low Risk).
- **Obstacle 30739**: Behind, longitudinal distance -0.70m, approaching from behind. Risk score: 2 (High Risk) because it is very close behind.
- **Obstacle 30740**: Rear-right, longitudinal distance -24.18m, approaching from behind. Risk score: 4 (Low Risk).
- **Obstacle 30741**: Behind, longitudinal distance -16.90m, approaching from behind. Risk score: 4 (Low Risk).

Risk Levels:
0: Collision - Physical contact occurred or unavoidable
1: Extreme Risk - Immediate collision likely
2: High Risk - Close to collision, needs quick action
3: Medium Risk - Manageable with proper reaction
4: Low Risk - Minimal risk, sufficient time to react
5: Negligible Risk - No significant risk
