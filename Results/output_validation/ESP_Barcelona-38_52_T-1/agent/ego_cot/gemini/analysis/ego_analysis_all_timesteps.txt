### Safety analysis for timestep 3.4s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

First, we need to acknowledge that the provided scenario lacks crucial information to accurately calculate TTC and MDC. We don't have ego vehicle dimensions, obstacle dimensions, or precise trajectory predictions.  We can only perform a qualitative analysis based on relative distances and velocities.  Furthermore, "adjusted distance" isn't defined; therefore, I'll use the given longitudinal and lateral distances. Also, diagonal distance between ego and obstacle is considered for MDC evaluation.



### Obstacle Analysis:

**- Obstacle ID: 30721**
- Distance Risk reason: Located 12.44m longitudinally and laterally in the front-left.  Poses no immediate threat.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason:  Moving slowly towards ego longitudinally, but the large distance suggests ample time to react.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

**- Obstacle ID: 30723**
- Distance Risk reason:  Very close at 1.96m longitudinally and laterally in the front-left. High risk of collision.
- Distance safety score: 2
- Time Risk reason:  Moving towards the ego longitudinally, increasing the risk.  Requires immediate attention.
- Time safety score: 2
- Overall Risk score: 2

**- Obstacle ID: 30724**
- Distance Risk reason: Located at 11.9m longitudinally and laterally in the front-left, relatively far.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Moving towards the ego both longitudinally and laterally. Monitor closely.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3

**- Obstacle ID: 30726**
- Distance Risk reason:  At 8.89m longitudinally and laterally front-right, presents a low risk currently.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Moving slightly towards the ego longitudinally but away laterally, mitigating the risk.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

**- Obstacle ID: 30732**
- Distance Risk reason: Very close at 2.23m longitudinally and laterally in the front-left. High risk.
- Distance safety score: 2
- Time Risk reason:  Moving towards the ego both longitudinally and laterally, increasing the risk substantially.
- Time safety score: 2
- Overall Risk score: 2

**- Obstacle ID: 30733**
- Distance Risk reason:  At 9.96m longitudinally and laterally in front, presenting minimal risk from distance.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Moving away longitudinally. The lateral movement towards the ego is not a concern given the longitudinal motion.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 4


**- Obstacle ID: 30734**
- Distance Risk reason: Located at 0m longitudinally and laterally to the right, implying a possible collision or very near miss if vehicle dimensions overlap.
- Distance safety score: 1
- Time Risk reason: Moving towards the ego laterally, worsening the situation. The longitudinal velocity suggests a possible lane change or similar maneuver.
- Time safety score: 1
- Overall Risk score: 1

**- Obstacle ID: 30736**
- Distance Risk reason: Located at 0m longitudinally and laterally to the right, implying a collision or very near miss if vehicle dimensions overlap.
- Distance safety score: 1
- Time Risk reason:  The lateral movement towards the ego increases the risk significantly. The longitudinal velocity suggests a possible lane change or similar maneuver, but this is dangerous given the proximity.
- Time safety score: 1
- Overall Risk score: 1

**- Obstacle ID: 30737**
- Distance Risk reason: At -14.39m longitudinally and laterally in the rear-right, poses no immediate risk.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Approaching longitudinally from behind. Requires monitoring but isn't an immediate threat.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3

**- Obstacle ID: 30738**
- Distance Risk reason: At -8.37m longitudinally and laterally to the rear-left.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: The motion indicates the obstacle is moving towards the ego from behind but away laterally to the left.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

**- Obstacle ID: 30739**
- Distance Risk reason: Extremely close at -0.7m longitudinally and laterally from behind. Very high collision risk.
- Distance safety score: 1
- Time Risk reason: Approaching quickly from behind, increasing the risk substantially.
- Time safety score: 1
- Overall Risk score: 1

**- Obstacle ID: 30740**
- Distance Risk reason: Located far behind at -24.18m longitudinally and laterally. No immediate risk.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: While approaching from behind, the large distance suggests ample time to react.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4


**- Obstacle ID: 30741**
- Distance Risk reason:  At -16.90m longitudinally and laterally behind the ego vehicle. No immediate risk.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason:  Approaching from behind, but poses no immediate threat due to distance.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3
