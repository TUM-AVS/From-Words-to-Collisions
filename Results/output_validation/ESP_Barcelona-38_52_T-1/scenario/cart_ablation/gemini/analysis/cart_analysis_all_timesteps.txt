At t=3.6s, Ego is located at (109.1268, 160.6308) in lanelet 3089.  Obstacle 30739 is in the same lanelet 450 as Ego was previously and is now approaching Ego's prior position at (106.9376, 157.6556). Given Ego's trajectory and change in orientation, a lane change is likely, which introduces risk with obstacle 30734 at (114.6929, 155.4753) and obstacle 30736 at (112.6244, 158.3298). Though these obstacles show a decreasing velocity, the rapid lane change maneuver by Ego combined with proximity raises concern. There is insufficient data to definitively determine collision for either obstacle, but an assessment of extreme risk is warranted for obstacle 30736 due to its closer lateral position to Ego after its lane change.
