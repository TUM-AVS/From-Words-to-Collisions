At t=3.6s, Ego (30730.0) is in lanelet 3089.0 at (110.1, 160.6) with velocity 1.87 m/s.  Let's analyze the closest obstacles:

* **Obstacle 30739.0:** Located in the same lanelet (450.0) as Ego was initially, and its trajectory shows it moving closer to Ego's predicted path.  At 3.6s, it's at (106.9, 157.7) with velocity 6.38 m/s. Given the proximity and closing velocities, this represents an extreme risk.

* **Obstacle 30736.0:** In lanelet 3091.0 at (112.6, 158.3) with velocity 7.64 m/s.  Close proximity and relatively high closing speed suggest a high risk.

* **Obstacle 30734.0:** In lanelet 3092.0 at (114.7, 155.5) with velocity 6.61 m/s. Its proximity makes it a high risk, even though it appears to be decelerating.

* **Obstacle 30737.0:** In lanelet 452.0 at (102.2, 143.0) with velocity 8.16 m/s. It appears to be moving towards Ego, but the lateral distance reduces the risk to medium.

* **Obstacle 30738.0:** In lanelet 449.0 at (99.6, 155.3) with velocity 9.1 m/s. While its speed is high, the current lateral distance makes it a medium risk.


Only Obstacle 30739.0 reaches the Extreme Risk level.  The others are high or medium risks, so they are not included in the JSON output.
