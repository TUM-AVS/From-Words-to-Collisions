### Safety Analysis for the Most Recent Timestep:

### Obstacle Analysis:

#### Obstacle ID: 30726
- **Distance Risk reason**: Positioned in a different lanelet (2996), consistently moving away from the ego vehicle in both longitudinal and lateral directions.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: High velocity and acceleration indicate a trajectory diverging from Ego. No intersecting path.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 30732
- **Distance Risk reason**: Positioned in a different lanelet (3534), remains stationary relative to Ego over the timesteps.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: Minimal velocity and acceleration, indicating a stationary position.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 30733
- **Distance Risk reason**: Positioned in a far lanelet (3088), moving away quickly due to high velocity.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: Rapid velocity and acceleration away from Ego, not on a collision path.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 30734
- **Distance Risk reason**: Lanelet gap (3092), mostly lateral position. Decreasing velocity indicates no path conflict.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: Deceleration and velocity decrease trend, diverging path.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 30736
- **Distance Risk reason**: Further lanelet (3091), trends of deceleration and turning away.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: Path suggests moving away. Stable decrease ensures no risk.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 30737
- **Distance Risk reason**: Positioned in lanelet 452, traveling outward.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: High velocity away from ego vehicle path.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 30738
- **Distance Risk reason**: Lanelet 449, motion indicates detachment from the ego's path in past timesteps.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: Velocity and acceleration indicate moving away.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 30739
- **Distance Risk reason**: In same lanelet (450), maintaining parallel course.
- **Distance safety score**: 4
- **Time Risk reason**: Slowed movement and steady trajectory.
- **Time safety score**: 4
- **Overall Risk score**: 4

#### Obstacle ID: 30741
- **Distance Risk reason**: Parallel path, but slightly orthogonal from Ego in lanelet 445.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: Velocity variation, yet trend shows outward movement.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
- This is not a collision scenario â€“ all obstacles, based on trajectory and current positions, either remain stationary or maintain a trajectory away from the ego vehicle. Analysis shows none are on an intersecting collision course based on velocity trends, position locational adjustments, and relative distance.
