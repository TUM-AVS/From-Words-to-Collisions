At t=3.6s, Obstacle 30739 is in direct collision with the ego vehicle, as indicated by a longitudinal and lateral distance of 0.0m.  Obstacle 30723 is also at the same longitudinal distance as the ego vehicle and could pose a collision risk in the immediate future if lateral movement is not sufficient. Obstacles 30724 and 30732 are also longitudinally very close to the ego vehicle but have some lateral distance, posing a high risk. Other obstacles are further away but approaching quickly from behind.
