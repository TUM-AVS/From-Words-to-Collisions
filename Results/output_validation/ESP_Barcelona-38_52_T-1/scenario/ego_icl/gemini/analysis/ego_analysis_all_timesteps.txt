* **Obstacle 30721**: Located Front-Left, moving slowly towards the ego vehicle longitudinally.  Lateral movement is negligible. The small decrease in longitudinal velocity suggests it might be braking slightly.  No immediate risk. Risk score: 5 (No Risk)

* **Obstacle 30723**: Located Front-Left, also moving slowly towards the ego vehicle longitudinally with negligible lateral movement. Similar to Obstacle 30721 but much closer longitudinally.  Requires monitoring. Risk score: 4 (Low Risk)

* **Obstacle 30724**: Front-Left, but far away with a moderately closing longitudinal velocity and a slow closing lateral velocity. No immediate risk. Risk score: 5 (No Risk)

* **Obstacle 30732**: Front-Left. Moderately closing longitudinal velocity, slow lateral closing velocity. No immediate risk. Risk score: 5 (No Risk)

* **Obstacle 30733**: Front-Left. Moving longitudinally away from the ego vehicle as confirmed by the positive relative longitudinal velocity. Therefore, no longitudinal risk. Lateral motion is slightly towards the ego vehicle but far away.  No immediate risk. Risk score: 5 (No Risk)

* **Obstacle 30734**: To the Right of the ego car. Exact longitudinal alignment at this timestep is indicated, meaning the cars have the same longitudinal positions. Although lateral motion is slightly towards the ego car, there is a lateral distance between the two cars. No immediate risk. Risk score: 4 (Low Risk)

* **Obstacle 30736**: To the Right of the ego car. Exact longitudinal alignment at this timestep is indicated. Lateral motion is slightly towards the ego car, but still at distance. Risk score: 4 (Low Risk)

* **Obstacle 30737**: Rear-Right, far behind and moving away. No risk. Risk score: 5 (No Risk)

* **Obstacle 30738**: Approaching from behind and slightly to the left. No risk. Risk score: 5 (No Risk)

* **Obstacle 30739**: Directly behind and approaching longitudinally, with exact lateral alignment. Trajectory analysis shows its longitudinal distance rapidly decreasing across timesteps, indicating a collision risk. Risk score: 0 (Collision)


* **Obstacle 30740**: Rear-Right, far behind and moving away. No risk. Risk score: 5 (No Risk)

* **Obstacle 30741**: Directly behind and approaching longitudinally, with exact lateral alignment. Trajectory analysis shows its longitudinal distance rapidly decreasing across timesteps. Risk score: 5 (No Risk)

**Collision Scenario Determination:** Yes, this is a collision scenario. Obstacle 30739 shows exact alignment and a near-zero distance with ego vehicle while rapidly approaching, therefore a collision is classified.
