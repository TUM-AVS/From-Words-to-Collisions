To properly assess the collision risk and identify if this is a collision scenario, let's analyze each obstacle at the most recent timestep (3.6 seconds) using the adjusted distances and considering their trajectories:

### Obstacle-by-Obstacle Analysis:

1. **Obstacle 30721 (Front-left)**
   - **Adjusted Distances:** Longitudinal = 6.55 m, Lateral = 16.68 m
   - **Relative Velocity:** Longitudinal = -1.87 m/s, Lateral = -0.00 m/s
   - **Trajectory:** Moving toward the ego car longitudinally; no lateral movement
   - **TTC Longitudinal:** 6.55 m / 1.87 m/s ≈ 3.50 seconds
   - **MDC Calculation:** Since lateral is stable and large, consider longitudinal primarily
   - **Risk Score:** Medium Risk (3) due to longitudinal TTC being around 3.0 seconds

2. **Obstacle 30723 (Left)**
   - **Adjusted Distances:** Longitudinal = 0 m, Lateral = 12.56 m
   - **Relative Velocity:** Longitudinal = -1.87 m/s, Lateral = -0.00 m/s
   - **Trajectory:** Exact longitudinal alignment; no lateral movement
   - **TTC Longitudinal:** Not applicable since they’re perfectly aligned, but no lateral velocity to cause collision
   - **MDC Calculation:** No approaching path; lateral distance is not closing
   - **Risk Score:** No Risk (5)

3. **Obstacle 30724 (Front-left)**
   - **Adjusted Distances:** Longitudinal = 3.17 m, Lateral = 24.61 m
   - **Relative Velocity:** Longitudinal = -1.46 m/s, Lateral = -0.98 m/s
   - **Trajectory:** Moving toward ego car longitudinally and laterally from the left
   - **TTC Longitudinal:** 3.17 m / 1.46 m/s ≈ 2.17 seconds
   - **MDC Calculation:** Continue monitoring; lateral distance large
   - **Risk Score:** Medium Risk (3) as longitudinal TTC is less than 3 seconds

4. **Obstacle 30732 (Left)**
   - **Adjusted Distances:** Longitudinal = 0 m, Lateral = 20.47 m
   - **Relative Velocity:** Longitudinal = -0.88 m/s, Lateral = -0.92 m/s
   - **Trajectory:** Exact longitudinal alignment, lateral approach
   - **TTC Lateral:** Not applicable as it's only slightly closing
   - **MDC Calculation:** No approaching path
   - **Risk Score:** No Risk (5)

5. **Obstacle 30733 (Front-left)**
   - **Adjusted Distances:** Longitudinal = 10.72 m, Lateral = 4.83 m
   - **Relative Velocity:** Longitudinal = 10.39 m/s, Lateral = 2.28 m/s
   - **Trajectory:** Moving away longitudinally and laterally
   - **TTC Calculation:** N/A (moving away)
   - **MDC Calculation:** Not closing in
   - **Risk Score:** No Risk (5)

6. **Obstacle 30734 (Right)**
   - **Adjusted Distances:** Longitudinal = 0 m, Lateral = -4.88 m
   - **Relative Velocity:** Longitudinal = 4.29 m/s, Lateral = 2.38 m/s
   - **Trajectory:** Exact longitudinal alignment; lateral movement
   - **TTC Calculation:** N/A (no closing path)
   - **MDC Calculation:** Not approaching effectively; lateral isn’t closing
   - **Risk Score:** No Risk (5)

7. **Obstacle 30736 (Right)**
   - **Adjusted Distances:** Longitudinal = 0 m, Lateral = -1.46 m
   - **Relative Velocity:** Longitudinal = 5.30 m/s, Lateral = 2.65 m/s
   - **Trajectory:** Exact longitudinal alignment; lateral path diverging
   - **TTC Calculation:** N/A
   - **MDC Calculation:** No convergence on path
   - **Risk Score:** No Risk (5)

8. **Obstacle 30737 (Rear-right)**
   - **Adjusted Distances:** Longitudinal = -9.44 m, Lateral = -11.74 m
   - **Relative Velocity:** Longitudinal = 5.64 m/s, Lateral = 3.18 m/s
   - **Trajectory:** From behind and moving laterally; diverging from rear-right
   - **TTC Calculation:** N/A
   - **MDC Calculation:** No immediate threat
   - **Risk Score:** No Risk (5)

9. **Obstacle 30738 (Behind)**
   - **Adjusted Distances:** Longitudinal = -7.22 m, Lateral = 0.00 m
   - **Relative Velocity:** Longitudinal = 6.50 m/s, Lateral = 3.55 m/s
   - **Trajectory:** Approaching from behind but lateral not decreasing.
   - **TTC Longitudinal:** (-7.22 m / 6.50 m/s) is negative, meaning passed, no closure.
   - **Risk Score:** No Risk (5)

10. **Obstacle 30739 (Collision of the ego car)**
    - **Adjusted Distances:** Longitudinal = 0.00 m, Lateral = 0.00 m
    - **Relative Velocity:** Longitudinal = 4.01 m/s, Lateral = 2.48 m/s
    - **Trajectory:** Appears to be proceeding away; still noted as exact alignment.
    - **TTC and MDC Calculation:** Distance exactly zero, indicating an existing collision!
    - **Risk Score:** Collision (0)

11. **Obstacle 30740 (Rear-right)**
    - **Adjusted Distances:** Longitudinal = -18.96 m, Lateral = -11.97 m
    - **Relative Velocity:** Longitudinal = 9.13 m/s, Lateral = 4.66 m/s
    - **Trajectory:** Approaching from behind but diverging laterally
    - **TTC Longitudinal:** N/A (no collision trajectory)
    - **Risk Score:** No Risk (5)

12. **Obstacle 30741 (Rear-right)**
    - **Adjusted Distances:** Longitudinal = -14.36 m, Lateral = -6.22 m
    - **Relative Velocity:** Longitudinal = 4.57 m/s, Lateral = 2.73 m/s
    - **Trajectory:** Moving toward ego car laterally from behind
    - **TTC Calculation:** N/A (not approaching closely)
    - **MDC Calculation:** No convergence on path
    - **Risk Score:** No Risk (5)

### Conclusion:

There is a confirmed immediate collision with **Obstacle 30739** as indicated by a longitudinal and lateral distance of zero and its trajectory suggests it might currently be overlapping with the ego vehicle. The presence of a collision risk score of 0 makes this a collision scenario.
