Here's the collision risk analysis:

**Analysis:**

The ego vehicle (ID 30819) is decelerating in lanelet 1959.  Several obstacles are present, but most are stationary or moving slowly and not in the ego vehicle's immediate path. Let's analyze the closest/most concerning obstacles:

* **Obstacle 30805:** Stationary in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle, but further down the road.  Poses a medium risk (3) due to its static position and the ego vehicle's deceleration.  A collision is possible if the ego vehicle continues decelerating aggressively.

* **Obstacle 30813:** Also in lanelet 1959 and moving very slowly.  This presents a low risk (4) as it is slightly further away than 30805, and also moving slowly.

* **Obstacle 30814:** Initially moving quickly towards the ego vehicle.  This represents the greatest risk. However, this obstacle is also decelerating rapidly, which mitigates the risk. Risk score initially is 2 (high risk) but with subsequent deceleration, it drops to 3.

* **Obstacle 30815:** Moving slowly and not directly in the ego vehicle's path. Low risk (4).
