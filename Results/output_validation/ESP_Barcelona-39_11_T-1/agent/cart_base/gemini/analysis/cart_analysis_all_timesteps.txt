Here's an analysis of the scenario and the resulting JSON:

**Analysis:**

* **Obstacle 30805:** Stationary in the same lane as the ego vehicle, but initially far enough away. However, the ego vehicle is decelerating, and its position relative to 30805 needs careful monitoring for potential future high risk if the ego's deceleration continues and it doesn't change lanes. *Risk Score: Initially 4 (Low Risk), potentially increasing to 2 (High Risk) or even 1 (Extreme Risk) in the near future.*

* **Obstacle 30807, 30808, 30814:** Located in adjacent lanes. 30814 initially has significant velocity, but is decelerating rapidly.  While not immediately risky, the ego vehicle's path might intersect with 30814 if both continue their current trajectories. The other two are static and not currently on a collision course.  *Risk Score: 4 (Low Risk), with 30814 requiring monitoring.*

* **Obstacles 30812, 30816, 30818, 30820, 30824, 30825, 30828:** These obstacles are stationary and located in different lanelets, posing no immediate threat. *Risk Score: 5 (Negligible Risk).*

* **Obstacle 30813:**  Located in the same lane as the ego vehicle but fairly close and moving slowly.  Its slow speed and the ego vehicle's deceleration warrants close observation. *Risk Score: 3 (Medium Risk).*

* **Obstacle 30815:**  Moving relatively slowly in an adjacent lane, and does not present an immediate collision risk. *Risk Score: 4 (Low Risk).*

* **Obstacle 30827:**  Moving in a different lanelet than the ego vehicle, which may represent crossing/merging lanes (given the different lanelet and y-position). This warrants monitoring, although there's no immediate danger. *Risk Score: 4 (Low Risk).*

* **Obstacle 30832:** Moving in a different lanelet and with different orientation than the ego vehicle.  This likely represents an intersection or merging situation.  Needs to be monitored due to changing acceleration. *Risk Score: 4 (Low Risk).*

Over the time observed, the ego vehicle continues decelerating.  The most important obstacles to monitor are 30805 and 30813 due to their proximity and being in the same lane as the ego vehicle. Although obstacle 30814 is decelerating significantly, it warrants continuous observation due to its higher initial speed and proximity.

**JSON Output:**
