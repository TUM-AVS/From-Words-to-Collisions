Obstacle 30813 is in the same lane as the ego vehicle and moving very slowly.  The risk is medium as the ego vehicle is decelerating, but monitoring is necessary.

Obstacle 30814 is ahead of the ego vehicle and decelerating rapidly, but the MDC is large.  The risk is low.

Obstacle 30815 is in a different lane and the ego vehicle is nearly parallel to it. The current MDC is moderate but there is no immediate risk.
