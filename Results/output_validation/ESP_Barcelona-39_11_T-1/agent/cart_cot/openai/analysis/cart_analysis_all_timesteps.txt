### Analysis

1. **Obstacle 30805.0**: It remains stationary in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle throughout the observed timesteps. Despite the proximity, the ego vehicle’s slow speed means there's potential maneuverability, but there is a significant risk due to no motion from the obstacle.

2. **Obstacle 30814.0**: This obstacle is of particular concern. It started with a higher velocity, which dramatically decreased over the subsequent timesteps, with it showing minimal velocity close to 9.0 seconds. This abrupt change in speed increases the risk of sudden collision, especially since it shares the neighborhood with the ego vehicle’s path.

Considering the trajectories and stagnation of some obstacles, particularly in lanelet 1959.0, the focus is mainly on 30805.0 and 30814.0 due to their positioning and velocity profiles.
