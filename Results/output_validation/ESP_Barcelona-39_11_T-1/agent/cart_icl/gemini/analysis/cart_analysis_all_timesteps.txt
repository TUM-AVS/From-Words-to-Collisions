Obstacle 30805 is stationary in the same lane as the ego vehicle, and the distance between them has remained constant over the past 10 timesteps.  While not an immediate threat, the obstacle's persistent presence in the ego vehicle's path represents a medium risk that requires monitoring and potential maneuvering.

Obstacle 30813 is also stationary in the ego vehicle's lane. The distance between the ego vehicle and this obstacle has remained relatively constant over the past 10 timesteps. Similar to Obstacle 30805, this poses a medium risk requiring continuous monitoring.

Obstacle 30814 is slowing down significantly in a lane to the right of the ego vehicle. Given its deceleration and the current trajectories, the risk of collision is low, but monitoring is still necessary.
