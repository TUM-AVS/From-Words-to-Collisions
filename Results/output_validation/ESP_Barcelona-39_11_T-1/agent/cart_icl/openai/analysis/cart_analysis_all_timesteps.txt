To assess the risk levels in this scenario, let's analyze the situation at the latest timestep, 9.0 seconds:

### Key Observations:

1. **Ego Vehicle (30819.0)**:
   - Current Position: (299.6337, -17.7167)
   - Velocity: 0.4837 m/s (slowing down)
   - Lanelet: 1959.0

2. **Obstacle 30805.0**:
   - Position: (308.3159, -26.5035)
   - Stationary
   - Same lanelet as Ego
   - Relative Position: Approximately 13.59 meters behind Ego.
   - Risk Level: 4 (Low Risk)

3. **Obstacle 30813.0**:
   - Position: (303.0404, -21.1643)
   - Very low velocity, similar lanelet as Ego
   - Relative Position: 3.77 meters behind and slightly laterally aligned.
   - Risk Level: 3 (Medium Risk)

4. **Obstacle 30814.0**:
   - Position: (315.618, -19.4305)
   - Stationary, very close to the Ego's lane
   - Relative Position: Ahead by about 16 meters, stationary.
   - Risk Level: 1 (Extreme Risk) due to the proximity, same path, and potential deceleration of Ego.

5. **Obstacle 30815.0**:
   - Position: (306.4381, -18.1667)
   - Moderate speed
   - Same direction with slight separation
   - Risk Level: 4 (Low Risk)

6. Other Obstacles:
   - Most other obstacles are either stationary or have negligible velocity, with significant lateral separation or in unrelated lanelets. The risks associated with these are low.

### Risk Analysis:

- **Obstacle 30814.0** presents the most significant risk due to its proximity in the path of the Ego vehicle and its stopped status at 9 seconds. This creates a potential "Extreme Risk" scenario because of the potential for an eventual collision if Ego does not adjust trajectory or velocity despite its deceleration.
- **Obstacle 30813.0**, being in the same lanelet and behind the Ego, requires attention though it poses a medium risk because its speed is negligible, maintaining some separation.

### JSON Output:

```json
{
    "CollisionObstacles": [],
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "30814.0",
        "OverallRiskScore": 1
    },
    "HighRiskObstacle": null
}
```

This output reflects the analysis showing that obstacle 30814.0 is the one with an `Extreme Risk` due to the spatial dynamics and the current state of movement.
