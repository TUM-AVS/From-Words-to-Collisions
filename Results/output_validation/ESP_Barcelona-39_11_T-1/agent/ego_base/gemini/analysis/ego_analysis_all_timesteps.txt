At t=9.0s, Obstacle 30813 is closest to the ego vehicle longitudinally (0.34m) and has a negative longitudinal relative velocity (-0.48 m/s), meaning it is moving towards the ego vehicle.  This represents a very high risk of collision. It is classified as extremely high risk due to its proximity and the closing velocity, giving minimal time to react.

Obstacle 30832 is also quite close longitudinally (1.32m) and laterally (-19.36m) to the ego vehicle and moving towards the ego vehicle longitudinally (-0.46m/s) and laterally (1.87m/s). However, its longitudinal distance is still larger than the extremely high-risk threshold. Therefore, it is considered high risk.

Other obstacles are farther away and do not pose an immediate threat. Specifically, obstacles 30805, 30807, 30808 are driving toward the ego car but are still relatively far. Obstacles 30812, 30816, 30818, 30820, 30824, 30825, and 30828 are moving away from the ego and are therefore not a risk. Obstacle 30814 is driving towards the ego car, but its longitudinal distance is greater than that of obstacle 30832. Obstacle 30815 is moving away from the ego car longitudinally. Finally, obstacle 30827 is moving away longitudinally and approaching laterally, but its distance is substantial.

Risk Levels:
0: Collision - Physical contact occurred or unavoidable
1: Extreme Risk - Immediate collision likely
2: High Risk - Close to collision, needs quick action
3: Medium Risk - Manageable with proper reaction
4: Low Risk - Minimal risk, sufficient time to react
5: Negligible Risk - No significant risk
