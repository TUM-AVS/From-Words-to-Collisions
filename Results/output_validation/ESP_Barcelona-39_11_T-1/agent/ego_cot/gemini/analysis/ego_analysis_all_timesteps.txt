### Safety analysis for timestep 9.0s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

First, let's clarify the use of "adjusted distances."  Since no specific ego vehicle or obstacle dimensions are provided, I will assume the provided longitudinal and lateral distances already incorporate necessary adjustments for vehicle size.  If you have access to vehicle dimensions, you should subtract the appropriate radii or safety margins from the given distances to get the true minimum distances.

Additionally, I will make the following assumptions about calculating TTC based on the provided information: 
* The negative sign of relative velocities towards the ego car suggests the ego vehicle is the reference point.
* Therefore TTC values should be positive since the obstacles are approaching.

Based on the scenario context, we also make these assumptions:
* In the current timestamp, Obstacle 30813 is the closest longitudinal obstacle.
* In the current timestamp, Obstacle 30832 is the second closest longitudinal obstacle.
* In the current timestamp, Obstacle 30815 is the third closest longitudinal obstacle.

#### Obstacle Analysis:

**Note:**  Lateral movement and distances are considered, but prioritized less than longitudinal distances for collision risk, assuming a typical road scenario.  If the scenario involved highly lateral movements (e.g., intersection crossing), this prioritization would need to be adjusted.

- **Obstacle ID: 30812**
    - Distance Risk reason: Far behind.
    - Distance safety score: 5
    - Time Risk reason: Moving away.
    - Time safety score: 5
    - Overall Risk score: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 30813**
    - Distance Risk reason: Very close in front. High risk of collision
    - Distance safety score: 1
    - Time Risk reason: Approaching quickly, very high risk. The speed is around 0.48m/s. So the TTC is 0.34/0.48= 0.7s <1

    - Time safety score: 5
    - Overall Risk score: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 30815**
    - Distance Risk reason: Close in front-left. The Distance of 0.61m indicates a potential hazard and requires close monitoring.
    - Distance safety score: 2
    - Time Risk reason: Moving away longitudinally, though lateral movement is towards ego vehicle. Low TTC.
    - Time safety score: 5
    - Overall Risk score: 2

- **Obstacle ID: 30816**
    - Distance Risk reason: Far behind.
    - Distance safety score: 5

    - Time safety score: 5
    - Overall Risk score: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 30825**
    - Distance Risk reason: Far behind.
    - Distance safety score: 5
    - Time Risk reason: Moving away.
    - Time safety score: 5
    - Overall Risk score: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 30827**
    - Distance Risk reason: Moderately far in front-right.
    - Distance safety score: 4
    - Time Risk reason: Moving away longitudinally but lateral movement needs monitoring.
    - Time safety score: 5
    - Overall Risk score: 4


- **Obstacle ID: 30828**
    - Distance Risk reason: Far behind.
    - Distance safety score: 5
    - Time Risk reason: Moving away.
    - Time safety score: 5
    - Overall Risk score: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 30832**
    - Distance Risk reason: Close in front-right. The Distance of 1.32m indicates a potential hazard and requires close monitoring.
    - Distance safety score: 3
    - Time Risk reason: Approaching quickly, high risk.  Lateral movement adds to risk. The relative velocity is -0.46, and distance is 1.32m. So TTC is 1.32/0.46 = 2.8s
    - Time safety score: 3
    - Overall Risk score: 3
