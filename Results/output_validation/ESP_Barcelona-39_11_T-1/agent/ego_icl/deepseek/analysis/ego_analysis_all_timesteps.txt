Let me analyze the most recent timestep (9.0 seconds) for collision risks:

1. Obstacle 30805 (Front):
   - Longitudinal: 7.84m (closing at 0.48m/s)
   - Lateral: 0.00m (aligned)
   - TTC: 7.84/0.48 = 16.33s (No Risk)
   - MDC: 7.84m (No Risk)

2. Obstacle 30807 (Front-left):
   - Longitudinal: 7.88m (closing at 0.48m/s)
   - Lateral: 1.86m (stable)
   - TTC: N/A (lateral stable)
   - MDC: 1.86m (Medium Risk)

3. Obstacle 30808 (Front-left):
   - Longitudinal: 7.91m (closing at 0.48m/s)
   - Lateral: 5.36m (stable)
   - MDC: 5.36m (Low Risk)

4. Obstacle 30812 (Rear-left):
   - Moving away in both dimensions
   - No Risk

5. Obstacle 30813 (Front):
   - Longitudinal: 0.34m (closing at 0.48m/s)
   - Lateral: 0.00m (aligned)
   - TTC: 0.34/0.48 = 0.71s (High Risk)
   - MDC: 0.34m (Extreme Risk)
   - This is the most critical obstacle - rapidly approaching head-on

6. Obstacle 30814 (Front-left):
   - Longitudinal: 7.97m (closing at 0.48m/s)
   - Lateral: 8.53m (stable)
   - No Risk

7. Obstacle 30815 (Front-left):
   - Longitudinal: 0.61m (moving away at 0.24m/s)
   - Lateral: 2.90m (moving away at 0.35m/s)
   - Diverging paths - No Risk

8. Obstacle 30816 (Rear-left):
   - Moving away longitudinally
   - No Risk

9. Obstacle 30818 (Rear-left):
   - Moving away in both dimensions
   - No Risk

10. Obstacle 30820 (Rear-left):
    - Moving away in both dimensions
    - No Risk

11. Obstacle 30824 (Rear-left):
    - Moving away longitudinally
    - No Risk

12. Obstacle 30825 (Rear-left):
    - Moving away longitudinally
    - No Risk

13. Obstacle 30827 (Front-right):
    - Longitudinal: 4.98m (moving away at 0.88m/s)
    - Lateral: 10.32m (closing at 1.47m/s)
    - TTC: 10.32/1.47 = 7.02s (No Risk)
    - MDC: 4.98m (Low Risk)

14. Obstacle 30828 (Behind):
    - Moving away longitudinally
    - No Risk

15. Obstacle 30832 (Front-right):
    - Longitudinal: 1.32m (closing at 0.46m/s)
    - Lateral: 19.36m (closing at 1.87m/s)
    - TTC (long): 1.32/0.46 = 2.87s (Medium Risk)
    - TTC (lat): 19.36/1.87 = 10.35s (No Risk)
    - MDC: 1.32m (Medium Risk)

Critical Findings:
- Obstacle 30813 is at Extreme Risk (0.34m front distance, closing at 0.48m/s)
- Obstacle 30815 was concerning but is now moving away
- Obstacle 30832 shows Medium Risk but not immediate danger
