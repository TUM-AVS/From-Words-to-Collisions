At t=9.0s:

* **Obstacle 30805:** Front, longitudinal 7.84m, lateral 0.00m.  Relative longitudinal velocity -0.48 m/s. The obstacle is approaching longitudinally, but slowly. Lateral alignment suggests it's in the same lane. Given the slow closing speed, TTC is 7.84/0.48 = 16.33s.  MDC is high due to lateral alignment but longitudinal distance is significant. Risk: Negligible (5).

* **Obstacle 30807:** Front-left, longitudinal 7.88m, lateral 1.86m. Relative longitudinal velocity -0.48 m/s, no lateral relative velocity.  Approaching slowly longitudinally. Lateral distance is stable.  TTC longitudinally is large. Risk: Negligible (5).

* **Obstacle 30808:** Front-left, longitudinal 7.91m, lateral 5.36m. Similar to 30807, approaching slowly longitudinally with a stable and greater lateral distance. Risk: Negligible (5).

* **Obstacle 30812:** Rear-left, longitudinal -13.17m, lateral 8.73m. Moving away and poses no risk. Risk: Negligible (5).

* **Obstacle 30813:** Front, longitudinal 0.34m, lateral 0.00m. Relative longitudinal velocity -0.48m/s.  Although the longitudinal distance is small and the lateral distance is exactly aligned, the longitudinal relative velocity indicates that the obstacle is moving away from the ego vehicle. This possibly indicate sensor noise or an obstacle just passed. Since relative velocity is negative, the TTC calculation isn't applicable. With such a low MDC, Risk: Extreme Risk (1).

* **Obstacle 30814:** Front-left, longitudinal 7.97m, lateral 8.53m. Moving away. Risk: Negligible (5).

* **Obstacle 30815:** Front-left, longitudinal 0.61m, lateral 2.90m. Moving away longitudinally (0.24m/s) and laterally. This obstacle has likely just passed.  No collision risk. Risk: Medium (3).

* **Obstacle 30816:** Rear-left, longitudinal -20.67m, lateral 8.73m. Moving away. No risk. Risk: Negligible (5).

* **Obstacle 30818:** Rear-left, longitudinal -12.99m, lateral 1.73m. Moving away. No risk. Risk: Negligible (5).

* **Obstacle 30820:** Rear-left, longitudinal -13.07m, lateral 5.23m. Moving away. No risk. Risk: Negligible (5).

* **Obstacle 30824:** Rear-left, longitudinal -20.49m, lateral 1.73m. Moving away. No risk. Risk: Negligible (5).

* **Obstacle 30825:** Rear-left, longitudinal -20.57m, lateral 5.23m. Moving away. No risk. Risk: Negligible (5).

* **Obstacle 30827:** Front-right, longitudinal 4.98m, lateral -10.32m. Moving away longitudinally. Lateral velocity is towards the ego vehicle (1.47m/s), but the lateral distance is relatively large. No immediate risk. Risk: Low (4).

* **Obstacle 30828:** Behind, longitudinal -20.41m, lateral 0.00m. Moving away. No risk. Risk: Negligible (5).

* **Obstacle 30832:** Front-right, longitudinal 1.32m, lateral -19.36m. Approaching longitudinally (-0.46 m/s) and laterally (1.87m/s). Longitudinal TTC is 1.32 / 0.46 = 2.87s (Medium Risk). However, the lateral distance is quite large and poses no immediate threat.  MDC is determined primarily by the longitudinal distance. Risk: Medium (3).
