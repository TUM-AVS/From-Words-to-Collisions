### Analysis of the Most Recent Timestep (9.0 seconds)

#### Obstacle 30805
- **Position and Motion:** Located in the front of the ego car with adjusted longitudinal alignment of 7.84 m and lateral alignment of 0.00 m. Moving towards the ego car per motion description.
- **Trajectory:** Continues closing in the longitudinal direction.
- **TTC Calculation:** 
  - Longitudinal: \( \frac{7.84}{0.48} \approx 16.33 \) seconds
- **MDC Calculation:** Primary concern is longitudinal; current gap is 7.84 m.
- **Risk Assessment:** Negligible risk (5), as both TTC and MDC indicate ample distance.

#### Obstacle 30807
- **Position and Motion:** Front-left with 7.88 m longitudinal and 1.86 m lateral. Closing in longitudinal direction.
- **Trajectory:** Continues to approach along the diagonal.
- **TTC Calculation:** 
  - Longitudinal: \( \frac{7.88}{0.48} \approx 16.42 \) seconds
  
- **MDC Calculation:** Diagonal distance is approximately 8.10 m (Pythagorean theorem).
- **Risk Assessment:** Negligible risk (5), based on distance and slow closure.

#### Obstacle 30813
- **Position and Motion:** Directly in front; alignment is 0.34 m longitudinal and 0.00 m lateral. Described as closing in.
- **Trajectory:** Trajectory history shows continuous closure.
- **TTC Calculation:**
  - Longitudinal: \( \frac{0.34}{0.48} \approx 0.71 \) seconds

- **MDC Calculation:** Directly in front and nearly aligned in the lane.
- **Risk Assessment:** Extreme Risk (1), due to very short longitudinal distance and imminent collision risk.

#### Obstacle 30815
- **Position and Motion:** Front-left diagonal with 0.61 m longitudinal and 2.90 m lateral. Moving slightly away longitudinally based on motion description.
- **Trajectory:** Slight divergence observed in the last recordings.
- **TTC Calculation:** 
  - Longitudinal motion is away, not applicable for collision.
  
- **MDC Calculation:** Diagonal approach; still closing laterally with considerable distance in the lateral direction.
- **Risk Assessment:** High Risk (2), as close proximity still presents a concern for misinterpretation of trajectory.

### Conclusion
Each obstacle was examined primarily on the most recent timestep, emphasized by their predicted paths based on velocity and proximity considerations. Obstacle 30813 represents an extreme collision risk due to its proximity and closing velocity. 

It's critical to continuously monitor these obstacles, especially 30813, for any change in trajectory that might provide an opportunity to avoid collision.
