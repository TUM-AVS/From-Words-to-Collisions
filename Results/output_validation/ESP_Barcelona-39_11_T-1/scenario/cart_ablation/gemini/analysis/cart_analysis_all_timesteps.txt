At t=9.2s, the ego vehicle at (299.7017, -17.7851) is decelerating within lanelet 1959.  Several obstacles are present, but only those in the ego's lanelet (1959) pose an immediate threat. Obstacle 30805 at (308.3159, -26.5035) is stationary and relatively far, representing minimal risk. However, obstacle 30813, also in lanelet 1959, is at (303.0412, -21.1651) and moving slowly. Given the ego's position, velocity, and deceleration, and the close proximity of obstacle 30813 in the same lane, an extreme risk of collision exists. No obstacle appears to have actually collided yet.
