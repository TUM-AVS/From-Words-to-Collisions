At t=9.2s, the ego vehicle (30819.0) is at (299.7017, -17.7851) in lanelet 1959.0 with decreasing velocity (0.3633 m/s) and negative acceleration.  Let's analyze the closest obstacles in the same or adjacent lanelets:

* **Obstacle 30805.0:** Located at (308.3159, -26.5035) in lanelet 1959.0.  Static. While in the same lanelet, it's sufficiently far behind the ego vehicle and poses no immediate risk given the ego's deceleration. Risk 4/5.
* **Obstacle 30813.0:** Located at (303.0412, -21.1651) in lanelet 1959.0.  Almost stationary.  This obstacle is ahead of the ego vehicle in the same lanelet, but the longitudinal distance and ego vehicle's deceleration suggest no immediate collision risk. Risk 3/4.
* **Obstacle 30815.0:** Located at (306.5238, -18.1924) in lanelet 1958.0. Moving with increasing velocity (1.0011 m/s) and positive acceleration (0.7916 m/sÂ²).  This obstacle is in the adjacent lanelet and moving with an increasing velocity, requiring attention, however the lateral distance appears to be relatively safe at the moment and the obstacle is a short distance ahead. Risk 3/4.
* Obstacle 30814.0 is static and far enough away in a different lane. The other obstacles are also far enough to be low risk, in different lanelets, or decelerating.
