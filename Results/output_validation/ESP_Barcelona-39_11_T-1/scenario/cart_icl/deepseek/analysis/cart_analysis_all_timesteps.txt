### Safety Analysis for the Most Recent Timestep (9.2 seconds):

#### Key Observations:
1. **Ego Vehicle**: 
   - Position: (299.7017, -17.7851)
   - Orientation: -0.79006 rad (~-45.3Â°)
   - Velocity: 0.3633 m/s (decelerating)
   - Lanelet: 1959.0

2. **Obstacle Analysis**:
   - Most obstacles are either stationary or moving away from the ego vehicle's path.
   - Only a few obstacles are in the same lanelet (1959.0) or adjacent lanelets with potential interaction.

### Detailed Obstacle Analysis:

#### Obstacle 30805.0 (Same Lanelet 1959.0)
- **Current Position**: (308.3159, -26.5035)
- **Behavior**: Stationary (velocity=0, acceleration=0)
- **Distance**: ~9.0m (longitudinal), ~8.7m (lateral)
- **Risk**: Low (moving away, stationary)
- **Overall Risk Score**: 4

#### Obstacle 30813.0 (Same Lanelet 1959.0)
- **Current Position**: (303.0412, -21.1651)
- **Behavior**: Very slow movement (velocity=0.0054 m/s)
- **Distance**: ~3.4m (longitudinal), ~3.4m (lateral)
- **Risk**: Low (negligible velocity)
- **Overall Risk Score**: 4

#### Obstacle 30827.0 (Lanelet 4291.0)
- **Current Position**: (298.2484, -32.8446)
- **Behavior**: Moving at 2.0109 m/s (decelerating)
- **Distance**: ~1.5m (longitudinal), ~15.1m (lateral)
- **Risk**: Medium (approaching but lateral distance is large)
- **Overall Risk Score**: 3

#### Obstacle 30821.0 (Lanelet 936.0)
- **Current Position**: (278.2891, -47.3546)
- **Behavior**: Moving at 1.5142 m/s (decelerating)
- **Distance**: ~21.4m (longitudinal), ~29.6m (lateral)
- **Risk**: Negligible (moving away)
- **Overall Risk Score**: 5

#### Other Obstacles:
- All other obstacles are either stationary or moving away with no significant risk (scores 4-5).

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. **Collision Check**: No obstacles are in immediate collision path or overlapping with the ego vehicle.
2. **Trajectory Analysis**: No obstacles show a converging trajectory over the last 10 timesteps.
3. **Velocity/Acceleration**: Ego is decelerating, and no obstacles are accelerating towards it.
4. **Conclusion**: No collision or extreme risk scenarios detected.
