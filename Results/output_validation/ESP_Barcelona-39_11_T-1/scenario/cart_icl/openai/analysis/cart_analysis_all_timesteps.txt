  - Time safety score: 5
  - Overall Risk score: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 30827.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: Not on a collision course, positioned laterally far from the ego vehicle.
  - Distance safety score: 5
  - Time Risk reason: Maintaining consistent velocity at a safe distance.
  - Time safety score: 5
  - Overall Risk score: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 30832.0**
  - Distance Risk reason: Beyond immediate threat range, not directly in ego's path.
  - Distance safety score: 5
  - Time Risk reason: Moving laterally without proximity threat.
  - Time safety score: 5
  - Overall Risk score: 5

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
The scenario at the most recent timestep shows the ego vehicle slowing down with minimal velocity. The surrounding obstacles have either remained stationary or moved steadily away from the ego vehicle. There are no dynamic obstacles directly on a collision path with the ego vehicle within the evaluated positions and velocities.
