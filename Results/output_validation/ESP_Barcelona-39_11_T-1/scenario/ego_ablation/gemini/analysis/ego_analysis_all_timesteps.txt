Obstacle 30813 is at high risk of collision with the ego vehicle. It is located directly in front of the ego vehicle at a longitudinal distance of 0.24 meters, closing at a relative velocity of -0.36 m/s. Although there is some relative positive longitudinal acceleration, the proximity and closing velocity raise serious concerns.  An immediate reaction is needed to avoid collision.

Obstacle 30815 also presents a high risk.  While it is to the front-left of the ego (0.58 m longitudinal, 2.95 m lateral), it is still very close. The positive relative longitudinal velocity (0.51 m/s) indicates it may be moving away, but its proximity requires close monitoring.

    "Reasoning": "Obstacle 30813 is extremely close (0.24m) to the ego vehicle and approaching with a relative longitudinal velocity of -0.36 m/s. Despite positive acceleration, a collision is highly likely without immediate intervention. Obstacle 30815 is also at high risk due to its proximity."
