Obstacle 30813 is in the Front of the ego car with a longitudinal distance of 0.24 meters and approaching the ego car at -0.36 m/s. This obstacle presents a high risk of collision.

Obstacle 30815 is located Front-left with a longitudinal distance of 0.58 meters, and a lateral distance of 2.95 meters, and is moving away longitudinally at 0.51 m/s and laterally at 0.49 m/s.  While moving away longitudinally, the short distance warrants attention and classifies it as a high-risk obstacle.

Obstacle 30832, located Front-right, has a longitudinal distance of 1.25 meters and lateral distance of -18.98 meters and is approaching longitudinally at -0.33 m/s, while approaching laterally at 1.85 m/s. The relatively small longitudinal distance makes it a high-risk obstacle.
