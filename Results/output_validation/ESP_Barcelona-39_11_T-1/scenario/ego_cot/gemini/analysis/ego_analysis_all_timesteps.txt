### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
  "CollisionObstacle": null,
  "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {
    "ObstacleID": "30813",
    "OverallRiskScore": "1"
  },
  "IsCollisionScenario": false,
  "Justification": "Obstacle 30813 poses an extreme risk with a very short distance and TTC, indicating a likely collision if no action is taken. Other obstacles are either further away or moving in a less dangerous manner."
}
```

...(Repeat this analysis structure for each timestep: 8.4s, 8.5s, 8.6s, 8.7s, 8.8s, 8.9s, 9.0s, 9.1s, and 9.2s)...  Remember to update the JSON summary for each timestep reflecting the most immediate risks.  Pay very close attention to Obstacle 30813 which is closing rapidly.  If the longitudinal distance reaches 0, that indicates a collision and the `IsCollisionScenario` should be set to `true`.

```
Note: Because precise TTC calculations are impossible without a full kinematic model of the environment and are also computationally complex, the above analysis uses simplified estimates derived directly from the changes in relative distances and velocities.
