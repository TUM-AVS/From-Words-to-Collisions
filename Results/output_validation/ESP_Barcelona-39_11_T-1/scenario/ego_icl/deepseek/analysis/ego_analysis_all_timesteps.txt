Let me analyze the most recent timestep (9.2 seconds) for collision risks:

1. Obstacle 30805 (Front):
   - Longitudinal: 7.75m (closing at -0.36m/s)
   - Lateral: 0.00m (aligned)
   - TTC: 7.75/0.36 = 21.53s (No Risk)
   - MDC: 7.75m (No Risk)

2. Obstacle 30807 (Front-left):
   - Longitudinal: 7.78m (closing at -0.36m/s)
   - Lateral: 1.87m (stable)
   - TTC: N/A (lateral stable)
   - MDC: min(7.78,1.87) = 1.87m (Medium Risk)

3. Obstacle 30808 (Front-left):
   - Longitudinal: 7.81m (closing at -0.36m/s)
   - Lateral: 5.37m (stable)
   - TTC: N/A
   - MDC: 5.37m (Low Risk)

4. Obstacle 30812 (Rear-left):
   - Moving away longitudinally (-13.28m)
   - No collision risk

5. Obstacle 30813 (Front):
   - CRITICAL OBSERVATION:
     - Longitudinal: 0.24m (closing at -0.36m/s)
     - Lateral: 0.00m (perfect alignment)
     - TTC: 0.24/0.36 = 0.67s (High Risk)
     - MDC: 0.24m (Extreme Risk)
     - Trajectory shows consistent closing from 0.94m at 8.3s to 0.24m at 9.2s
     - Overall Risk: 1 (Extreme Risk)

6. Obstacle 30814 (Front-left):
   - Moving away longitudinally (7.86m)
   - No collision risk

7. Obstacle 30815 (Front-left):
   - Moving away in both dimensions
   - No risk

8. Obstacle 30816 (Rear-left):
   - Moving away longitudinally
   - No risk

9. Obstacle 30818 (Rear-left):
   - Moving away
   - No risk

10. Obstacle 30820 (Rear-left):
    - Moving away
    - No risk

11. Obstacle 30824 (Rear-left):
    - Moving away
    - No risk

12. Obstacle 30825 (Rear-left):
    - Moving away
    - No risk

13. Obstacle 30827 (Front-right):
    - Moving away longitudinally
    - No risk

14. Obstacle 30828 (Behind):
    - Moving away
    - No risk

15. Obstacle 30832 (Front-right):
    - Longitudinal: 1.25m (closing at -0.33m/s)
    - Lateral: -18.98m (closing at 1.85m/s)
    - TTC (lateral): 18.98/1.85 = 10.26s
    - MDC: min(1.25,18.98) = 1.25m (Medium Risk)

Critical Findings:
- Obstacle 30813 poses Extreme Risk (Risk 1) with:
  - MDC = 0.24m (Extreme Risk range)
  - TTC = 0.67s (High Risk range)
  - Perfect lateral alignment
  - Consistent closing trajectory

This qualifies as a collision scenario due to the extreme risk posed by Obstacle 30813.

```json
{
    "CollisionObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "None",
        "OverallRiskScore": "0"
    },
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "30813",
        "OverallRiskScore": "1"
    },
    "IsCollisionScenario": true,
    "Justification": "Obstacle 30813 is directly ahead with only 0.24m longitudinal distance (perfect lateral alignment) and closing at 0.36m/s, resulting in Extreme Risk (MDC=0.24m, TTC=0.67s)"
}
