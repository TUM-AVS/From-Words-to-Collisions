Here's the collision risk analysis:

**Obstacle 30805:** This obstacle remains stationary throughout the scenario and is positioned laterally away from the ego vehicle's trajectory.  It poses no collision risk. *Risk Score: 5*

**Obstacle 30807:** This obstacle is moving slowly and is also laterally separated from the ego vehicle's path. There is no immediate risk. *Risk Score: 5*

**Obstacle 30808:** This obstacle is stationary and located somewhat close to the ego vehicle's path. However, given the ego vehicle's trajectory and the lateral separation, a collision is unlikely. *Risk Score: 4*

**Obstacle 30810:** This obstacle initially has some velocity but decelerates rapidly and comes to a stop. While its y-coordinate is relatively close to the ego vehicle's, the x-coordinate difference and the ego vehicle's continued motion suggest no imminent collision risk. *Risk Score: 4*

**Predicted Collision:** By extrapolating the ego vehicle's motion and considering its deceleration, there's a possibility of the ego vehicle encroaching upon obstacle 30808's x-coordinate within the next couple of seconds if the deceleration continues. Therefore, there is a predicted increased risk with obstacle 30808.
