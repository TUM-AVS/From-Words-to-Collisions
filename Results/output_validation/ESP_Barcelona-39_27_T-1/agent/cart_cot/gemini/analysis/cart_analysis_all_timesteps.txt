At t=3.2s, the ego vehicle is at (290.4167, 6.2404) with a velocity of 7.2271 and decelerating at -5.0804.  Obstacle 30808 is stationary at (289.6823, -2.9459), posing the most immediate risk due to its proximity and the ego vehicle's trajectory. Although the ego vehicle is decelerating significantly, the y-coordinate difference suggests a likely collision if the deceleration is not sufficient or if the ego vehicle's heading changes towards the obstacle.

Obstacle 30807 continues to be a low risk, moving slowly and away from the ego vehicle's path. Obstacle 30805 remains stationary and far from the ego vehicle's trajectory. Obstacle 30810 is also stationary and poses no immediate risk.
