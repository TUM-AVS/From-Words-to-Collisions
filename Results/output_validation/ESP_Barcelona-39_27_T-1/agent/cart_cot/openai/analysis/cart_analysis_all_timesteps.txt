At 3.2 seconds, let's evaluate each obstacle in relation to the Ego vehicle. We'll determine the risk levels based on their relative positions, velocities, and our understanding of motion trends from previous timesteps.

### Analysis:

1. **Obstacle 30805.0:**  
   - **Position:** (287.2637, -5.4749)
   - **Velocity:** 0.0 m/s
   - **Trajectory:** Static, not moving from its position across all timesteps.
   - **Risk Assessment:** Though the obstacle is static, it is very close to the Ego's predicted path, and over the course of the last few timesteps, the Ego moved into a closely surrounding lane. Given its proximity, it presents a high immediate risk requiring urgent action to prevent collision.

2. **Obstacle 30807.0:**  
   - **Position:** (281.9573, -0.1357)
   - **Velocity:** Very slow, with marginal negative acceleration.
   - **Trajectory:** Slowly moving away from its initial position linearly, not in direct path or causing immediate collision risk.
   - **Risk Assessment:** Low to negligible risk due to its position and velocity.

3. **Obstacle 30808.0:**  
   - **Position:** (289.6823, -2.9459)
   - **Velocity:** 0.0 m/s
   - **Trajectory:** Static.
   - **Risk Assessment:** Not directly on the Ego's path due to its lateral distance. Negligible risk.

4. **Obstacle 30810.0:**  
   - **Position:** (294.5163, 2.1166)
   - **Velocity:** Static in recent times.
   - **Trajectory:** After initially having some velocity trails, it is positioned well away from the Ego. Negligible risk.

Given the careful consideration of the proximity and trajectory of the Ego vehicle, **Obstacle 30805.0** presents the most significant risk due to its static position near the Ego's path, despite not moving. Immediate corrective action needed to ensure safety.
