At t=3.2s, the ego vehicle is decelerating heavily (-5.08 m/sÂ²) and has changed lanes. Obstacle 30808 is the most concerning, being relatively close laterally (-2.9459m) and in a similar longitudinal position (289.6823m vs 290.4167m for ego), although it appears stationary. Obstacle 30807 is further away laterally and moving slowly. Obstacles 30805 and 30810 are not a concern.  Obstacle 30808 represents a high risk due to its proximity and the ego vehicle's deceleration.
