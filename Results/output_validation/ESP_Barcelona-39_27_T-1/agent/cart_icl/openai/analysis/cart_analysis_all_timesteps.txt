To evaluate the given scenario, we'll first analyze each obstacle regarding their motion and proximity to the Ego vehicle, taking the most recent timestep at 3.2 seconds into focus.

### Analysis:

1. **Ego Vehicle (30809.0)**:
   - Current position: (290.4167, 6.2404)
   - Current velocity: 7.2271 m/s
   - Acceleration: -5.0804 m/sÂ²

2. **Obstacle 30805.0**:
   - Position: (287.2637, -5.4749)
   - Velocity: 0.0 m/s
   - Not moving and located in a different lanelet. The lateral distance is substantial, indicating no immediate risk.

3. **Obstacle 30807.0**:
   - Position: (281.9573, -0.1357)
   - Velocity: 0.0231 m/s
   - This obstacle poses negligible risk as it is traveling very slowly and stays in a different lanelet.

4. **Obstacle 30808.0**:
   - Position: (289.6823, -2.9459)
   - Velocity: 0.0 m/s
   - Stationary; its lateral and longitudinal distance from the Ego vehicle is significant to present no immediate risk.

5. **Obstacle 30810.0**:
   - Position: (294.5163, 2.1166)
   - Velocity: 0.0 m/s
   - Stationary; positioned sufficiently away, and, in another lanelet, no immediate risk.

### Summary:
- There was no critical risk detected in terms of potential collision candidates.
- Lateral separations are all significant enough to disregard lateral collision threats.
- All obstacles show either stationary behavior or substantial separation in terms of lateral movement from the Ego vehicle.

### JSON Output:

```json
{
    "CollisionObstacles": [],
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {},
    "HighRiskObstacle": {}
}
```

No obstacles present a Collision Risk (0) or Extreme Risk (1). The analysis shows no significant threat of collision in the scenario.
