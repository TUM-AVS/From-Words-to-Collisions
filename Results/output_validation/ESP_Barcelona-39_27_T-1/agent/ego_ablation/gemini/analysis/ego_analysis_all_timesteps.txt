At t=3.2s, multiple obstacles pose a significant risk to the ego vehicle.

* **Obstacle 30805:** Located 1.64m longitudinally and -8.85m laterally (front-right), this obstacle is approaching the ego vehicle at -7.23 m/s longitudinally.  Given the short distance and closing velocity, a collision is imminent if the trajectories remain unchanged.  Scores: Proximity (1), MDC (1), TTC (1), Overall Risk (1).

* **Obstacle 30807:** Situated directly to the right of the ego vehicle (0.0m longitudinally, -8.89m laterally), this obstacle represents a potential collision hazard due to its lateral position and the possibility of the ego vehicle making a right turn. The longitudinal velocity is -7.20 m/s.  Scores: Proximity (1), MDC (1), TTC (1), Overall Risk (1).

* **Obstacle 30808:**  At 1.53m longitudinally and -5.35m laterally (front-right), this obstacle also presents an extreme risk.  With a closing velocity of -7.23 m/s longitudinally, a collision is likely without intervention. Scores: Proximity (1), MDC (1), TTC (1), Overall Risk (1).

* **Obstacle 30810:** Positioned directly in front of the ego vehicle (1.31m longitudinally, 0.0m laterally) and approaching at -7.23 m/s, this obstacle poses the most immediate collision risk. Scores: Proximity (1), MDC (1), TTC (1), Overall Risk (1).

Given that all obstacles have a Risk Score of 1, and only one ExtremeRiskObstacle can be placed in the JSON. Obstacle 30810 is the most critical as it's directly ahead and requires urgent evasive action. Others also hold a Risk Score of 1 and could be placed as well.
