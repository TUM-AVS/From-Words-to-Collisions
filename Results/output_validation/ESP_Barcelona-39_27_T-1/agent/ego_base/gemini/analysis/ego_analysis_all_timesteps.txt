At t=3.2s, Obstacle 30805 is located 1.64m longitudinally and -8.85m laterally relative to the ego vehicle, approaching at -7.23 m/s longitudinally. Given its proximity and speed, it presents a high risk.

Obstacle 30807 is directly to the right of the ego vehicle, laterally -8.89m, with a longitudinal velocity of -7.20 m/s.  Due to the lateral position and non-zero closing velocity, this obstacle also poses a high risk.

Obstacle 30808 is 1.53m longitudinally and -5.35m laterally from the ego, approaching at -7.23 m/s longitudinally.  The short distance and closing speed make this obstacle a high risk as well.

Obstacle 30810 is directly ahead of the ego vehicle at a distance of 1.31m, closing at -7.23 m/s. This is extremely close and represents an extreme risk of collision.


Risk Levels:
0: Collision - Physical contact occurred or unavoidable
1: Extreme Risk - Immediate collision likely
2: High Risk - Close to collision, needs quick action
3: Medium Risk - Manageable with proper reaction
4: Low Risk - Minimal risk, sufficient time to react
5: Negligible Risk - No significant risk
