### Safety analysis for timestep 3.2 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

Based on the provided data, it appears there's a high likelihood of collision with Obstacle 30807 within the next timestep (0.1 seconds). The longitudinal and lateral distances are both 0, indicating a current collision or overlap. The relative velocity and acceleration data further suggest this isn't a momentary overlap but an ongoing collision.  Other obstacles also pose significant risks due to their proximity and closing velocities.

**Assumptions and Calculations:**

* **Adjusted Distances:** I'm assuming adjusted distances (adjusted_d_long and adjusted_d_lat) are the same as "real distance" in the provided context, as no specific values for adjusted distances were given.
* **TTC:**  TTC is calculated as  `distance / relative_velocity`. If the relative velocity is zero or positive (moving away), TTC is considered infinite (or a very large value indicating no immediate risk).
* **MDC:**  MDC is the minimum projected distance based on current positions and velocities.  In this scenario, since the "real distance" is already given at each timestep, I'm using this as a proxy for MDC. However, a more accurate MDC would require predicting the position of the obstacles at the point of closest approach using both velocity and acceleration.

### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 30805**
    - Distance Risk reason:  The obstacle is 1.64m in both longitudinal and lateral direction to the Front-right of the ego vehicle and approaching quickly.
    - Distance safety score: 2 (High Risk)
    - Time Risk reason:  Given the current closing velocity, a collision is likely in the next time step.
    - Time safety score: 1 (Extreme Risk)
    - Overall Risk score: 1 (Extreme Risk)
