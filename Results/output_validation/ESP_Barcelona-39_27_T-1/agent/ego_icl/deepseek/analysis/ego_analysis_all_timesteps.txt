Let me analyze each obstacle at the most recent timestep (3.2 seconds) with trajectory context:

1. Obstacle 30805 (Front-right):
   - Current adjusted position: longitudinal 1.64m, lateral -8.85m
   - Relative velocity: longitudinal -7.23 m/s (approaching), lateral 0.00 m/s
   - Trajectory: Consistently approaching longitudinally with decreasing distance
   - TTC (longitudinal): 1.64/7.23 = 0.23s (Extreme Risk)
   - MDC: Lateral distance remains large (8.85m), so primary risk is longitudinal
   - Overall Risk: 1 (Extreme Risk due to very low TTC)

2. Obstacle 30807 (Right):
   - Current adjusted position: longitudinal 0.00m (aligned), lateral -8.89m
   - Relative velocity: longitudinal -7.20 m/s, lateral 0.00 m/s
   - Trajectory: Laterally aligned but maintaining distance
   - MDC: 8.89m lateral (No Risk)
   - Despite longitudinal alignment, no collision risk due to large lateral distance
   - Overall Risk: 5 (No Risk)

3. Obstacle 30808 (Front-right):
   - Current adjusted position: longitudinal 1.53m, lateral -5.35m
   - Relative velocity: longitudinal -7.23 m/s, lateral 0.00 m/s
   - Trajectory: Approaching longitudinally but maintaining lateral distance
   - TTC (longitudinal): 1.53/7.23 = 0.21s (Extreme Risk)
   - MDC: 5.35m lateral (Low Risk)
   - Overall Risk: 1 (Extreme Risk due to very low TTC)

4. Obstacle 30810 (Front):
   - Current adjusted position: longitudinal 1.31m, lateral 0.00m
   - Relative velocity: longitudinal -7.23 m/s, lateral 0.00 m/s
   - Trajectory: Directly ahead in same lane with rapid approach
   - TTC: 1.31/7.23 = 0.18s (Extreme Risk)
   - MDC: 0.00m lateral (Collision if longitudinal closes)
   - Overall Risk: 0 (Imminent collision)

Predicted Collision:
- Obstacle 30810 is on direct collision course (0.18s TTC) with exact lateral alignment
- Obstacles 30805 and 30808 also have extreme risk but larger lateral distances
