### Detailed Obstacle Analysis

#### Obstacle 30805
- **Position**: Front-right of the ego car.
- **Adjusted Distances at 3.2s**: Longitudinal = 1.64m, Lateral = -8.85m.
- **Trajectory & Motion**: Driving towards the ego car longitudinally with no lateral motion.
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal = -7.23 m/s (approaching).
- **Relative Acceleration**: Longitudinal = 3.56 m/s².
- **TTC Calculation**: Longitudinal = 1.64m / 7.23 m/s = approx. 0.227 s.
- **MDC**: Adjusted longitudinal distance is already low (1.64m).

**Risk Assessment**:
- With a very low TTC and already small adjusted longitudinal distances, this obstacle is extremely likely to collide soon.
- **Risk Level**: Extreme Risk (1).

#### Obstacle 30807
- **Position**: Right of the ego car.
- **Adjusted Distances at 3.2s**: Longitudinal = 0.00m (exact alignment), Lateral = -8.89m.
- **Trajectory & Motion**: Maintaining lateral movement away.
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal = -7.20 m/s, Lateral = 0.00 m/s.
- **Relative Acceleration**: Longitudinal = 3.54 m/s², yet aligned longitudinally.
- **TTC Calculation**: Not applicable due to longitudinal alignment and lateral motion away.

**Risk Assessment**:
- Despite the longitudinal alignment, lateral movement away indicates no immediate collision threat. 
- **Risk Level**: No significant risk due to non-converging trajectories. No Risk (5).

#### Obstacle 30808
- **Position**: Front-right of the ego car.
- **Adjusted Distances at 3.2s**: Longitudinal = 1.53m, Lateral = -5.35m.
- **Trajectory & Motion**: Driving towards the ego car longitudinally with no lateral motion.
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal = -7.23 m/s.
- **Relative Acceleration**: Longitudinal = 3.56 m/s².
- **TTC Calculation**: Longitudinal = 1.53m / 7.23 m/s = approx. 0.212 s.
- **MDC**: Adjusted longitudinal distance quite low.

**Risk Assessment**:
- Similar to Obstacle 30805, with similar risk levels due to near collision.
- **Risk Level**: Extreme Risk (1).

#### Obstacle 30810
- **Position**: Front of the ego car.
- **Adjusted Distances at 3.2s**: Longitudinal = 1.31m, Lateral = 0.00m.
- **Trajectory & Motion**: Driving towards the ego car longitudinally; exact lateral alignment.
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal = -7.23 m/s.
- **Relative Acceleration**: Longitudinal = 3.56 m/s².
- **TTC Calculation**: Longitudinal = 1.31m / 7.23 m/s = approx. 0.181 s.
- **MDC**: Extremely low distance in longitudinal direction; lateral alignment indicates very high collision risk.

**Risk Assessment**:
- This obstacle is aligned with the highest risk level due to the critical distances and alignment.
- **Risk Level**: Extreme Risk (1).

### Summary
- **Most Dangerous Obstacles**: Critical alignment and high closing velocities.
- **Collision Occurrence**: Based on the analysis, immediate collision likelihoods are present for several obstacles.
