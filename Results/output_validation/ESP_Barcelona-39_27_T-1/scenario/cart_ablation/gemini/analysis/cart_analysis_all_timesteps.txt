At t=3.4s, the ego vehicle at (291.442, 5.1941) is decelerating significantly. Let's analyze the risk regarding the closest obstacles.

Obstacle 30808 at (289.6823, -2.9459) is the closest obstacle laterally, but poses no immediate collision risk due to the significant longitudinal separation.  Obstacle 30805 at (287.2637, -5.4749) is further away and poses even less risk. Obstacle 30810 at (294.5163, 2.1166) is further ahead and poses no risk. Finally, obstacle 30807 at (281.9602, -0.1387) is relatively far from the ego vehicle and moving slowly, posing no immediate threat.

Although the ego vehicle is decelerating sharply, based on the current positions and velocities, a collision is not imminent within the next timestep.  Therefore, no obstacles present a collision or extreme risk.
