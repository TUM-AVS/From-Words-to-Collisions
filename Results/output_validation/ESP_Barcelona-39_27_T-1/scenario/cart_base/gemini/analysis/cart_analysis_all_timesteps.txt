At t=3.4s, the ego vehicle (30809.0) is at (291.442, 5.1941) and decelerating.  Obstacle 30808.0 is stationary at (289.6823, -2.9459).  While the y-coordinates are significantly different, the x-coordinates are close and converging. Given the ego vehicle's deceleration, a collision is not imminent in the next immediate timestep, but the rapid deceleration combined with the proximity in x-coordinates suggests a high risk of collision if the ego vehicle continues its current trajectory and deceleration pattern. Obstacle 30807.0 is far and slow-moving, presenting negligible risk. Obstacle 30805.0 and 30810.0 are stationary and sufficiently far from the ego vehicle's current trajectory, also posing negligible risk.
