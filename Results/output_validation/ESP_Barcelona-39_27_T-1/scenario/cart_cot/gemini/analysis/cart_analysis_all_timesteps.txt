### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 30805.0
- Distance Risk reason: The obstacle is located in a different lanelet (1979.0) than the ego vehicle (4275.0) at the last timestep.  Consistent lateral separation observed across all timesteps. No indication of movement.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: The obstacle is stationary. No risk from relative velocity or acceleration.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 30807.0
- Distance Risk reason: Located in a different lanelet (4278.0) than the ego vehicle (4275.0).  Maintained safe lateral distance throughout the scenario while exhibiting minimal movement.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason:  The obstacle is moving very slowly, and its deceleration further reduces any potential time-based risk.  No threat of collision.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 30808.0
- Distance Risk reason:  The obstacle is in a different lanelet (1978.0) than the ego vehicle (4275.0). Lateral separation is consistently maintained through all timesteps. Stationary position.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: The obstacle is stationary, thus posing no time-dependent risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 30810.0
- Distance Risk reason: The obstacle is in a different lanelet (1976.0) than the ego vehicle (4275.0) and consistently maintains a safe lateral distance.  It has not moved throughout the scenario.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: The obstacle remains stationary, presenting no time-related collision risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5


### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. **Most critical obstacles:** Initially, obstacle 30808.0 appeared most critical due to its proximity in the Y-axis, but it remains stationary. As the ego vehicle changes lanelets to 4275, no obstacles share the same lanelet.

2. **Trajectory Analysis:** The ego vehicle moves with a decreasing velocity and varying deceleration, initially in lanelet 1966 and then 4275. All other obstacles are stationary, except for 30807.0, which shows minimal movement within its lanelet.

3. **Relative Position, Velocity & Acceleration:**  The ego vehicle's X-coordinate increases over time as expected. The Y-coordinate decreases as it appears to be changing lanes. The lateral distances to all obstacles remain significant throughout. The ego vehicle's velocity decreases, further reducing the collision risk.  The relative velocities and accelerations with stationary obstacles don't pose a risk.

4. **Collision Determination:**  No collision has occurred or is imminent based on the observed trajectories and constant lateral separation.

5. **Reasoning:**  The key factors are the consistent lateral separation between the ego vehicle and the obstacles, the stationary nature of most obstacles, and the minimal movement of obstacle 30807.0 confined to its lanelet.  The ego vehicle’s change of lanelet to 4275, where no other obstacles are present, further solidifies the absence of collision risk.

### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
  "CollisionObstacles": null,
  "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null,
  "ScenarioAnalysis": {
    "IsCollisionScenario": false,
    "Reasoning": "No collision is detected or predicted.  All obstacles maintain a safe lateral distance from the ego vehicle throughout the scenario. Most obstacles are stationary, and obstacle 30807.0 only exhibits minimal movement within its own lanelet.  The ego vehicle’s lane change to 4275 further mitigates any perceived risk, as no other objects share this lanelet."
