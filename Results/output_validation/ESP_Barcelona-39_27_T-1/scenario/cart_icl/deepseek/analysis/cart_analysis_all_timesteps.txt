   - **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: Static, no relative velocity.
   - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low Risk)

2. **Obstacle ID: 30806.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Moving away from ego (Y-coordinate decreasing). Current position (279.4435, -46.1755), ~51.37m away.
   - **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: Moving away at ~1.92m/s with minor acceleration fluctuations.
   - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)

3. **Obstacle ID: 30807.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Near ego's path at (281.9602, -0.1387), ~5.33m lateral distance. Minimal movement over time.
   - **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: Very slow velocity (~0.019m/s) and decelerating.
   - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low Risk)

4. **Obstacle ID: 30808.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Static at (289.6823, -2.9459), ~8.14m lateral distance. No movement.
   - **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: Static, no relative velocity.
   - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low Risk)

5. **Obstacle ID: 30810.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Static at (294.5163, 2.1166), ~5.02m ahead and ~5.02m lateral. No movement.
   - **Distance safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: Static, but closer to ego's decelerating path.
   - **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 3 (Medium Risk)

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. Ego is decelerating (current velocity: 5.9172m/s, acceleration: -3.8764m/sÂ²).
2. No obstacles are on a direct collision course (all lateral distances > 5m).
3. Obstacle 30810.0 is the closest but remains static and is not in the immediate path.
4. All other obstacles are either static or moving away.
5. No collision or extreme risk detected.
