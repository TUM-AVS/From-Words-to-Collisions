### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 30805.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is far from ego and not on a collision course based on trajectories.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Obstacle is stationary.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 30807.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is far from ego and poses no immediate threat.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Obstacle is moving slowly and not towards ego.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 30808.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is somewhat close to ego, but not in direct path.  Ego's trajectory suggests it's moving away.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Obstacle is stationary.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 4

- Obstacle ID: 30810.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is relatively far from ego. Trajectories don't intersect in the near term.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Obstacle is stationary.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5


### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
No obstacles pose an immediate collision risk. Ego is moving away from obstacle 30808, the closest obstacle, and the others are stationary and further away.  This is not a collision scenario.


### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
  "CollisionObstacles": [],
  "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null,
  "ScenarioAnalysis": {
    "IsCollisionScenario": false,
    "Reasoning": "No obstacle is on a collision course with the ego vehicle. The closest obstacle (30808) is stationary and the ego vehicle's trajectory indicates movement away from it.  All other obstacles are stationary and further away."
  }
}
