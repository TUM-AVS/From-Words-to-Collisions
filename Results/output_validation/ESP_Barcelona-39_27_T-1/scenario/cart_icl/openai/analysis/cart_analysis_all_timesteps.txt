### Obstacle Analysis:

#### Obstacle ID: 30805.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: The position has remained consistent at (287.2637, -5.4749) with zero velocity and acceleration, indicating it is stationary. The obstacle is not in the direct path of ego and is in a different lanelet (1979.0 vs 4275.0).
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: No movement or velocity changes over the observed timesteps.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 30807.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: A slow moving obstacle with a velocity decreasing from 0.0476 to 0.019 m/s. It is in a different lanelet (4278.0 vs 4275.0 for ego) and shows a negative acceleration trend, indicating it's moving away slowly.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: Minimal speed and consistent deceleration trend highlight negligible future threat.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 30808.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: Remains stationary at (289.6823, -2.9459) across the time interval. Positioned outside the path of ego and different lanelet (1978.0).
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: Stationary status with zero velocity and acceleration.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 30810.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: Stationary at (294.5163, 2.1166) throughout and in a different lanelet (1976.0). It's further away and not in the direct path.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: Has not moved, confirming position as fixed with zero velocity.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
- **Trajectory and Position**: None of the obstacles are in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle at the most recent time step. They are also stationary or moving away minimally from or towards the ego vehicle.
- **Velocity and Acceleration Analysis**: The ego vehicle is moving and gradually decelerating. No obstacles depict any acceleration that would suggest increased risk.
- **Collision Risk**: Given the observations, there's no significant risk of collision from any obstacle in this scenario. They are either stationary or moving too slowly to pose an immediate threat.
