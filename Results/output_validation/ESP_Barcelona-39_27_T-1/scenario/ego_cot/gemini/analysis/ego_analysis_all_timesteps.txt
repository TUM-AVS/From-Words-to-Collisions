### Safety analysis for timestep 2.5: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 30805
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is at 8.36m longitudinally and laterally, posing no immediate threat but requiring monitoring due to its front-right position and closing velocity.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Approaching at -10.36 m/s longitudinally with a positive acceleration (1.11 m/s²), suggesting the closing speed might reduce, giving some time to react.  No lateral relative motion.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3

- Obstacle ID: 30807
- Distance Risk reason: Extremely close at 0.8m longitudinally and laterally in the front-right, indicating a very high risk of imminent collision.
- Distance safety score: 1
- Time Risk reason: High closing velocity (-10.31 m/s) with minimal positive acceleration.  Lateral movement towards the ego vehicle further increases the risk.
- Time safety score: 1
- Overall Risk score: 1

- Obstacle ID: 30808
- Distance Risk reason: Similar to Obstacle 30805, situated at 8.25m longitudinally and laterally in the front-right, requiring attention but not posing an immediate threat.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Similar closing velocity (-10.36 m/s) and positive acceleration (1.11 m/s²) as Obstacle 30805. No lateral relative motion.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3

- Obstacle ID: 30810
- Distance Risk reason: Located 8.02m directly in front, presenting less lateral risk than 30805/30808 but still needing monitoring due to closing velocity.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Similar closing velocity (-10.36 m/s) and acceleration (1.11 m/s²) as 30805/30808. Lateral movement is uncertain.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3

Key Observations:

* **Obstacle 30807:** Collides with the ego vehicle at 2.6 seconds. This is the most critical threat.
* **Obstacle 30810:** Collides with the ego vehicle at 3.4 seconds.
* **Obstacles 30805 and 30808:**  While not colliding as immediately as 30807 and 30810, they represent extremely high risks, especially by 3.4 seconds.  The ego vehicle needs to take evasive action to avoid collision with these as well.

The positive longitudinal acceleration of the obstacles suggests some braking, but it's not sufficient to avoid the collision, particularly with 30807 and 30810. The lateral movement of obstacle 30807 towards the ego vehicle in the initial stages further exacerbates the risk.
