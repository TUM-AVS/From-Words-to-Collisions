**Obstacle-by-Obstacle Analysis:**

1. **Obstacle 30805:**
   - **Position:** Front-right (0.19 m longitudinal, -8.84 m lateral)
   - **Relative Velocity:** -5.92 m/s longitudinally, no lateral motion
   - **Motion:** Moving toward the ego vehicle longitudinally, no lateral motion.
   - **TTC Calculation (Longitudinal):** 
     - TTC = 0.19 m / 5.92 m/s â‰ˆ 0.032 s (very low)
   - **MDC Calculation (Longitudinal):**
     - 0.19 m (approaching)
   - **Risk Assessment:** 
     - Extreme risk due to very low TTC (< 0.5 s). 

2. **Obstacle 30807:**
   - **Position:** Right (0.00 m longitudinal, -8.90 m lateral)
   - **Relative Velocity:** -5.90 m/s longitudinal, no significant lateral motion towards the ego
   - **Motion:** Exact longitudinal alignment; approaching laterally.
   - **TTC Calculation (Lateral):** 
     - Not calculated due to minimal lateral motion. Primary focus on longitudinal alignment.
   - **MDC Calculation (Longitudinal):**
     - Exact alignment, significant lateral distance (no immediate collision risk)
   - **Risk Assessment:** 
     - Low to Medium risk, given the lateral aspect is stable and moving lateral velocity is small.

3. **Obstacle 30808:**
   - **Position:** Front-right (0.08 m longitudinal, -5.34 m lateral)
   - **Relative Velocity:** -5.92 m/s longitudinal, no lateral motion
   - **Motion:** Moving toward the ego vehicle longitudinally, no lateral motion.
   - **TTC Calculation (Longitudinal):** 
     - TTC = 0.08 m / 5.92 m/s = 0.013 s (very low)
   - **MDC Calculation (Longitudinal):**
     - 0.08 m (approaching)
   - **Risk Assessment:** 
     - Extreme risk due to TTC < 0.5 s and close proximity.

4. **Obstacle 30810:**
   - **Position:** Directly in Front (0.00 m longitudinal, 0.00 m lateral)
   - **Relative Velocity:** -5.92 m/s longitudinal, no lateral motion
   - **Motion:** Complete alignment, both longitudinally and laterally.
   - **TTC Calculation:** 
     - TTC = 0.00 m (impact already occurred)
   - **MDC Calculation:**
     - 0.00 m (exact alignment, collision occurring)
   - **Risk Assessment:** 
     - Collision (Score 0) as indicated by both distance and motion description.

**Trajectory Analysis Across Timesteps:**
- Obstacle 30810 consistently decreased longitudinal distance across all timesteps, indicating an unavoidable trajectory with the ego vehicle.
- Similarly, Obstacle 30808 and 30805 show critical approach velocities with minimal to zero distances.

**Collision Scenario Determination:**
- This scenario is identified as a collision scenario due to Obstacle 30810 exhibiting a collision score of 0 (impact occurring) with further support from Obstacle 30808 presenting an extreme risk score of 1 (imminent collision).

**Conclusion and JSON Summary:**
- Based on the assessments, this is undeniably a collision scenario primarily driven by the actual impact already occurring with Obstacle 30810 and the extreme risks presented by other nearby obstacles.
