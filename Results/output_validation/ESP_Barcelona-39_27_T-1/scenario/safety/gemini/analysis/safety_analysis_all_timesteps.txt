    - Distance Risk Reason: DTClong is 0.19m indicating extreme risk, while DTClat is -8.84m suggesting no lateral risk. The obstacle has been approaching longitudinally over the past timesteps.
    - Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 1
    - Lateral Distance Safety Score: 5
    - Overall Distance Safety Score: 3.0 (1 * 0.5 + 5 * 0.5)
    - Time Risk Reason: TTClong is 0.03s indicating extreme risk. TTClat is inf, showing no lateral risk. The trend shows a rapid decrease in TTClong, highlighting immediate danger.
    - Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 1
    - Lateral Time Safety Score: 5
    - Overall Time Safety Score: 3.0 (1 * 0.5 + 5 * 0.5)
    - Overall Risk Score: 3 (0.5 * 3.0 + 0.5 * 3.0 = 3.0)

    - Obstacle ID: 30807
    - Relative Direction: Right
    - Distance Risk Reason: DTClong is 0.0m, and DTClat is -8.90m. Though laterally safe, the zero longitudinal distance indicates collision.
    - Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 0
    - Lateral Distance Safety Score: 5
    - Overall Distance Safety Score: 5.0 (0 * 0.0 + 5 * 1.0)
    - Time Risk Reason: TTClong is 0.0s indicating collision risk. TTClat is 277776.40s, suggesting no lateral risk. The longitudinal collision is imminent.
    - Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 0
    - Lateral Time Safety Score: 5
    - Overall Time Safety Score: 5.0 (0 * 0.0 + 5 * 1.0)
    - Overall Risk Score: 5 (0.5 * 5.0 + 0.5 * 5.0 = 5.0)

    - Obstacle ID: 30808
    - Relative Direction: Front-right
    - Distance Risk Reason: DTClong is 0.08m, indicating extreme risk. DTClat is -5.34m, posing no lateral risk. Longitudinal distance has rapidly decreased over previous timesteps.
    - Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 1
    - Lateral Distance Safety Score: 5
    - Overall Distance Safety Score: 3.0 (1 * 0.5 + 5 * 0.5)
    - Time Risk Reason: TTClong is 0.01s, indicating extreme risk and almost certain collision. TTClat is inf, indicating no lateral risk. The longitudinal collision is imminent based on past TTClong values.
    - Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 1
    - Lateral Time Safety Score: 5
    - Overall Time Safety Score: 3.0 (1 * 0.5 + 5 * 0.5)
    - Overall Risk Score: 3 (0.5 * 3.0 + 0.5 * 3.0 = 3.0)

    - Obstacle ID: 30810
    - Relative Direction: Front
    - Distance Risk Reason: Both DTClong (0.0m) and DTClat (0.0m) suggest a collision.
    - Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 0
    - Lateral Distance Safety Score: 0
    - Overall Distance Safety Score: 0.0 (0 * 1.0 + 0 * 0.0)
    - Time Risk Reason: Both TTClong (0.0s) and TTClat (0.0s) confirm a collision.
    - Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 0
    - Lateral Time Safety Score: 0
    - Overall Time Safety Score: 0.0 (0 * 1.0 + 0 * 0.0)
    - Overall Risk Score: 0 (0.5 * 0.0 + 0.5 * 0.0 = 0.0)
