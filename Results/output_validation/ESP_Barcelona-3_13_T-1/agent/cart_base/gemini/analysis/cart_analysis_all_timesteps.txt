Here's the analysis of the scenario and the resulting JSON.

**Analysis:**

The ego vehicle (30765.0) is moving slowly with a slightly decreasing velocity and appears to be in lane 3652.0 throughout the provided timeframe.  Let's consider each obstacle:

* **30750.0, 30754.0, 30757.0, 30758.0:** These obstacles are stationary and far from the ego vehicle, posing negligible risk.

* **30755.0:** This obstacle is in lane 3651.0, adjacent to the ego vehicle and initially moving faster, but it's decelerating significantly throughout the scenario.  While the raw distance values might not seem incredibly large, they are not indicative of an immediate collision, and the rapid deceleration of 30755.0 further lessens the risk. It is worth monitoring, but currently isn't a high risk.

* **30762.0:** This obstacle is in lane 1164.0, and while it has a higher velocity, its lane and trajectory don't appear to directly intersect with the ego vehicle's path in the near future, therefore not a high risk of collision.

* **30763.0:** This obstacle is in lane 3653.0 and is moving towards the ego vehicle. It is braking as seen from its negative acceleration, therefore it warrants attention as medium risk.

* **30764.0:** This obstacle is in lane 1165.0 and appears to be moving very quickly, but it's in a different lane and isn't showing signs of directly intersecting the ego vehicle's path imminently, therefore it has minimal risk.

* **30766.0:** This obstacle is in lane 3650.0, adjacent to the ego vehicle. Although it is rapidly decelerating, its proximity and initial speed makes it warrant monitoring for a potential high risk situation soon.

Given that no collision is imminent or has occurred, and no obstacle poses an extreme or high risk in the immediate future, all risk scores are above 2 (high risk).
