### Analysis:

- **Ego Vehicle (ID: 30765.0):** 
  - The ego vehicle is moving slowly with a velocity of around 0.8741 m/s and a very low acceleration, slightly fluctuating around zero.
  - Its orientation changes very minimally, indicating a steady path within its lanelet (3652.0).

- **Obstacle 30750.0 and 30754.0:**
  - Both obstacles are stationary over the entire duration. They remain distant from the ego vehicle, posing negligible risk.

- **Obstacle 30755.0:**
  - It is present in lanelet 3651.0, with a decreasing velocity that started from 3.2199 m/s at the beginning, reducing to 1.6263 m/s, indicating it is slowing down.
  - At the final timestep, its position (-87.5919, -188.0819) is becoming relatively closer to the ego vehicle but still not within immediate collision range.
  - This obstacle should be monitored but does not yet present imminent danger.

- **Obstacle 30762.0:**
  - Previously moving along lanelet 1164.0, this obstacle transitioned to lanelet 3651.0 at t=4.3 seconds, slightly ahead of the ego vehicle but not in immediate collision path.
  - It has a relatively higher velocity, decreasing from 6.5078 m/s to 4.7667 m/s, indicating it's decelerating but still moving faster than other obstacles in proximity.
  - Given its ongoing trajectory towards the ego lane, it poses an increased risk of coming nearer over subsequent seconds.

- **Obstacle 30763.0:**
  - Positioned reliably in lanelet 3653.0, moving at a decreasing velocity from 4.7846 m/s to 2.9826 m/s.
  - Its trajectory and positioning make it less likely to intersect with the ego's path.

- **Obstacle 30766.0:**
  - Displaying gradually decreasing velocity from 7.8856 m/s to 5.3009 m/s, situated in lanelet 3650.0.
  - It had previously been approaching the ego's lane but shows no immediate trajectory crossover.
  
### Summary:
- **Collision (0 Risk Score):** No collision is detected with any obstacle in the most recent timestep.
- **Extreme Risk (1 Risk Score):** Obstacle 30762.0 due to its accelerating approach into the same lanelet as the ego, albeit at a decreasing rate.
- **High Risk (2 Risk Score):** Obstacle 30755.0 due to its proximity in a neighboring lanelet and slow velocity reduction indicating possible lateral movement risk.
