Obstacle 30764 is approaching the ego vehicle at high speed, and the distance between them is decreasing across the timesteps.  The ego vehicle is also accelerating slightly. While a collision is not imminent in the next second, the high closing speed and relatively small distance warrant a high-risk assessment.

Obstacle 30762 is moderately far from the ego vehicle, but its high speed and decreasing distance suggest a potential risk. It needs further monitoring.

Obstacle 30766 is also moving quickly and getting closer to the ego vehicle, although not as rapidly as obstacle 30764.

Obstacle 30763 is relatively close and approaching the ego vehicle, but its speed is decreasing, which lowers the risk. It still requires attention.

Obstacle 30755 is also relatively close, its speed is decreasing across the timesteps.

The other obstacles are stationary or far enough away to pose no immediate threat.
