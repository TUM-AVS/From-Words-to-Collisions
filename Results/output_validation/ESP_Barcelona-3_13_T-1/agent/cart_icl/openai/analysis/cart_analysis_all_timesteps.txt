To evaluate the scenario at the most recent timestep (4.4 seconds), let's analyze each obstacle's motion relative to the Ego vehicle.

### Relative Motion Analysis:

- **Ego**: At 3.5 seconds, Ego’s position was (-99.3616, -181.1613), with a steady but very low velocity of approximately 0.8741 units, indicating minimal forward movement throughout the timeline. 

- **Obstacles**:
  - **Obstacle 30750**: Stationary, far behind Ego. No immediate risk.
  - **Obstacle 30754**: Stationary, far behind Ego. No immediate risk.
  - **Obstacle 30755**: Closing on Ego’s lane with decreasing distance. Positioned (-87.5919, -188.0819) at -1.5379 acceleration, showing a slow-down. The relative velocity isn’t rapidly diminishing, but it remains well behind Ego. Still, given its motion tendency towards the Ego's lane and its deceleration, careful observation is necessary.
  - **Obstacle 30757**: Stationary, far left from Ego. No immediate risk.
  - **Obstacle 30758**: Stationary, far left from Ego. No immediate risk.
  - **Obstacle 30762**: Moving with velocity and acceleration changes, positioned (-97.6258, -177.9364) with observed approach towards the Ego. Given the projected path, keeping eyes on this obstacle as it could come into potential conflict.
  - **Obstacle 30763**: Moving parallel close to Ego but slightly behind it. Its trajectory continues within its lane not presenting a direct collision path at present.
  - **Obstacle 30764**: Continuous movement (-102.6694, -177.8197), highly lateral positioning compared to the Ego without an intersecting lane path, despite notable speed.
  - **Obstacle 30766**: Positioned (-89.3049, -181.3742), its speed combined with lateral movements suggest a trajectory passing near, without intersection. However, closing velocity should be recognized for potential shifts.

### Summary of Risks:

- **Collision Risk (0)**: No obstacle meets the immediate physical contact scenario.
- **Extreme Risk (1)**: No imminent and highly probable collision unless drastic unforeseen changes.
- **High Risk (2)**: Obstacle 30762 emerges as a primary concern due to its position directly transitioning towards Ego's potential path with earlier velocity components and positional direction urging observation.

Given these observations, the precise evaluation continues with JSON encapsulating only the high, extreme, and collision-level risks.
