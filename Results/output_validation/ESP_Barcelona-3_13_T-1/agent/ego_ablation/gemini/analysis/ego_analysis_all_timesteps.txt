At timestamp 4.4 seconds, Obstacle 30764 poses a high risk due to its proximity and Time-To-Collision (TTC). Obstacle 30762 is a medium risk. The other obstacles are low to no risk.

**Obstacle 30764 (High Risk):** This obstacle is very close behind the ego vehicle (-0.98m) and approaching rapidly with a relative longitudinal velocity of 5.69 m/s.  This calculates to a TTC of less than 1 second, making a collision highly likely if the trajectories are maintained. Thus, Proximity (2), MDC (2), and TTC (2) all point to a high risk. Overall risk score is 2.

**Obstacle 30762 (Medium Risk):** This obstacle is positioned to the left of the ego vehicle (1.89m) with longitudinal alignment, suggesting that there is no immediate risk of collision. Additionally, it has a moderate relative longitudinal velocity of 3.89 m/s, resulting in a TTC greater than 1 second. So, although this object is relatively near the ego vehicle and there may be a potential collision risk, the overall risk of a collision at this moment is medium. While there is no longitudinal relative motion, the lateral motion needs careful monitoring. This warrants a Proximity (3), MDC (3), and TTC (3). The overall risk is 3.

**Other Obstacles:** Obstacles 30750, 30754, 30757, and 30758 are far ahead of the ego and do not pose immediate threats. Obstacle 30755 is moving away longitudinally and poses a low risk. Obstacle 30763 is moving away longitudinally, and poses low to medium risk, requiring monitoring due to its lateral movement toward the ego vehicle. Obstacle 30766 is moving away longitudinally and poses a low risk due to sufficient lateral distance.
