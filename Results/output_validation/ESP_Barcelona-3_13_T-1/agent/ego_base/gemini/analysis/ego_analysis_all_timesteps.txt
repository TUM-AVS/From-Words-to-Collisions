Risk Levels:
0: Collision - Physical contact occurred or unavoidable
1: Extreme Risk - Immediate collision likely
2: High Risk - Close to collision, needs quick action
3: Medium Risk - Manageable with proper reaction
4: Low Risk - Minimal risk, sufficient time to react
5: Negligible Risk - No significant risk
