### Safety analysis for timestep 4.4s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

**Assumptions and Calculations:**

* **Adjusted Distance:**  Since raw DTClong and DTClat are provided, and no vehicle dimensions are given, we'll use these directly.  In a real-world scenario, you would subtract ego and obstacle vehicle dimensions (length/width) as appropriate to get more precise adjusted distances.
* **TTC Calculation:** TTC = Distance / Relative Velocity.  We'll calculate TTC longitudinally (TTClong) and laterally (TTClat) where applicable.  If the relative velocity is zero or moving away, TTC is considered infinite (no collision risk in that direction).
* **MDC Calculation:** This will be the minimum adjusted distance observed during the scenario.
