At t=4.6s, the ego vehicle at (-98.68, -181.85) is traveling at 0.87 m/s.  Several obstacles are nearby, but none present an immediate collision risk. Obstacle 30766 is the closest, located at (-88.61, -182.08) and traveling at 4.75 m/s. While its trajectory indicates decreasing speed, the current separation and relative velocities suggest a low risk of collision. Other obstacles are further away and/or stationary. Thus, no obstacle poses a collision or extreme risk.
