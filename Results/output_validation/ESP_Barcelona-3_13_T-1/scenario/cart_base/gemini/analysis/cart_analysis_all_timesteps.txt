Obstacle 30766 is the closest to the ego vehicle and has a high closing velocity.  Its predicted positions in the near future suggest a possible collision. Obstacle 30764 is also relatively close and moving fast, though its trajectory appears less likely to intersect directly with the ego vehicle's in the immediate future. Obstacle 30762 is further away but has a very high velocity and deceleration, making its future trajectory somewhat unpredictable and potentially risky. Other obstacles are not considered high risk in this immediate timestep.  However, given the relative speeds and positions, obstacle 30766 stands out as posing the most immediate risk.
