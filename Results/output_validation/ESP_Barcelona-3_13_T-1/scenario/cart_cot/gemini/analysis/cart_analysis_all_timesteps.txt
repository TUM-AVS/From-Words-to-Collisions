- Obstacle ID: 30762.0
- Distance Risk reason: Ahead of ego, but in a different lanelet and moving faster.  Historical data shows a decreasing distance but diverging paths due to different lanelets.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Although moving faster than ego, it's moving away and decelerating.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- Obstacle ID: 30763.0
- Distance Risk reason: Located behind the ego vehicle and in adjacent lane.  Historical data shows it's moving slower and decelerating.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Moving slower and decelerating, increasing distance from ego over time.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- Obstacle ID: 30764.0
- Distance Risk reason: Ahead of ego, but in a different lanelet and moving faster. Historical data confirms different lanelet trajectories.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Although moving faster than ego and decelerating, safe distance maintained due to separate lanes.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- Obstacle ID: 30766.0
- Distance Risk reason: Behind and to the side of the ego vehicle.  Historical data shows it is closing in, but decelerating rapidly.  
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: Despite its deceleration, the closing distance requires monitoring.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3


### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. **Most critical obstacles:** Obstacle 30766.0 poses the highest risk due to its proximity and closing distance, even though it's decelerating. Obstacles 30762.0 and 30764.0, while moving faster than the ego, maintain a safe distance due to their different lanelet trajectories.
2. **Trajectories:**  Over the 10 timesteps, the ego vehicle maintains its lane and velocity with minimal deceleration.  Obstacle 30766.0 consistently decelerates while approaching ego from behind. Other obstacles maintain their respective lanes and exhibit deceleration.
3. **Relative positions, velocities, and accelerations:** The analysis above confirms that while some obstacles have higher speeds, they are on diverging paths. Obstacle 30766 shows the highest relative positional risk due to its converging trajectory and proximity, although its negative acceleration is mitigating that risk.
4. **Collision Determination:** Based on the data provided, no collision has occurred or is imminent in the analyzed timeframe.
5. **Reasoning:**  While Obstacle 30766 presents the closest proximity, its deceleration suggests a mitigating action, decreasing the likelihood of collision. The other obstacles, despite their higher velocities, maintain safe distances from the ego vehicle due to their diverging trajectories.
