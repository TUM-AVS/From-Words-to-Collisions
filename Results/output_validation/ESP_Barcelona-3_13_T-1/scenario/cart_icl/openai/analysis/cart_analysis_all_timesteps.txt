### Obstacle Analysis:

**Ego Vehicle Position & Motion**:
- Position at most recent timestep (4.6 seconds): (-98.6835, -181.8467), Velocity: 0.8741, Acceleration: -0.0, Orientation: -0.7902

**Obstacle 30750**:
- Static for all observed timesteps
- Distance Risk reason: Stationary, no change in position relative to the ego vehicle
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Zero velocity, no risk over time
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

**Obstacle 30754**:
- Static for all observed timesteps
- Distance Risk reason: Consistently at same position, no risk to ego vehicle
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Static, thus no temporal risk
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

**Obstacle 30755**:
- Consistent slow movement in a nearby lane
- Distance Risk reason: Gradual movement such that there is no imminent threat to the ego vehicle's lane
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Constant low velocity and maintaining a gap
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

**Obstacle 30757**:
- Static for the duration
- Distance Risk reason: No change in position and not influencing ego vehicle
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: No motion equates to no temporal threat
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

**Obstacle 30758**:
- Static entire observation period
- Distance Risk reason: No change in positioning
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Static, implies no velocity or acceleration influence
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

**Obstacle 30762**:
- Moving further away in a lane separate from ego
- Distance Risk reason: Trajectory diverging from egoâ€™s path, reducing likelihood of collision
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Reducing acceleration and slight velocity indicating divergence
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

**Obstacle 30763**:
- In relatively close proximity and moving, but direction consistent with safe distance
- Distance Risk reason: Nearby yet trajectory and velocity not indicating an intersection with ego
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: Decreasing speed but moving further diversifies path
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3

**Obstacle 30764**:
- Significant velocity, but trajectory diverging from ego vehicle
- Distance Risk reason: High velocity mitigated by trajectory diverging from ego
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: Large speed yet diminishing acceleration suggests controlled environment
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3

**Obstacle 30766**:
- Moving at moderate speed away from potential intersection with ego
- Distance Risk reason: Path and trends depicting increasing distance from ego
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Baud velocities but reducing acceleration offers optimistic risk outlook
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
- None of the obstacles show imminent threat of collision with the ego vehicle, partly due to their steady paths in separate trajectories.
- The risk remains controlled with no increases in proximity or velocity trends suggesting otherwise. 
- Ego vehicle movement remains steady with no sudden changes to invite trajectory collision.
