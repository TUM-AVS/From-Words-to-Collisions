* **Obstacle 30750**:  This obstacle is in the front-right and approaching longitudinally, but the lateral distance is stable and negative. Across the timesteps, we see it steadily approaching longitudinally.  Given the distances (17.0 m longitudinal, -1.9 m lateral) and the relative longitudinal velocity of -0.87 m/s, the TTC longitudinally is approximately 19.5s. MDC is >5m. This obstacle presents no immediate risk. Risk score: 5.

* **Obstacle 30754**: This obstacle is directly in front and approaching longitudinally, with exact lateral alignment (0.00m). The longitudinal distance is decreasing across timesteps. At 16.96m with a closing velocity of -0.87 m/s, the longitudinal TTC is about 19.5s. MDC is >5m. Although laterally aligned, the significant longitudinal distance and slow closing speed indicate no immediate risk. Risk score: 5.

* **Obstacle 30755**: This obstacle is front-left and its longitudinal distance is increasing while lateral distance remains relatively stable. The relative velocity shows it moving away longitudinally (16.98m, 0.51 m/s gives a "negative TTC," meaning it's already past the point of closest approach) but shows a slight lateral approach which has been consistent across timesteps.. MDC is > 5m.  Risk score: 5

* **Obstacle 30757**: This obstacle is in the front-left and approaching longitudinally while the lateral distance is relatively stable. The risk assessment is similar to Obstacle 30750 and 30758. Risk score: 5

* **Obstacle 30758**: This obstacle is front-left, approaching longitudinally with stable and safe lateral distance. Like Obstacle 30750 and 30757, there's no immediate risk. Risk score: 5

* **Obstacle 30762**: This obstacle is to the left side and its longitudinal distance is 0.0m at 4.6 seconds.  Lateral distance is approximately 1.89m with a relative lateral velocity of -0.00m/s. Lateral TTC is not defined due to near-zero velocity, but the distance itself is not an immediate concern. There is a risk if there was some lateral closing motion, but the data shows consistently near 0.00 lateral speed. Risk score: 5

* **Obstacle 30763**: This obstacle is front-right, moving away longitudinally but with a stable lateral distance. No immediate risk. Similar to Obstacle 30750. Risk score: 5

* **Obstacle 30764**: This obstacle was behind the ego vehicle and has reached a collision state (0.00m longitudinal, 0.00m lateral) at 4.6s.  The relative velocity indicates it was approaching rapidly in the timesteps leading up to this point.  Risk score: 0 (Collision).

* **Obstacle 30766**: This obstacle is front-left and moving away longitudinally while the lateral distance remains relatively stable. Similar to obstacle 30755. Risk score: 5


**Conclusion:**

This IS a collision scenario because Obstacle 30764 has collided with the ego vehicle at t=4.6 seconds.
