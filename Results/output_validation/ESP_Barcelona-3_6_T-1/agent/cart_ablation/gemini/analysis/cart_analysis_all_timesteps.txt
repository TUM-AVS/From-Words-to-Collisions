Here's the collision risk analysis:

**Ego Vehicle (30769.0):** The ego vehicle is moving with a decreasing velocity and fluctuating acceleration within lanelet 1165 and 3652. It's crucial to analyze its trajectory concerning other obstacles.

**Obstacle 30750.0:** Stationary and far from the ego vehicle, posing no immediate risk. Risk score: 5

**Obstacle 30754.0:** Stationary and far from the ego vehicle, posing no immediate risk. Risk score: 5

**Obstacle 30755.0:** Stationary and far from the ego vehicle, posing no immediate risk. Risk score: 5

**Obstacle 30757.0:** Initially moving at a moderate speed, this obstacle decelerates significantly and comes almost to a stop over the analyzed time steps. It is located in a different lanelet.  Risk score: 4

**Obstacle 30758.0:**  Moving very slowly and decelerating in lanelet 3651, away from the ego vehicle's trajectory. Risk score: 5

**Obstacle 30762.0:** Initially moving at a relatively high speed in lanelet 1164 and lanelet 3651, but decelerates and is located in a different lanelet to the ego vehicle. Risk score: 4

**Obstacle 30763.0:** Decelerating in lanelet 3653, this obstacle maintains a safe distance from the ego vehicle. Risk score: 4

**Obstacle 30764.0:** Located in the same lanelet (1165) as the ego vehicle, this obstacle is initially moving at a higher speed and then decelerates, but the distance and the relative speed between the two suggest only a low risk of collision. Risk score: 3

**Obstacle 30765.0:** Located in lanelet 1166, this obstacle is also decelerating, and its trajectory does not intersect with the ego vehicle's. Risk score: 4

**Obstacle 30766.0:** Although decelerating in a different lanelet (1164), the proximity of this obstacle and the ego vehicle warrants attention. Risk score: 3

**Obstacle 30767.0:**  This obstacle is moving at a high speed but decelerating in lanelet 1163, which is separated from the ego vehicle's path. Risk score: 4
