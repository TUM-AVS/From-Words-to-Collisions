Here's the analysis of the scenario and the resulting JSON:

**Analysis:**

* **Obstacle 30750, 30754, 30755:** Stationary and far from the ego vehicle, posing no risk. Risk score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
* **Obstacle 30757:** Initially moving towards the ego vehicle, but decelerating significantly over the timesteps.  While the lane proximity might suggest some concern, the deceleration makes a collision unlikely. Risk score: 4 (Low Risk)
* **Obstacle 30758:**  Moving very slowly and remains at a safe distance from the ego vehicle. Risk score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
* **Obstacle 30762:**  Initially somewhat close to the ego and moving faster. However, its trajectory doesn't appear to intersect with the ego vehicle's path, and the ego vehicle also seems to be decelerating and changing lanelets, mitigating much of the risk. This obstacle requires monitoring.  Risk score: 3 (Medium Risk)
* **Obstacle 30763:**  Similar to 30762, this obstacle is moving but in a different lanelet and doesn't seem to pose an immediate threat. Risk score: 4 (Low Risk)
* **Obstacle 30764:** Located in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle and moving considerably faster. Over the time steps, the distance between the ego and this obstacle decreases, while the speed difference is also shrinking (both decelerating, but the obstacle much faster) so  a high risk exists and quick action would be necessary to avoid potential collision. Risk score: 2 (High Risk).
* **Obstacle 30765, 30766, 30767:**  These obstacles are in adjacent lanelets and moving quickly, but their trajectories don't appear to intersect with the ego vehicle's path in the near future. Risk score: 3 (Medium Risk).
