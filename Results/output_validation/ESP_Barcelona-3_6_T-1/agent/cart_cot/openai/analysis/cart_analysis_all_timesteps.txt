### Analysis:

1. **Obstacle 30750, 30754, 30755**:
   - These obstacles are stationary throughout the scenario with no change in their position. Their positions remain considerably far from the ego vehicle. No immediate risk based on their immobility and distance.

2. **Obstacle 30757**:
   - It has a notable deceleration over several timesteps, reaching a near-halt at the most recent timestep.
   - Located approximately 22 meters away from the ego's path and stationary (velocity = 0), it poses a low risk.

3. **Obstacle 30758**:
   - Shows negligible movement and remains at a consistent distance that doesn't intercept the ego's path.

4. **Obstacle 30762**:
   - Initially, had significant velocity, but gradually decelerated. Moving in a path that diverges slightly from the ego vehicle's path trajectory, staying around 5 to 6 meters away.

5. **Obstacle 30763**:
   - Exhibits a consistent slow pace and likely will not reach the ego's path due to its trajectory, showing consistently lower speed and deceleration.

6. **Obstacle 30764**:
   - Positioned on a path that diverges from that of the ego vehicle with a different approach vector, hence low immediate collision risk.

7. **Obstacle 30765**:
   - While moving at a significant speed initially, its trajectory diverges from the ego's lane with no imminent path overlap.

8. **Obstacle 30766**:
   - Maintains slower speed, slowly moving away, and quite some distance apart from the ego's trajectory.

9. **Obstacle 30767**:
   - Although it's fast-moving, its trajectory diverges from the ego vehicle's path at the recent timestep, reducing any immediate collision likelihood.

### Summary:
- None of the obstacles were determined to have direct invasion paths in the immediate future. The highest risks were evaluated based on proximity and matching trajectory potential with the ego vehicle's path.
