### Analysis of Risky Obstacles:

1. **Obstacle 30762 (at 3.4s)**:
   - **Position**: (-96.3258, -179.2515)
   - **Velocity**: 4.4391 m/s
   - **Acceleration**: -3.0798 m/s²
   - **Lanelet**: 3651.0 (same as ego's lanelet at 3.2s)
   - **Relative Motion**: The obstacle is ahead of the ego vehicle and decelerating. The lateral distance is minimal, and the TTC is decreasing as the ego vehicle accelerates.
   - **Risk**: **High Risk (2)** - The obstacle is in the same lane and closing in, but the ego's acceleration might help avoid collision.

2. **Obstacle 30763 (at 3.4s)**:
   - **Position**: (-94.9021, -190.6426)
   - **Velocity**: 3.6888 m/s
   - **Acceleration**: -2.3627 m/s²
   - **Lanelet**: 3653.0 (adjacent to ego's lanelet)
   - **Relative Motion**: The obstacle is moving laterally and decelerating. The lateral distance is significant, but the trajectory could intersect if the ego changes lanes.
   - **Risk**: **Medium Risk (3)** - Manageable with driver/system response.

3. **Obstacle 30764 (at 3.4s)**:
   - **Position**: (-104.133, -176.3405)
   - **Velocity**: 6.8235 m/s
   - **Acceleration**: -2.3617 m/s²
   - **Lanelet**: 1165.0 (same as ego's initial lanelet)
   - **Relative Motion**: The obstacle is ahead and decelerating. The lateral distance is minimal, and the TTC is decreasing.
   - **Risk**: **High Risk (2)** - The obstacle is in the same lane and closing in, but the ego's acceleration might help avoid collision.

4. **Obstacle 30765 (at 3.4s)**:
   - **Position**: (-109.1693, -176.2268)
   - **Velocity**: 7.8675 m/s
   - **Acceleration**: -1.7654 m/s²
   - **Lanelet**: 1166.0 (adjacent to ego's lanelet)
   - **Relative Motion**: The obstacle is moving laterally and decelerating. The lateral distance is significant, but the trajectory could intersect if the ego changes lanes.
   - **Risk**: **Medium Risk (3)** - Manageable with driver/system response.

5. **Obstacle 30766 (at 3.4s)**:
   - **Position**: (-108.5055, -166.9387)
   - **Velocity**: 7.0299 m/s
   - **Acceleration**: -2.1757 m/s²
   - **Lanelet**: 1164.0 (adjacent to ego's lanelet)
   - **Relative Motion**: The obstacle is moving laterally and decelerating. The lateral distance is significant, but the trajectory could intersect if the ego changes lanes.
   - **Risk**: **Medium Risk (3)** - Manageable with driver/system response.

6. **Obstacle 30767 (at 3.4s)**:
   - **Position**: (-106.9211, -163.5687)
   - **Velocity**: 9.9162 m/s
   - **Acceleration**: -1.8816 m/s²
   - **Lanelet**: 1163.0 (adjacent to ego's lanelet)
   - **Relative Motion**: The obstacle is moving laterally and decelerating. The lateral distance is significant, but the trajectory could intersect if the ego changes lanes.
   - **Risk**: **Medium Risk (3)** - Manageable with driver/system response.
