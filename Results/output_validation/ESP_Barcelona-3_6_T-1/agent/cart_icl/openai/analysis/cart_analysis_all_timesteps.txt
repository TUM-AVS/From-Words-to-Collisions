### Analysis:

Let's analyze the scenario at the most recent timestep (3.4 seconds) and consider earlier steps for motion trends.

**Ego Vehicle (30769.0)**:
- Located in lanelet 3652, traveling with a velocity of 1.6422 m/s.
- Recently increased velocity slightly, showing potential acceleration but still comparatively slow.

**Obstacle Analysis**:
1. **Obstacle 30750.0**: 
   - Stationary at lanelet 1171.0.
   - No risk as it's neither moving nor in direct path.

2. **Obstacle 30754.0**:
   - Stationary at lanelet 1170.0.
   - No risk as it's static and not in ego's current pathway.

3. **Obstacle 30755.0**:
   - Stationary at lanelet 1169.0.
   - No immediate threat due to its static nature and position.

4. **Obstacle 30757.0**:
   - Approached a halt at lanelet 1168.0; very low velocity.
   - Showed significant deceleration over time; poses no direct risk.

5. **Obstacle 30758.0**:
   - Slow movement with velocity reducing; far from ego's path.
   - Currently in lanelet 3651.0, low risk due to significant lateral distance.

6. **Obstacle 30762.0**:
   - In lanelet 3651.0, with significant slowdown.
   - Risk assessment shows low threat due to its position relative to ego.

7. **Obstacle 30763.0**:
   - Situated in lanelet 3653.0.
   - Moving slower, given deceleration, but no direct collision risk observed.

8. **Obstacle 30764.0**:
   - In lanelet 1165.0, alongside ego.
   - Monitoring showed decreasing velocity and no immediate threat.

9. **Obstacle 30765.0**:
   - Located in lanelet 1166.0; reduced velocity.
   - Current positioning makes it a non-threat.

10. **Obstacle 30766.0**:
    - Located in lanelet 1164.0 moving further from ego path.
    - Slight deceleration trend, not an immediate threat.
    
11. **Obstacle 30767.0**:
    - Fastest at lanelet 1163.0, but constant deceleration.
    - No immediate collision path with ego vehicle.

### Risk Ranking:

- There is no **Collision Risk (0)** or **Extreme Risk (1)** detected upon careful reviewing of the trajectory, distance, and inertial trends of all obstacles in relation to the ego vehicle's pathway.

Given the distance and deceleration trends regularly presented by the obstacles, no entities are approaching collision or extreme risk levels.
