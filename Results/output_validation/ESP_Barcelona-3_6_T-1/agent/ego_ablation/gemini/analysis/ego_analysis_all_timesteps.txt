At timestamp 3.4 seconds, the ego vehicle faces a complex scenario with multiple obstacles at varying risk levels. Obstacle 30764 poses the most significant threat due to its close proximity behind the ego vehicle (-0.87m longitudinally) and high closing velocity (5.18 m/s). This results in a very short TTC, placing it in the Extreme Risk category. Obstacle 30765, while further away, also represents a High Risk due to its closing velocity and moderate proximity. Other obstacles are further away and have more time to react to, therefore they are not in the collision, extreme or high risk categories.
