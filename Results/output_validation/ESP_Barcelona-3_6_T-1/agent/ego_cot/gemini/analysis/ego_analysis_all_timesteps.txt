### Safety analysis for timestep 3.4s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

**Assumptions and Calculations:**

* **Adjusted Distance:**  Since no vehicle sizes are provided, I'm assuming both ego and obstacle vehicles have a length of 4 meters and a width of 2 meters. For simplicity, I will approximate the adjusted longitudinal and lateral distances by subtracting half the respective vehicle dimension from the provided absolute distances.  `adjusted_d_long =  d_long - 2` and `adjusted_d_lat = d_lat - 1`.
* **TTC:**  TTC is calculated as `TTC = adjusted_d / v_rel`. If `v_rel` is positive (obstacle moving away), TTC is considered infinite (no risk). If any distance is negative, it must be brought to 0 or nearly 0 first before the relevant TTC can be calculated.
* **MDC:**  MDC is the minimum adjusted distance observed throughout the provided timesteps (2.5s to 3.4s), accounting for changes in both longitudinal and lateral distances.
