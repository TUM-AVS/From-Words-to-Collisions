Let me analyze the obstacles at the most recent timestep (3.4 seconds) and assess collision risks:

1. Obstacle 30750 (Front-right):
- Longitudinal distance: 19.30m (closing at -1.64m/s)
- Lateral distance: -1.90m (stable)
- TTC: 19.30/1.64 = 11.77s (No Risk)
- MDC: 1.90m (Medium Risk)
- Overall: Risk 3 (Medium)

2. Obstacle 30754 (Front):
- Longitudinal distance: 19.33m (closing at -1.64m/s)
- Lateral distance: 0.00m (same lane)
- TTC: 19.33/1.64 = 11.79s (No Risk)
- MDC: 19.33m (No Risk)
- Overall: Risk 5 (No Risk)

3. Obstacle 30755 (Front-left):
- Similar to 30750 - Risk 3 (Medium)

4. Obstacle 30757 (Front-left):
- Longitudinal distance: 19.38m (closing at -1.64m/s)
- Lateral distance: 5.38m (stable)
- TTC: 19.38/1.64 = 11.82s (No Risk)
- MDC: 5.38m (Low Risk)
- Overall: Risk 4 (Low)

5. Obstacle 30758 (Front-left):
- Longitudinal distance: 11.67m (closing at -1.46m/s)
- Lateral distance: 1.89m (closing)
- TTC (long): 11.67/1.46 = 7.99s (No Risk)
- TTC (lat): 1.89/0.00 = ∞ (No Risk)
- MDC: 1.89m (Medium Risk)
- Overall: Risk 3 (Medium)

6. Obstacle 30762 (Left):
- Longitudinal distance: 0.00m (aligned)
- Lateral distance: 1.89m (closing)
- TTC (lat): 1.89/0.00 = ∞ (No Risk)
- MDC: 1.89m (Medium Risk)
- Overall: Risk 3 (Medium)

7. Obstacle 30763 (Front-right):
- Longitudinal distance: 6.78m (moving away at 2.05m/s)
- Lateral distance: -1.89m (closing)
- TTC (lat): 1.89/0.00 = ∞ (No Risk)
- MDC: 1.89m (Medium Risk)
- Overall: Risk 3 (Medium)

8. Obstacle 30764 (Behind):
- Longitudinal distance: -0.87m (closing at 5.18m/s)
- Lateral distance: 0.00m (same lane)
- TTC: 0.87/5.18 = 0.17s (Extreme Risk)
- MDC: 0.87m (High Risk)
- Overall: Risk 1 (Extreme)

9. Obstacle 30765 (Rear-right):
- Longitudinal distance: -4.49m (closing at 6.23m/s)
- Lateral distance: -1.89m (moving away)
- TTC: 4.49/6.23 = 0.72s (High Risk)
- MDC: 1.89m (Medium Risk)
- Overall: Risk 2 (High)

10. Obstacle 30766 (Rear-left):
- Similar to 30765 - Risk 2 (High)

11. Obstacle 30767 (Rear-left):
- Longitudinal distance: -11.91m (closing at 8.27m/s)
- Lateral distance: 5.39m (closing)
- TTC: 11.91/8.27 = 1.44s (Medium Risk)
- MDC: 5.39m (Low Risk)
- Overall: Risk 3 (Medium)

Most critical observations:
- Obstacle 30764 is approaching from behind in the same lane with extremely low TTC (0.17s)
- Obstacle 30765 is also approaching from behind with high risk
- No current collision (Risk 0) but imminent extreme risk from 30764
