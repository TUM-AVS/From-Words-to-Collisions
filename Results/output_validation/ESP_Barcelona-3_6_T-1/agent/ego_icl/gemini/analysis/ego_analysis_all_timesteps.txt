At t=3.4s:

* **Obstacle 30750 (Front-right):**  Longitudinal distance is 19.30m and lateral distance is -1.90m. Relative longitudinal velocity is -1.64 m/s (approaching). The obstacle is moving towards the ego vehicle longitudinally but is relatively far.  Lateral movement is negligible. Risk assessment: Low (4).

* **Obstacle 30754 (Front):** Longitudinal distance is 19.33m, lateral distance is 0.00m. Relative longitudinal velocity is -1.64 m/s (approaching). Although laterally aligned, the longitudinal distance is significant.  Risk assessment: Low (4).

* **Obstacle 30755 (Front-left):** Longitudinal distance is 19.35m and lateral distance is 1.88m. Relative longitudinal velocity is -1.64 m/s (approaching). The obstacle is moving towards the ego vehicle longitudinally but is relatively far. Lateral movement is negligible. Risk assessment: Low (4).

* **Obstacle 30757 (Front-left):** Longitudinal distance is 19.38m and lateral distance is 5.38m.  Relative longitudinal velocity is -1.64 m/s (approaching) and lateral velocity is 0.00m. The obstacle is far and not a significant risk currently. Risk assessment: Negligible (5).

* **Obstacle 30758 (Front-left):** Longitudinal distance is 11.67m and lateral distance is 1.89m. Relative longitudinal velocity is -1.46 m/s (approaching). Lateral velocity is negligible, but longitudinal closing velocity exists. Risk assessment: Medium (3).

* **Obstacle 30762 (Left):** Longitudinal distance is 0.00m and lateral distance is 1.89m.  Relative longitudinal velocity is 2.80m/s (moving away) and the lateral relative velocity is -0.00m/s. The obstacle is directly beside the ego vehicle.  Although longitudinally aligned, the obstacle is moving away longitudinally, meaning that a collision is unlikely. Risk assessment: Medium (3).

* **Obstacle 30763 (Front-right):** Longitudinal distance is 6.78m and lateral distance is -1.89m. Relative longitudinal velocity is 2.05 m/s (moving away). Despite the negative lateral distance, the obstacle is moving away longitudinally, reducing risk. Risk assessment: Low (4).


* **Obstacle 30764 (Behind):** Longitudinal distance is -0.87m and lateral distance is 0.00m.  Relative longitudinal velocity is 5.18 m/s (approaching). This obstacle is very close behind and rapidly approaching in the same lane.  Risk assessment: Extreme (1).

* **Obstacle 30765 (Rear-right):** Longitudinal distance is -4.49m and lateral distance is -1.89m. Relative longitudinal velocity is 6.23 m/s (approaching). Although behind, the obstacle is approaching at high speed, posing some risk. Risk assessment: Low (4).

* **Obstacle 30766 (Rear-left):** Longitudinal distance is -10.63m and lateral distance is 1.89m. Relative longitudinal velocity is 5.39 m/s (approaching).  The obstacle is approaching from behind at a moderate distance. Risk assessment: Low (4).

* **Obstacle 30767 (Rear-left):** Longitudinal distance is -11.91m and lateral distance is 5.39m. Relative longitudinal velocity is 8.27 m/s (approaching).  The obstacle is approaching from behind but is relatively far. Risk assessment: Low (4).
