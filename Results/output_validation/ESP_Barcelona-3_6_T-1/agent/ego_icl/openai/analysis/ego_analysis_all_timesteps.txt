### Obstacle-by-Obstacle Analysis

#### Obstacle 30750
- **Position and Motion**
  - Front-right with adjusted distances: longitudinal 19.30m, lateral -1.90m
  - Relative velocity: longitudinal -1.64 m/s, lateral 0.00 m/s
  - The obstacle is driving toward the ego car longitudinally.

- **Trajectory Analysis**
  - Over timesteps, the distance is gradually decreasing, indicating a slow approach.
  - No lateral motion observed.

- **TTC and MDC Calculations**
  - **TTC (Longitudinal)** = 19.30m / 1.64 m/s ≈ 11.77s
  - **MDC (Longitudinal)**: Remains well over 1.0m as both distances are above 5.0m.
  - Given the high TTC and MDC, Risk Score: 5 (Negligible Risk)

#### Obstacle 30754
- **Position and Motion**
  - Front with adjusted distances: longitudinal 19.33m, lateral 0.00m
  - Relative velocity: longitudinal -1.64 m/s, lateral 0.00 m/s

- **Trajectory Analysis**
  - Steady decrease in distance suggests the obstacle is approaching, but at a slow rate.

- **TTC and MDC Calculations**
  - **TTC (Longitudinal)** = 19.33m / 1.64 m/s ≈ 11.79s
  - **MDC (Longitudinal)**: Well beyond immediate risk as both distances are relatively large.
  - Risk Score: 5 (Negligible Risk)

  - Risk Score: 5 (Negligible Risk)

#### Obstacle 30762
- **Position and Motion**
  - Left with adjusted distances: longitudinal 0.00m, lateral 1.89m
  - Relative velocity: longitudinal 2.80 m/s, negligible lateral motion
  - Moving towards the ego car.

- **Trajectory Analysis**
  - Approaching laterally with indications of being in the same lane.

- **TTC and MDC Calculations**
  - **TTC (Lateral)** and **MDC (Lateral)** not a concern due to stable positions.
  - Risk Score: 5 (Negligible Risk)

#### Obstacle 30763
- **Position and Motion**
  - Front-right with adjusted distances: longitudinal 6.78m, lateral -1.89m
  - Relative velocity: longitudinal 2.05 m/s, driving away longitudinally

- **Trajectory Analysis**
  - Increasing longitudinal distance confirms a separation from the ego vehicle.

- **TTC and MDC Calculations**
  - **TTC (Longitudinal)**: Not applicable, obstacle is moving away.
  - Risk Score: 5 (Negligible Risk)

#### Obstacle 30764
- **Position and Motion**
  - Behind with adjusted distances: longitudinal -0.87m, lateral 0.00m
  - Relative velocity: longitudinal 5.18 m/s, exact longitudinal alignment

- **Trajectory Analysis**
  - Steadily closing distance longitudinally.

- **TTC and MDC Calculations**
  - **TTC (Longitudinal)** = |0.87m / 5.18 m/s| ≈ 0.17s
  - **MDC**: Imminent risk as longitudinal distance is near-zero with closing velocity.
  - Risk Score: 1 (Extreme Risk)

#### Obstacle 30765
- **Position and Motion**
  - Rear-right with adjusted distances: longitudinal -4.49m, lateral -1.89m
  - Relative velocity: longitudinal 6.23 m/s

- **Trajectory Analysis**
  - Approaching from behind, closing in fast.

- **TTC and MDC Calculations**
  - **TTC (Longitudinal)** = |4.49m / 6.23 m/s| ≈ 0.72s
  - **MDC**: Significant narrowing of trajectory, posing a risk.
  - Risk Score: 2 (High Risk)

#### Obstacle 30766
- **Position and Motion**
  - Rear-left with adjusted distances: longitudinal -10.63m, lateral 1.89m
  - Relative velocity: longitudinal 5.39 m/s

- **Trajectory Analysis**
  - Approaching from rear-left, but positioned farther away.

- **TTC and MDC Calculations**
  - **TTC (Longitudinal)** = |10.63m / 5.39 m/s| ≈ 1.97s
  - Risk Score: 3 (Medium Risk)
