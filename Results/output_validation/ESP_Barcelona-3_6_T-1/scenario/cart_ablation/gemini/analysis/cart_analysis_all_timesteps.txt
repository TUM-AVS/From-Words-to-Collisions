At t=3.6s, the ego vehicle at (-100.1182, -180.3965) in lanelet 3652 is assessed for collisions with nearby obstacles.

Obstacle 30764 at (-103.2077, -177.2758) in lanelet 1165 poses a possible risk.  While not extremely close at this moment, the trajectories over the past 0.8 seconds show both the ego and obstacle approaching each other. The ego's acceleration fluctuates, while obstacle 30764 decelerates but remains at a higher velocity (6.3971) than the ego (1.9612). Their combined closing velocity and the ego's unpredictable acceleration raise concerns about a potential collision. Although additional information about lanelet geometry and ego's intended behavior would refine the assessment, based on available data, a medium risk rating (3) is assigned.

Obstacle 30765 at (-108.0995, -177.3081) in lanelet 1166 also warrants attention.  Although farther away laterally than 30764, its proximity, high velocity (7.4499 vs ego's 1.9612), and its continuous deceleration over the past second indicate a potential future conflict. Its proximity and closing speed suggest this warrants a medium risk rating (3).

Other obstacles are deemed low risk (4 or 5) because they are significantly distant, static, or moving in divergent directions.
