At t=3.6s, the ego vehicle (30769.0) is in lanelet 3652.0 with a velocity of 1.96 m/s.  Obstacle 30764.0 is also in lanelet 1165.0, but further ahead and decelerating. Given the ego vehicle's lane change into 3652, the risk of collision with 30764.0 has decreased and is no longer considered extreme. Other obstacles are in different lanelets and pose no immediate threat.
