- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3
- Obstacle ID: 30766.0
- Distance Risk reason: Relatively far from ego and in a different lane.  Poses no immediate threat based on historical data and current position.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Moving relatively fast, but direction and lane placement from history suggest low risk.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4
- Obstacle ID: 30767.0
- Distance Risk reason: Furthest obstacle and in a different lane. No risk based on historical data and current position.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Very fast-moving, but its trajectory from historical data suggests no immediate risk.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. **Most critical obstacles:** 30762.0, 30764.0, 30765.0 are the most critical due to their proximity and relative velocities to the ego vehicle. 30762.0 especially is important since it is moving closer to ego's lane.

2. **Trajectory analysis:** Over the 10 timesteps, the ego vehicle is moving slowly and decelerating within lanelet 3652. 30764 is consistently ahead of the ego vehicle in the same lane and moving away. 30765.0 remains in its adjacent lane, and 30762.0, while closing the distance to the ego vehicle, decelerates over time. 30757.0 is decelerating and coming close to zero velocity.

3. **Relative position, velocity, and acceleration:** The ego vehicle's slow speed and deceleration reduce the collision risk. The other critical obstacles are maintaining their lanes and exhibit decelerating behavior, further mitigating the risk.

4. **Collision determination:** No collision has occurred or appears imminent based on the provided data.

5. **Reasoning:** Though some obstacles are relatively close, their trajectories, relative velocities, and decelerations suggest that they are not on a direct collision course with the ego vehicle. The overall scenario indicates a low risk of collision.



### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
    "CollisionObstacles": null,
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null,
    "ScenarioAnalysis": {
        "IsCollisionScenario": false,
        "Reasoning": "Although some obstacles are in relative proximity to the ego vehicle, analysis of their trajectories, velocities, and decelerations over the provided timesteps indicates no immediate collision risk.  All obstacles are either moving away from the ego vehicle, decelerating, or maintaining safe distances in different lanes.  Therefore, the scenario is not classified as a collision scenario."
