### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. No obstacles are in immediate collision course with the ego vehicle.
2. All obstacles are either static or moving away from the ego vehicle.
3. The closest obstacles (30762-30767) are moving towards the ego but are still at a safe distance and decelerating.
4. The ego vehicle is accelerating, which helps maintain safe distances.
5. No extreme risk or collision scenarios are present.
