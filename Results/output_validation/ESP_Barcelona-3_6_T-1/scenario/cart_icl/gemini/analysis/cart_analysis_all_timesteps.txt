### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
No obstacles pose an immediate collision risk. The ego vehicle is maintaining a safe distance from other obstacles or is moving away from them.  Obstacle 30764 is in the same lanelet but decelerating ahead of the ego vehicle. Other obstacles are in different lanelets and are either stationary or moving away.
