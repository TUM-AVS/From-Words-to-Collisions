- **Time Risk Reason**: Low velocity and slight deceleration show minimal risk over time.
- **Time Safety Score**: 4
- **Overall Risk Score**: 4

#### Obstacle ID: 30762.0
- **Distance Risk Reason**: Has a higher velocity but is significantly ahead and moving away from the ego vehicle.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 4
- **Time Risk Reason**: It is moving away, reducing time risk concerns.
- **Time Safety Score**: 4
- **Overall Risk Score**: 4

#### Obstacle ID: 30763.0
- **Distance Risk Reason**: Travels within a different trajectory, moving laterally away.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 4
- **Time Risk Reason**: Trends show it gradually distancing in velocity, minimizing risk.
- **Time Safety Score**: 4
- **Overall Risk Score**: 4

#### Obstacle ID: 30764.0
- **Distance Risk Reason**: Relatively high velocity but heads in a divergent trajectory relative to ego, thus not posing an imminent threat.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 4
- **Time Risk Reason**: Speed maintains but not directed to the ego’s path, limiting time-based risks.
- **Time Safety Score**: 4
- **Overall Risk Score**: 4

#### Obstacle ID: 30765.0
- **Distance Risk Reason**: Positioned ahead of the ego vehicle, on a divergent path but high velocity.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 4
- **Time Risk Reason**: Velocity and direction away reduce potential future risks.
- **Time Safety Score**: 4
- **Overall Risk Score**: 4

#### Obstacle ID: 30766.0
- **Distance Risk Reason**: Ahead and not intercepting ego’s future trajectory, velocity indicates no impending risks.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 4
- **Time Risk Reason**: Decreasing acceleration trend aids to minimize risk levels.
- **Time Safety Score**: 4
- **Overall Risk Score**: 4

#### Obstacle ID: 30767.0
- **Distance Risk Reason**: High velocity, positioned away from the ego path, ensuring safe distancing.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 4
- **Time Risk Reason**: Accelerating away; minor risks due to broader trajectory shifts.
- **Time Safety Score**: 4
- **Overall Risk Score**: 4

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
Upon reviewing the recent velocities, positions, and accelerations, it's deduced that no obstacle presents immediate collision or extreme risk. All stationary obstacles are sufficiently distanced, and those in motion diverge from the ego path safely. Hence, no immediate collision likelihood exists.
