### Safety analysis for timestep 3.6s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

**Assumptions and Clarifications:**

* Since "adjusted distances" are not provided in the scenario context, the provided real distances (DTClong, DTClat) will be used for this analysis.  This is suboptimal, as vehicle size isn't accounted for.  **To improve the accuracy of this analysis, please provide the adjusted distances.**
* TTC will be approximated based on the provided velocity and acceleration.  Given the constant updates, a simplified calculation will be used: `TTC = Distance / Relative Velocity`. A more precise calculation would incorporate relative acceleration.  Furthermore, a negative relative velocity indicates the objects are moving closer. Negative TTC values indicate the time the collision happened in the past based on constant velocity which is not the case, so we'll consider them as a high risk of collision.
* No ego vehicle dimensions are provided, making precise collision determination difficult.
* "Collision" in the context data seems to represent situations where the obstacle overlaps with the ego vehicle's position, rather than necessarily an actual collision.
* Lateral motion is not considered in the TTC calculation, which may lead to conservative results. Lateral risk is assessed based on distance, assuming the car's width is smaller than the distance.
