* **Obstacle 30750 (Front-right):**  Trajectory analysis shows this obstacle approaching longitudinally but maintaining lateral separation. At 3.6s, longitudinal distance is 18.97m, lateral distance -1.89m, and longitudinal relative velocity is -1.96 m/s. TTC (longitudinal) = 18.97 / 1.96 ≈ 9.68s.  MDC is determined primarily by the lateral distance of -1.89m, thus categorizing this as a Medium Risk (3).

* **Obstacle 30754 (Front):**  This obstacle is directly ahead and approaching. At 3.6s, longitudinal distance is 19.00m, lateral distance 0.00m, and longitudinal relative velocity is -1.96 m/s. TTC (longitudinal) = 19.00 / 1.96 ≈ 9.69s. The lateral alignment suggests they are in the same lane, but the longitudinal distance is significant.  MDC is primarily based on the longitudinal distance, and with a safe TTC, risk is assessed as No Risk (5).

* **Obstacle 30755 (Front-left):** Similar trajectory to 30750, maintaining lateral separation.  At 3.6s, longitudinal distance is 19.02m, lateral distance 1.89m, and longitudinal relative velocity is -1.96 m/s. TTC (longitudinal) = 19.02 / 1.96 ≈ 9.7s.  MDC is based on the lateral distance of 1.89m, and risk is No Risk (5).

* **Obstacle 30757 (Front-left):** At 3.6s, longitudinal distance is 19.04m, lateral distance 5.38m, and longitudinal relative velocity is -1.96 m/s. TTC (longitudinal) = 19.04 / 1.96 ≈ 9.71s. MDC is greater than 5.38m indicating No Risk (5).

* **Obstacle 30758 (Front-left):**  At 3.6s, longitudinal distance is 11.37m, lateral distance 1.89m, and longitudinal relative velocity is -1.81 m/s. TTC (longitudinal) = 11.37 / 1.81 ≈ 6.28s. MDC is primarily based on the lateral distance of 1.89m classifying it as a No Risk (5).

* **Obstacle 30762 (Left):**  This obstacle maintains lateral separation.  At 3.6s, longitudinal distance is 0.00m, lateral distance 1.89m, and lateral relative velocity is -0.00 m/s, longitudinal relative velocity is 2.07 m/s. TTC is not applicable in the lateral direction due to zero relative velocity. MDC is based on the lateral distance of 1.89m classifying it as a Medium Risk (3).

* **Obstacle 30763 (Front-right):** This obstacle is moving away longitudinally but slightly towards the ego laterally.  At 3.6s, longitudinal distance is 7.14m, lateral distance -1.89m, longitudinal relative velocity is 1.38 m/s.  TTC (longitudinal) = 7.14 / 1.38 ≈ 5.17s.  MDC is determined by the lateral distance of -1.89m, and risk is Low Risk (4).


* **Obstacle 30764 (Behind/Collision):**  This obstacle has collided with the ego vehicle. At 3.6s, both longitudinal and lateral distances are 0.00m, indicating a collision. Risk level is Collision (0).

* **Obstacle 30765 (Rear-right):**  At 3.6s, longitudinal distance is -3.30m, lateral distance -1.89m, and longitudinal relative velocity is 5.49 m/s. TTC (longitudinal) = 3.30 / 5.49 ≈ 0.60s. MDC is less than 3.30m and close to 1.89m classifying it as a High Risk (2).

* **Obstacle 30766 (Rear-left):** At 3.6s, longitudinal distance is -9.60m, lateral distance 1.89m, and longitudinal relative velocity is 4.66 m/s. TTC (longitudinal) = 9.6 / 4.66 ≈ 2.06s. MDC is larger than 1.89m and thus at least a Medium Risk (3).


* **Obstacle 30767 (Rear-left):**  At 3.6s, longitudinal distance is -10.32m, lateral distance 5.39m, and longitudinal relative velocity is 7.46 m/s. TTC (longitudinal) = 10.32 / 7.46 ≈ 1.38s. MDC is greater than 5.39 classifying this obstacle as a No Risk (5).

**Conclusion:** Obstacle 30764 has collided with the ego vehicle. This is clearly a collision scenario.
