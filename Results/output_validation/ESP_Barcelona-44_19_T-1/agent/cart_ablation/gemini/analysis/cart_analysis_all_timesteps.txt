Here's the collision risk analysis:

**Ego Vehicle (30746.0):**  The ego vehicle maintains a consistent velocity and acceleration within lanelet 1665.0.

**Obstacle 30743.0:** This obstacle is in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle (1665.0) and its velocity is increasing while getting closer to the ego vehicle.  Its trajectory suggests an increasing risk of collision with the ego vehicle. At t=2.3s, the obstacle's position is (364.6521, 201.1913), rapidly approaching the ego vehicle's position of (361.0802, 204.9456). This, combined with the increasing velocity difference, makes a future collision likely if the behavior continues, so at t=2.3s, the risk level for this obstacle should be a 1.

**Obstacle 30747.0:** This obstacle is in a different lanelet and moving away from the ego vehicle.  Risk score: 5.

**Obstacle 30748.0:** Although its velocity and acceleration fluctuate, its distance and different lanelet from the ego vehicle make the risk minimal. Risk score: 4.

**Obstacle 30749.0:**  Data only exists for this obstacle at time 1.4s. Not enough information to assess properly so we consider the obstacle not a risk. Risk Score: 5

**Obstacle 30750.0:** While initially close and in a different lane, it moves further away. Risk score: 4.

**Obstacle 30754.0:** In a different lanelet and poses no immediate threat. Risk score: 5.

**Obstacle 30758.0:** Different lanelet, but worth monitoring due to increasing velocity. Risk score: 3.

**Obstacle 30760.0:** Initially further away, but its trajectory indicates movement in a different lane.  Risk score: 4.

**Obstacle 30762.0:**  Similar to 30760.0, different lane and further away but moving with higher velocity. Risk score: 3.

**Obstacle 30770.0:**  Different lane and moves further from the ego vehicle. Risk score 4.

**Obstacle 30767.0:** Different lane and moves further from the ego vehicle. Risk score 4.
