Obstacle 30743 is in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle and its position is getting closer to the ego vehicle over time.  The velocity and acceleration of this obstacle are also increasing, making a collision likely if this trend continues. This obstacle represents a **High Risk (2)**.

Obstacle 30747 is in a different lanelet and initially poses no risk. However, its trajectory and high speed suggest it might be cutting across the ego vehicle's path in the future, warranting monitoring but not immediate action. This obstacle represents a **Medium Risk (3)**.

Obstacle 30748 is in a different lanelet and its trajectory does not intersect with the ego vehicle's path, posing no immediate risk. This obstacle represents a **Low Risk (4)**.

Obstacle 30749 does not appear in the later timesteps, suggesting it has left the scene or the sensor range. Therefore it is a **Negligible Risk (5)**.


Obstacle 30750 is in a different lanelet and does not pose a direct risk of collision. It is a **Low Risk (4)**.

Obstacle 30754 is in a different lanelet and its trajectory doesn't intersect with the ego vehicle's path. It is a **Low Risk (4)**.

Obstacles 30758, 30760, 30762, and 30770 are all in different lanelets and moving away from the ego vehicle, posing no risk of collision. They all represent **Negligible Risk (5)**.

Obstacle 30767, appearing later in the scenario, is in a different lanelet and poses no risk.  It is a **Negligible Risk (5)**.
