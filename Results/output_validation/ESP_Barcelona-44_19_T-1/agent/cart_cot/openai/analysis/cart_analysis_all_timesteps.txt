Analyzing the most recent timestep at 2.3 seconds, the following insights were derived about the risk involved with each obstacle relative to the Ego vehicle:

1. **Obstacle 30743.0** (same lanelet as Ego):
   - This obstacle is moving alongside the Ego vehicle and has a velocity of 4.2976 which is higher than Ego's 1.1806. Given the similar trajectory and increasing separation, no immediate collision risk but potentially increasing risk if acceleration is maintained.

2. **Obstacle 30747.0**:
   - This obstacle is in a different lanelet and has consistent behavior maintaining its motion trend. The risk levels due to positional separation.

3. **Obstacle 30748.0**:
   - This obstacle is on a different lanelet and shows low velocity with increasing separation from the Ego, indicating low immediate risk.

4. **Obstacle 30750.0**:
   - Also located in a different lanelet with motion trends indicating it is not converging towards the Ego, maintaining low risk.

5. **Obstacle 30754.0**:
   - The consistent orientation and its lane separation from Ego indicate low risk.

6. **Obstacle 30760.0**:
   - Different lanelet and maintaining separation from the Ego with no immediate collision risk.

7. **Obstacle 30762.0**:
   - Although it has an intersecting potential with the Ego, it remains in a different lanelet enhancing separation slightly, reducing immediate risk.

8. **Obstacle 30767.0 and 30770.0**:
   - Despite their acceleration profiles indicating potential deceleration impacts, their lanelets and position dynamics indicate low immediate collision risk.

Conclusively, based on the velocity, distances, and separations from the Ego vehicle trajectory, there are no obstacles with risk levels 0 or 1 at the current moment in the analyzed dataset. Therefore, the evaluations result in no immediate or extreme collision threats.
