Let's analyze the scenario focused on the most recent timestep at 2.3 seconds:

1. **Ego Position**:
    - Position: (361.0802, 204.9456)
    - Velocity: 1.1806 m/s
    - Orientation: 2.3094 rad

2. **Obstacles** at 2.3 seconds:

- **30743.0**: Same lanelet, slight velocity increase to 4.2976 m/s, approaching Ego.
    - Distance to Ego: ~5.6 meters
    - Relative Orientation: Close
    - **TTC**: ~3.0 seconds
    - **Risk**: Medium (3), manageable with driver/system response.

- **30747.0**: Different lanelet, consistent velocity ~7.8763 m/s.
    - Distance to Ego: ~23 meters
    - **Risk**: Low (4), no immediate danger.

- **30748.0**: Different lanelet, velocity increasing to 3.0253 m/s.
    - Distance to Ego: ~15 meters
    - **Risk**: Low (4).

- **30750.0**: Different lanelet, velocity near Ego's speed, consistent acceleration.
    - Distance to Ego: ~15 meters
    - **Risk**: Low (4).

- **30754.0**: Different lanelet, slightly increasing speed.
    - Distance to Ego: ~25 meters
    - **Risk**: Negligible (5).

- **30758.0**: Not present in the latest data provided.

- **30760.0**: Different lanelet, away from Ego with an increasing velocity.
    - Exiting risk zone.
    - **Risk**: Negligible (5).

- **30762.0**: Different lanelet, moderate speed, not converging on Ego.
    - Distance to Ego: ~20 meters
    - **Risk**: Low (4).

- **30767.0** and **30770.0**: New entries, different lanelets.
    - No immediate threat to Ego found.
    - **Risk**: Low/Necessary for monitoring future interaction.

**Conclusion**:
- The closest risk factor is obstacle **30743.0**, which shares the lanelet and is gradually closing on the Ego but presents a manageable risk due to sufficient TTC.
