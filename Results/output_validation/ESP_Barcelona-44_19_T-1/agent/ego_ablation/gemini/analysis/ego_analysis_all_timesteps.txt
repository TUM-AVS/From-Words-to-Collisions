At timestamp 2.3 seconds, Obstacle 30743 poses the most significant risk. It is located directly behind the ego vehicle at a longitudinal distance of -0.67 meters, indicating a very close proximity.  The negative sign indicates it is behind the ego vehicle. Given its relative longitudinal velocity of 3.11 m/s towards the ego vehicle, a collision is imminent. Although the provided data lacks precise TTC calculation, the proximity and closing velocity strongly suggest an extremely high risk or an already occurred collision.

Other obstacles, while some exhibiting closing velocities, maintain safe distances and lateral displacements, constituting lower risks compared to Obstacle 30743. Obstacles like 30750 are longitudinally aligned (lateral distance of 17.32 m and at the same longitudinal position) but there is lateral separation.
