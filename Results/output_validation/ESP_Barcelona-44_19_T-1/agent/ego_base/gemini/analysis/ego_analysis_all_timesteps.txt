Obstacle 30743 is behind the ego vehicle and approaching rapidly, with a longitudinal distance of -0.67m and a relative longitudinal velocity of 3.11 m/s.  Given its proximity and speed, it represents a very high risk of collision. Risk score: 1 (Extreme Risk).

Obstacle 30747 is moving away longitudinally and poses no immediate threat. Risk score: 5 (Negligible Risk).

Obstacle 30748 is behind the ego and approaching, but at a slower rate than 30743 and with a greater distance. Risk score: 3 (Medium Risk).

Obstacle 30750 is directly beside the ego vehicle (Left).  While not an immediate collision risk, it requires careful monitoring. Risk score: 4 (Low Risk).

Obstacle 30754 is far behind and moving slowly towards the ego, presenting minimal risk. Risk score: 5 (Negligible Risk).

Obstacles 30760, 30762, 30767, and 30770 are all in front-right, moving away laterally but approaching longitudinally.  Of these, 30770 is closest but all have ample space and time to maneuver, posing no immediate risk. Risk scores: 5 (Negligible Risk).
