### Safety analysis for timestep 2.3s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

**Assumptions and Calculations:**

Since the provided scenario only includes real distances and not the adjusted distances (accounting for vehicle size), I will use the provided real distance as a proxy for the adjusted distance. However, in a real-world application, it is crucial to use the adjusted distances.  Additionally, I'll make assumptions for TTC calculations where necessary, prioritizing safety and assuming worst-case scenarios if relative velocity and acceleration information suggests an increasing risk of collision.

I will calculate Euclidean distance for proximity:  `distance = sqrt(DTClong^2 + DTClat^2)`. For simplicity, we use real distance as adjusted distance in our calculation.

For obstacles where the lateral or longitudinal velocity is towards the ego vehicle, I'll compute TTC using a simplified constant velocity approach: `TTC = distance / velocity`. In real-world scenarios, more sophisticated TTC calculation based on relative velocities and accelerations is necessary.
