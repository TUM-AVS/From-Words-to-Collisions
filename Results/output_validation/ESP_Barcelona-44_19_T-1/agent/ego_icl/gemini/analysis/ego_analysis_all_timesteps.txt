Obstacle 30743: This obstacle is behind the ego vehicle and approaching rapidly. The longitudinal distance has decreased from -2.74m to -0.67m in the last 0.9 seconds, and it's laterally aligned (0.00m). Given the high closing velocity of 3.11 m/s, a collision is imminent.
    * MDC: ~0.67m (using longitudinal distance as lateral is 0)
    * TTC: 0.67m / 3.11 m/s ≈ 0.22 seconds
    * Risk: 1 (Extreme Risk)

Obstacle 30747: This obstacle is behind and to the left of the ego vehicle. While it is moving away longitudinally, it's slightly approaching laterally. However, the lateral distance is substantial (15.54m), posing no immediate threat.
    * MDC: ~15.54m
    * TTC (lateral):  15.54m / 0.68 m/s ≈ 22.85 seconds
    * Risk: 5 (Negligible Risk)

Obstacle 30748: This obstacle is behind the ego vehicle and approaching, but slower than 30743. The longitudinal distance has decreased from -11.54m to -10.50m over 0.9 seconds, with lateral alignment.  The closing velocity is moderate (1.84 m/s).
    * MDC: ~10.50m
    * TTC: 10.50m / 1.84 m/s ≈ 5.7 seconds
    * Risk: 4 (Low risk)

Obstacle 30750: This obstacle is now directly beside (left of) the ego vehicle (longitudinal distance 0.00m), and has a lateral distance of 17.32m. While there is no longitudinal risk due to alignment and non-converging trajectory, there may be lateral risk.
    * MDC: ~17.32m
    * TTC (lateral): 17.32m / 0.84 m/s ≈ 20.6 seconds
    * Risk: 5 (Negligible Risk)

Obstacle 30754: This obstacle is far behind the ego and slowly approaching. Its trajectory doesn't indicate an immediate risk.
    * MDC: ~19.78m
    * TTC: 19.78m / 0.94 m/s ≈ 21 seconds
    * Risk: 5 (Negligible Risk)

Obstacle 30760: This obstacle is diagonally in front and to the right, with a decreasing lateral distance. Its trajectory suggests a possible future risk, though not imminent.
    * MDC: ~4.90m (lateral distance is the smallest and decreasing)
    * TTC (lateral): 4.90 m/9.58m/s = 0.51s
    * Risk: 4 (Low Risk)

Obstacle 30762: This obstacle is to the front-right and somewhat closer than 30760, with a decreasing lateral distance.  It poses a higher risk than 30760 but still low.
    * MDC: ~8.95m (lateral distance is smallest and decreasing)
    * TTC (lateral): 8.95 m/7.69 m/s = 1.16s
    * Risk: 4 (Low Risk)

Obstacle 30767: This obstacle is to the front-right and moderately far with a decreasing lateral distance. Its trajectory doesn't suggest an immediate risk.
    * MDC: ~18.75m (lateral distance is smallest and decreasing)
    * TTC (lateral): 18.75m / 3.15 m/s ≈ 5.95 seconds
    * Risk: 4 (Low Risk)

Obstacle 30770: This obstacle is to the front-right and moderately far, with a decreasing lateral distance. Its trajectory doesn't suggest an immediate risk.
    * MDC: ~19.10m (lateral distance is smallest and decreasing)
    * TTC (lateral): 19.10m / 3.11 m/s ≈ 6.14 seconds
    * Risk: 4 (Low Risk)
