Obstacle 30743 is in the same lane as the ego vehicle and its position is quite close.  Over the provided timesteps, its velocity increases significantly while closing the distance to the ego vehicle.  Although a collision isn't certain in the next instant, the rapidly decreasing distance and the increasing velocity difference create an extremely dangerous situation demanding immediate action.
