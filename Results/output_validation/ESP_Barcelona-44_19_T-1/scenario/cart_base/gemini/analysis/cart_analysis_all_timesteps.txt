Obstacle 30743 is in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle and is rapidly approaching from behind with a much higher velocity (4.75 m/s vs 1.18 m/s).  Given the relatively small difference in their x-coordinates (364.01 vs 360.92) and similar y-coordinates (201.84 vs 205.12), a collision is highly likely in the next few timesteps if the obstacle continues accelerating at its current rate (2.26 m/s^2). Obstacle 30748 is nearby and accelerating, but poses a lower risk due to its more lateral position. Other obstacles are in different lanelets and pose less immediate risk.
