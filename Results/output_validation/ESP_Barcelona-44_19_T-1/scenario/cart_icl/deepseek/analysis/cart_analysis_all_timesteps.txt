### Safety Analysis for the Most Recent Timestep (2.5 seconds)

#### Key Observations:
1. **Ego Vehicle**: Moving slowly (1.18 m/s) with minimal acceleration in lanelet 1665.
2. **Obstacle 30743**: In same lanelet (1665), approaching from behind with increasing speed (4.75 m/s) and positive acceleration. Distance ~3.09m.
3. **Other Obstacles**: Mostly in adjacent lanelets or moving away from ego's trajectory.

### Obstacle Analysis:

#### Obstacle 30743 (Same lanelet, approaching from behind)
- **Distance Risk**: Closing distance over time (from ~4.8m to ~3.09m). High proximity risk.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 2 (High Risk)
- **Time Risk**: TTC ~3.09/(4.75-1.18) â‰ˆ 0.87s (critical)
- **Time Safety Score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)
- **Overall Risk Score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)

#### Other Obstacles (e.g., 30744, 30745, etc.)
- All have distances >20m or divergent trajectories
- **Overall Risk Scores**: 4-5 (Low/Negligible Risk)

### Chain of Thought:
1. Only Obstacle 30743 shares the ego's lanelet and is closing distance rapidly.
2. TTC <1s indicates imminent danger, but no actual collision yet (distance >0).
3. All other obstacles are either stationary or moving away.
