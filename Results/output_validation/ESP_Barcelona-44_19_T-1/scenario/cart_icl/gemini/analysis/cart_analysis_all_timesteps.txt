### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep (2.5 seconds): Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 30743.0
- Distance Risk reason: In the same lanelet as ego and rapidly approaching from behind.  Positions over time show consistent closure.
- Distance safety score: 2
- Time Risk reason:  High relative velocity and positive acceleration indicate increasing risk over time.
- Time safety score: 2
- Overall Risk score: 2

- Obstacle ID: 30747.0
- Distance Risk reason:  Although in a different lanelet initially, its trajectory suggests a potential lane change and poses a risk to the ego vehicle.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason:  Moving relatively fast, but not directly toward ego. Lateral movement needs monitoring.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- Obstacle ID: 30748.0
- Distance Risk reason: In a different lanelet and maintaining lateral separation.  Trajectory analysis shows no immediate risk.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Moderate relative velocity and acceleration, but not on a collision course based on current data.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- Obstacle ID: 30750.0
- Distance Risk reason: Located in a different lanelet and moving away laterally.  No immediate risk observed.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: High velocity but moving away from ego. No immediate time-based risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 30754.0
- Distance Risk reason:  Different lanelet and maintaining separation. Poses no immediate threat based on current trajectory.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Low relative velocity and not on a direct collision course.  Minimal time-related risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 30760.0
- Distance Risk reason:  Different lanelet, no immediate risk.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason:  Moving quickly, but not towards ego.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 30762.0
- Distance Risk reason: Different lanelet, no immediate risk.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Moving quickly, but not towards ego.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 30767.0
- Distance Risk reason: Different lanelet, no immediate risk.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Moving relatively slowly, not towards ego.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 30770.0
- Distance Risk reason: Different lanelet, no immediate risk.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason:  Moving slowly, not towards ego.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
Obstacle 30743.0 exhibits concerning behavior due to its proximity, high relative velocity, and positive acceleration in the same lane. While not an immediate collision, the trend suggests a high probability of a collision if evasive action isn't taken. Other obstacles are not presenting an immediate collision risk at this timestep.  This is not a collision scenario yet but has high risk.
