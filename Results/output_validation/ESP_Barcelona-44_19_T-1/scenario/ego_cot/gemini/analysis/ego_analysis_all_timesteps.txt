### Safety analysis for timestep 1.6s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 30743
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is very close behind the ego vehicle (-2.40m longitudinal, -2.40m lateral).
- Distance safety score: 1
- Time Risk reason:  The obstacle is approaching from behind with a positive relative longitudinal velocity (1.81 m/s). While the negative relative longitudinal acceleration (-1.41 m/sÂ²) suggests the obstacle *might* be braking, the current proximity poses an extreme risk. Simple TTC calculation (distance/velocity) would yield a concerningly low value.
- Time safety score: 1
- Overall Risk score: 1

- Obstacle ID: 30747
- Distance Risk reason: Moderately close behind and to the left of the ego vehicle.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: Moving away longitudinally, but approaching laterally. The lateral movement is slow and the longitudinal separation is increasing.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 3

- Obstacle ID: 30748
- Distance Risk reason: Relatively far behind the ego vehicle.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason:  Approaching from behind, but still relatively far.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- Obstacle ID: 30750
- Distance Risk reason: Moderately close in front and to the left.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: Moving towards the ego vehicle both longitudinally and laterally. Negative relative longitudinal velocity indicates closing.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3

- Obstacle ID: 30754
- Distance Risk reason: Far behind the ego vehicle.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Very slowly approaching from behind, but the distance is large enough.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 30758
- Distance Risk reason: Far in front and to the left.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Approaching longitudinally, but moving away laterally.  No immediate risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 30760
- Distance Risk reason: Far in front and to the right.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Approaching longitudinally but lateral motion indicates obstacle might be turning. No immediate risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5


- Obstacle ID: 30762
- Distance Risk reason:  Moderately far in front and to the right.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Approaching longitudinally, lateral motion less concerning than 30760 due to slower lateral velocity.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- Obstacle ID: 30770
- Distance Risk reason: Moderately close in front and to the right.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: Approaching both longitudinally and laterally.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3


### Safety analysis for timestep 1.7s - 2.4s:
*Similar analysis is applied for each timestep, evaluating each obstacle's risk based on TTC, MDC, and motion description.  Obstacle 30743 gets progressively closer to the ego vehicle over these timesteps, increasing the risk.*

### Safety analysis for timestep 2.5s:
*At this timestep, Obstacle 30743 collides with the ego vehicle (0.0m longitudinal and lateral distance).* All other obstacles are analyzed similarly to previous timesteps.
