Let me analyze the most recent timestep (2.5 seconds) for collision risks:

Obstacle-by-obstacle analysis:

1. Obstacle 30743:
   - Position: Collision (longitudinal = 0.00m, lateral = 0.00m)
   - Relative velocity: 3.57 m/s (longitudinal), 0.04 m/s (lateral)
   - Motion: Exact alignment in both dimensions
   - Analysis: This is an actual collision occurring
   - Risk Score: 0 (Collision)

2. Obstacle 30747:
   - Position: Rear-left (longitudinal = -11.63m, lateral = 15.90m)
   - Relative velocity: -9.02 m/s (longitudinal, moving away), -0.42 m/s (lateral)
   - Motion: Moving away longitudinally, slowly approaching laterally
   - MDC: Lateral distance > 15m (No Risk)
   - Risk Score: 5 (No Risk)

3. Obstacle 30748:
   - Position: Behind (longitudinal = -10.09m, lateral = 0.00m)
   - Relative velocity: 2.24 m/s (longitudinal), 0.09 m/s (lateral)
   - Motion: Approaching from behind
   - TTC: 10.09/2.24 = 4.5s (Low Risk)
   - Risk Score: 4 (Low Risk)

4. Obstacle 30750:
   - Position: Left (longitudinal = 0.00m, lateral = 17.10m)
   - Relative velocity: -9.95 m/s (longitudinal), -0.60 m/s (lateral)
   - Motion: Side-by-side with large lateral distance
   - MDC: Lateral distance > 17m (No Risk)
   - Risk Score: 5 (No Risk)

5. Obstacle 30754:
   - Position: Behind (longitudinal = -19.58m, lateral = 0.00m)
   - Relative velocity: 1.22 m/s (longitudinal), 0.12 m/s (lateral)
   - Motion: Slowly approaching from behind
   - TTC: 19.58/1.22 = 16.0s (No Risk)
   - Risk Score: 5 (No Risk)

6. Obstacle 30760:
   - Position: Front-right (longitudinal = 19.15m, lateral = -3.70m)
   - Relative velocity: -0.45 m/s (longitudinal), 9.55 m/s (lateral)
   - Motion: Approaching laterally
   - TTC: 3.70/9.55 = 0.39s (Extreme Risk)
   - Risk Score: 1 (Extreme Risk)

7. Obstacle 30762:
   - Position: Front-right (longitudinal = 11.86m, lateral = -7.88m)
   - Relative velocity: -1.30 m/s (longitudinal), 7.98 m/s (lateral)
   - Motion: Approaching laterally
   - TTC: 7.88/7.98 = 0.99s (High Risk)
   - Risk Score: 2 (High Risk)

8. Obstacle 30767:
   - Position: Front-right (longitudinal = 15.54m, lateral = -18.85m)
   - Relative velocity: -1.22 m/s (longitudinal), 2.25 m/s (lateral)
   - Motion: Large lateral distance
   - TTC: 18.85/2.25 = 8.38s (No Risk)
   - Risk Score: 5 (No Risk)

9. Obstacle 30770:
   - Position: Front-right (longitudinal = 8.54m, lateral = -18.99m)
   - Relative velocity: -1.22 m/s (longitudinal), 2.26 m/s (lateral)
   - Motion: Large lateral distance
   - TTC: 18.99/2.26 = 8.40s (No Risk)
   - Risk Score: 5 (No Risk)

Trajectory Analysis:
- Obstacle 30743 shows clear collision at 2.5s (distance reaches 0.00m in both dimensions)
- Obstacle 30760 shows rapidly decreasing lateral distance with TTC < 0.5s
- Other obstacles either have large distances or diverging paths
