*Obstacle Analysis at t=2.5s*

**Obstacle 30743 (Behind):** This obstacle has been consistently approaching the ego vehicle from behind along the same lateral line (0.00m lateral distance throughout all timesteps).  At t=2.5s, the longitudinal distance is 0.00m, indicating a collision has occurred. The relative longitudinal velocity is positive (3.57 m/s), meaning the obstacle was still moving towards the ego at the moment of impact.

* Risk Score: 0 (Collision)

**Obstacle 30747 (Rear-Left):**  This obstacle is moving away longitudinally (-11.63m) but slightly towards the ego laterally. The lateral distance (15.90m) is significant, and the lateral velocity is small (-0.42m/s). There is no immediate risk.

* Risk Score: 5 (No Risk)

**Obstacle 30748 (Behind):**  Similar to Obstacle 30743, this obstacle approaches from behind and is laterally aligned. However, at t=2.5s, it's still -10.09m behind, posing no immediate collision risk.

* Risk Score: 5 (No Risk)

**Obstacle 30750 (Left):**  This obstacle maintains a nearly constant lateral distance (around 17m) while approaching longitudinally.  At t=2.5s, it reaches longitudinal alignment (0.00m), but given the substantial lateral separation, no collision occurs.

* Risk Score: 5 (No Risk)

**Obstacle 30754 (Behind):**  This obstacle consistently approaches from behind along the same lateral position.  It is still relatively far (-19.58m) at t=2.5s.

* Risk Score: 5 (No Risk)


**Obstacle 30760 (Front-Right):** This obstacle is approaching both longitudinally and laterally. The lateral distance is decreasing significantly.  At t=2.5s, the longitudinal distance is 19.15m and the lateral is -3.70m, showing no immediate risk.

* Risk Score: 5 (No Risk)

**Obstacle 30762 (Front-Right):** This obstacle also approaches both longitudinally and laterally. It is closer than 30760.  However, at t=2.5s, it poses no immediate collision risk, though worth monitoring. 

* Risk Score: 5 (No Risk)

**Obstacle 30767 (Front-Right):**  Approaching both longitudinally and laterally but still relatively far. No immediate risk at t=2.5s.

* Risk Score: 5 (No Risk)

**Obstacle 30770 (Front-Right):** Similar to 30767 but slightly closer. No immediate risk.

* Risk Score: 5 (No Risk)
