# Vehicle Safety Analysis Report

## Analysis of Obstacles at the Most Recent Timestep (2.5 seconds)

### Obstacle 30743
- **Position:** Collision with the ego vehicle
- **Adjusted Distances:** Longitudinal = 0.00 m, Lateral = 0.00 m
- **Relative Velocity:** Longitudinal = 3.57 m/s, Lateral = 0.04 m/s
- **Motion Description:** Exact longitudinal and lateral alignment
- **Analysis:** This obstacle is in direct collision with the ego vehicle as both longitudinal and lateral distances are 0 meters, with a relative velocity indicating direct approach towards the ego.
- **Risk Score:** 0 (Collision)

### Obstacle 30747
- **Position:** Rear-left of the ego vehicle
- **Adjusted Distances:** Longitudinal = -11.63 m, Lateral = 15.90 m
- **Relative Velocity:** Longitudinal = -9.02 m/s, Lateral = -0.42 m/s
- **Motion Description:** Moving away longitudinally and laterally
- **Analysis:** Obstacle is moving away in both dimensions, reducing any collision risk.
- **Risk Score:** 5 (No Risk)

### Obstacle 30748
- **Position:** Behind the ego car
- **Adjusted Distances:** Longitudinal = -10.09 m, Lateral = 0.00 m
- **Relative Velocity:** Longitudinal = 2.24 m/s, Lateral = 0.09 m/s
- **Motion Description:** Approaching from behind in the same lane
- **Analysis:** The obstacle's velocity indicates it is approaching from behind, but the distance is sufficient that the collision is not imminent. Future monitoring needed.
- **Risk Score:** 3 (Medium Risk)

### Obstacle 30750
- **Position:** Left of the ego vehicle
- **Adjusted Distances:** Longitudinal = 0.00 m, Lateral = 17.10 m
- **Relative Velocity:** Longitudinal = -9.95 m/s, Lateral = -0.60 m/s
- **Motion Description:** Driving towards the ego laterally
- **Analysis:** Though longitudinal alignment exists, the lateral distance remains large with minor closing velocity. Thus, unlikely to cause immediate concern.
- **Risk Score:** 5 (No Risk)

### Obstacle 30754
- **Position:** Behind the ego car
- **Adjusted Distances:** Longitudinal = -19.58 m, Lateral = 0.00 m
- **Relative Velocity:** Longitudinal = 1.22 m/s, Lateral = 0.12 m/s
- **Motion Description:** Approaching from behind in the same lane
- **Analysis:** Large distance coupled with slow closing velocity suggests limited risk within short time frame.
- **Risk Score:** 4 (Low Risk)

### Obstacle 30760
- **Position:** Front-right of the ego vehicle
- **Adjusted Distances:** Longitudinal = 19.15 m, Lateral = -3.70 m
- **Relative Velocity:** Longitudinal = -0.45 m/s, Lateral = 9.55 m/s
- **Motion Description:** Approaching laterally from the right
- **Analysis:** Fast lateral closing speed requires careful future monitoring although longitudinal distance prevents immediate collision.
- **Risk Score:** 3 (Medium Risk)

### Obstacle 30762
- **Position:** Front-right of the ego vehicle
- **Adjusted Distances:** Longitudinal = 11.86 m, Lateral = -7.88 m
- **Relative Velocity:** Longitudinal = -1.30 m/s, Lateral = 7.98 m/s
- **Motion Description:** Approaching laterally from the right
- **Analysis:** Sufficient distance with closing velocity indicates monitoring is needed but not immediate risk.
- **Risk Score:** 3 (Medium Risk)

### Obstacle 30767
- **Position:** Front-right of the ego vehicle
- **Adjusted Distances:** Longitudinal = 15.54 m, Lateral = -18.85 m
- **Relative Velocity:** Longitudinal = -1.22 m/s, Lateral = 2.25 m/s
- **Motion Description:** Approaching laterally from the right
- **Analysis:** Relatively slow lateral approach combined with reasonable distance suggests low collision risk.
- **Risk Score:** 4 (Low Risk)

### Obstacle 30770
- **Position:** Front-right of the ego vehicle
- **Adjusted Distances:** Longitudinal = 8.54 m, Lateral = -18.99 m
- **Relative Velocity:** Longitudinal = -1.22 m/s, Lateral = 2.26 m/s
- **Motion Description:** Approaching laterally from the right
- **Analysis:** Though approaching, distances and rates imply a very low risk.
- **Risk Score:** 4 (Low Risk)
