Here's the collision risk analysis:

**Obstacle 30743:** This obstacle is static for a majority of the scenario duration located far from the ego vehicle's trajectory. At 4.6 seconds, it starts moving with increasing velocity but remains far from the ego vehicle, posing negligible risk. Therefore, Risk Score: 5.

**Obstacle 30744:**  This obstacle maintains a safe lateral distance from the ego vehicle and shows almost constant velocity along its trajectory parallel to the ego vehicle. Although its lane changes from 1669.0 to null, it doesn't pose any immediate threat. Thus, Risk Score: 4.

**Obstacle 30757:** This obstacle, initially moving with a high velocity, gets closer to the ego vehicle over time. Even though there's no immediate collision in the given timeframe, the decreasing distance combined with fluctuations in acceleration warrants caution. Hence, Risk Score: 3.

**Obstacle 30760:** This obstacle's trajectory shows movement close to the ego vehicle, especially towards the end of the given timesteps. The continuous high velocity, along with acceleration toward the ego vehicle between seconds 4.4 and 4.8 warrants attention. However, by 5.1 seconds, the distance appears manageable given the ego vehicle slows down. Hence, Risk Score: 3.
