Obstacle 30743: Initially stationary and far from the ego vehicle, this obstacle starts moving at t=4.6s but remains at a safe distance and poses no immediate threat. Risk score: 4 (Low Risk)

Obstacle 30744: Moving away from the ego vehicle and poses no risk of collision. Risk score: 5 (Negligible Risk)

Obstacle 30757:  Initially approaching the ego vehicle with a higher velocity, this obstacle experiences significant negative acceleration (braking) in subsequent timesteps.  While the distance is decreasing, the braking suggests an attempt to avoid collision, reducing the immediate risk. Requires monitoring. Risk score: 3 (Medium Risk)

Obstacle 30760:  This obstacle is in the ego vehicle's vicinity and moving with a relatively high velocity. While the paths appear to be diverging slightly, the proximity and speed make this obstacle a potential concern.  Risk score: 3 (Medium Risk).  It is important to note that this obstacle ends up in the same lanelet (644) as the ego vehicle at t=4.5, further increasing the need for monitoring.
