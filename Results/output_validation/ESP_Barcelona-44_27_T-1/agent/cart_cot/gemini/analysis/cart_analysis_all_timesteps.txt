Obstacle 30760 shows a concerning trend. While not immediately colliding, its accelerating towards the ego vehicle and the distance is closing rapidly over each timestep.  This warrants a high risk assessment. Obstacle 30757 is moving with a high velocity but is also decelerating and its trajectory doesn't suggest an imminent collision. Obstacle 30743 although initially static, starts to accelerate towards the ego vehicle. However, given its distance and relatively low velocity it does not represent an immediate risk at this time. Obstacle 30744 maintains a safe distance and trajectory from the ego vehicle.
