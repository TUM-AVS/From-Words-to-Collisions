Here's the collision risk assessment and JSON output:

**Analysis of the Latest Timestep (5.1 seconds):**

* **Obstacle 30743:** This obstacle is moving slowly and laterally far from the ego vehicle, posing no immediate threat. Risk: 4 (Low).
* **Obstacle 30744:** This obstacle is not present in the last timestep.
* **Obstacle 30757:** This obstacle is moving in a different lanelet, and the lateral distance is significant.  While its longitudinal velocity is higher than the ego's, the current trajectories don't suggest an imminent collision. Risk: 3 (Medium).
* **Obstacle 30760:**  This obstacle is in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle and moving with a higher longitudinal velocity. We need to calculate TTC and MDC to assess the risk properly.  The data provided does not give exact relative positions needed for accurate TTC/MDC calculations.  However, the closing velocities and shared lanelet suggest a potential risk.  Based on the limited data, the risk is estimated to be between 2 (High) and 3 (Medium).  Additional information is needed to refine this assessment.
