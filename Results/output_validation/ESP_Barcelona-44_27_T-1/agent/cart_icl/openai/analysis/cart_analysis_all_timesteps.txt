### Analysis:

1. **Obstacle 30743:**
   - The obstacle remains mostly stationary across the timesteps and has minimal velocity. It is positioned some distance away from the ego vehicle, with no significant change in proximity or speed to indicate a risk of collision.
   - **Risk Level:** 5 (Negligible Risk)

2. **Obstacle 30744:**
   - This obstacle is moving consistently but remains oriented away from the ego vehicle. It doesn't pose an immediate threat since it is consistently on a different path.
   - **Risk Level:** 5 (Negligible Risk)

3. **Obstacle 30757:**
   - Originally following a path with high speed; however, it is consistently accelerating towards a deceleration trend. Nevertheless, the vehicle is moving away from the ego vehicle's trajectory, potentially  gaining lateral distance.
   - **Risk Level:** 4 (Low Risk)

4. **Obstacle 30760:**
   - Positioned close to the ego vehicle's trajectory; despite being in a separate lanelet at the last timestamp, the obstacle shares a similar orientation and could potentially cross into the ego vehicleâ€™s path. Its speed and acceleration may contribute to a risk of moving into the ego lane if not managed.
   - **TTC/MDC Analysis:** The distance is decreasing slightly due to lanelet similarity, but the lateral position may prevent a collision in the immediate future.
   - **Potential Risk:** Speed and closing distance suggest this could develop into a medium risk scenario without intervention.
   - **Risk Level:** 3 (Medium Risk)

### Conclusion:

No immediate risk of collision exists based on observations of spatial separation and trends. The risk levels are mitigated by lateral separation and existing speed dynamics. Obstacle 30760 is identified as a medium risk due to speed and trajectory considerations.
