At t=5.1s, Obstacle 30743 is located 2.1m in front and 24.63m to the left, moving towards the ego vehicle longitudinally at -4.28 m/s and laterally at -1.66 m/s.  Given its proximity (2.1m) and continuous approach, this obstacle poses a very high risk. Although the lateral motion slightly reduces direct collision probability, the longitudinal distance and velocity suggest a possible collision within the next second. Therefore, Obstacle 30743 represents an Extreme Risk (Overall Risk Score 1) because the MDC is around 2.1 meters and the TTC is likely less than 1 second.

Obstacle 30757, at 8.79m longitudinal and 2.64m lateral distance, is moving away from the ego vehicle both longitudinally (3.28 m/s) and laterally (0.35 m/s). This obstacle presents no immediate risk. Therefore, Obstacle 30757 has a Negligible Risk (Overall Risk Score 5).

Obstacle 30760 is behind the ego vehicle at -1.24m longitudinal distance and 0m lateral distance, closing in at 5.38 m/s. Although approaching rapidly, the obstacle is behind the ego vehicle, suggesting a rear-end collision scenario. At its current velocity and proximity, it might lead to a collision very soon. Therefore, considering the negative longitudinal distance, but the relatively slow velocity, Obstacle 30760 is currently a High Risk (Overall Risk Score 2) as the MDC is approximately 1.24m and TTC is likely around 0.5 second.
