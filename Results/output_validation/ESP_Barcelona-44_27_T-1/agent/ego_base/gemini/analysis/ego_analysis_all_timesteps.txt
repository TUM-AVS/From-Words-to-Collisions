At t=5.1s:
- **Obstacle 30743**: Located front-left (2.10m longitudinal, 24.63m lateral), approaching longitudinally (-4.28 m/s) and laterally (-1.66 m/s).  The longitudinal distance is very small, suggesting a high risk of collision. Risk score: 2.
- **Obstacle 30757**: Located front-left (8.79m longitudinal, 2.64m lateral), moving away longitudinally (3.28 m/s) and laterally (0.35 m/s). Poses no immediate risk. Risk score: 4.
- **Obstacle 30760**: Located behind (-1.24m longitudinal, 0.00m lateral), approaching longitudinally (5.38 m/s).  The negative longitudinal distance and relatively high velocity indicate that this obstacle is very close and rapidly approaching from behind. Risk score: 1.

Risk Levels:
0: Collision - Physical contact occurred or unavoidable
1: Extreme Risk - Immediate collision likely
2: High Risk - Close to collision, needs quick action
3: Medium Risk - Manageable with proper reaction
4: Low Risk - Minimal risk, sufficient time to react
5: Negligible Risk - No significant risk
