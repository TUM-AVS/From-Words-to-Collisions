### Safety analysis for timestep 5.1 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

**- Obstacle ID: 30743**
- Distance Risk reason:  Obstacle 30743 is located 2.10m longitudinally and 2.10m laterally in the front-left of the ego vehicle. Given its continuous approach longitudinally and laterally at -4.28 m/s and -1.66 m/s respectively, a high risk of collision exists.
- Distance safety score: 2 (High Risk)
- Time Risk reason: Given the short distance and the relative velocity, the TTC is very low, implying a high risk.  Without immediate evasive action, a collision is highly probable within the next second.
- Time safety score: 2 (High Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 2 (High Risk)

**- Obstacle ID: 30744**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 30744 is no longer present in the latest timestep. It was moving away laterally in previous timesteps and is now sufficiently far or out of sensor range to not pose a risk.
- Distance safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- Time Risk reason: As the obstacle is not detected, there's no associated TTC.
- Time safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 5 (Negligible Risk)


**- Obstacle ID: 30757**
- Distance Risk reason: Situated 8.79m longitudinally and 8.79m laterally in the front-left, this obstacle is moving away from the ego vehicle at 3.28 m/s longitudinally and 0.35 m/s laterally.
- Distance safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- Time Risk reason: The large distance and the separating motion indicate no risk of collision.
- Time safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 5 (Negligible Risk)

**- Obstacle ID: 30760**
- Distance Risk reason: This obstacle is located -1.24m longitudinally (behind) and -1.24m laterally (unknown) relative to the ego vehicle. It's approaching at 5.38 m/s longitudinally and 0.33 m/s laterally. The close proximity and rapid approach pose an extreme risk.
- Distance safety score: 1 (Extreme Risk)
- Time Risk reason: The very short distance and high closing speed lead to a very low TTC.
- Time safety score: 1 (Extreme Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 1 (Extreme Risk)
