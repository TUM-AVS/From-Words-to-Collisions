### Obstacle Analysis at 5.1 Seconds

#### Obstacle 30743 Analysis
- **Adjusted Distances**: Longitudinal = 2.10 m, Lateral = 24.63 m
- **Relative Velocities**: Longitudinal = -4.28 m/s, Lateral = -1.66 m/s
- **Motion Description**: Obstacle is driving toward the ego car longitudinally and laterally from the left.
  
**Trajectory and Risk Assessment:**
- **Trajectory**: The obstacle is approaching quickly from the front-left. Relative velocity indicates it's moving towards the ego both longitudinally and laterally.
- **TTC Longitudinal**: \( \text{TTC}_{\text{long}} = \frac{2.10}{4.28} \approx 0.49 \) seconds
- **TTC Lateral**: Not critical as lateral distance is large, focus instead on longitudinal dimension.
- **MDC**: With the current approach, the closest this obstacle can approach is 2.10 meters longitudinally.

**Risk Level**: 
- Given the TTC is less than 0.5 seconds longitudinally, this poses an extreme risk (1). 

#### Obstacle 30757 Analysis
- **Adjusted Distances**: Longitudinal = 8.79 m, Lateral = 2.64 m
- **Relative Velocities**: Longitudinal = 3.28 m/s, Lateral = 0.35 m/s
- **Motion Description**: Obstacle is moving away longitudinally from the ego car and laterally to the left.

**Trajectory and Risk Assessment:**
- **Trajectory**: This obstacle is diverging, moving away both longitudinally and laterally. 
- **TTC & MDC**: With increasing distances, TTC and MDC won't indicate an immediate risk.
  
**Risk Level**: 
- The analysis indicates no immediate risk as both distances are increasing. This is a negligible risk (5).

#### Obstacle 30760 Analysis
- **Adjusted Distances**: Longitudinal = -1.24 m, Lateral = 0.00 m (exact lateral alignment)
- **Relative Velocities**: Longitudinal = 5.38 m/s, Lateral = 0.33 m/s
- **Motion Description**: Obstacle is driving toward the ego car from behind with exact lateral alignment.

**Trajectory and Risk Assessment:**
- **Trajectory**: Approaching fast from behind.
- **TTC Longitudinal**: Not calculated as it indicates the time since passing or overtaking due to small negative distance.
- **MDC**: With the current trajectory, the potential contact or imminent close pass is extremely high.

**Risk Level**: 
- Relative velocity from behind with minimal distance implies imminent collision risk. This results in a collision risk (0).

```
This analysis indicates that Obstacle 30760 poses an immediate collision risk due to close longitudinal alignment and high closing velocity from behind. Obstacle 30743 poses an extreme risk due to a quick closing time forward, while Obstacle 30757 presents no immediate risk as it diverges.
