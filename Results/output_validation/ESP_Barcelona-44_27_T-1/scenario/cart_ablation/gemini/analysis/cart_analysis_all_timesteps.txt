At t=5.3s, Ego (30745.0) is at (349.2, 226.5) and obstacle 30760.0 is at (352.6, 229.7).  Obstacle 30760.0 is very close to Ego and on a converging trajectory based on past positions. The positions and the fact that they share the same lanelet (3235) suggest an extremely high risk of collision. Other obstacles are not an immediate concern at this timestep.

    "Reasoning": "Obstacle 30760.0 poses an extreme risk of collision with Ego due to close proximity and converging trajectories within the same lanelet (3235) at t=5.3s."
