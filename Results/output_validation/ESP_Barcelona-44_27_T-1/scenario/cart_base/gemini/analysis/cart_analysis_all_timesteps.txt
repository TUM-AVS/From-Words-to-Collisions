At t=5.3s, Ego (30745.0) is at (349.2, 226.5) in lanelet 3235.0.

* Obstacle 30760.0: Located at (352.6, 229.7) in lanelet 3235.0. This obstacle is in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle and very close in position.  Given the positions and the ego's decreasing velocity while this obstacle has increasing velocity, a collision is highly likely in the next timestep.  **Extreme Risk (1)**

* Obstacle 30757.0: Located at (341.9, 214.0) in lanelet 3240.0. While this obstacle shows a continuing velocity decrease and is in a different lanelet, the proximity and the rapidly changing dynamics require close monitoring.  The risk is elevated but not imminent based on current information. **Medium Risk (3)**

* Obstacle 30751.0: Located at (340.3, 198.8) in lanelet 3250.0. Low risk due to distance and different lanelet.

* Obstacle 30743.0: Located at (362.4, 203.5) in lanelet 1665.0. Low risk due to distance and different lanelet.
