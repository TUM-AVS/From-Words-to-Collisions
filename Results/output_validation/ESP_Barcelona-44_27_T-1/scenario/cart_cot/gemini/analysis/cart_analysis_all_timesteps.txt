### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 30743.0
- Distance Risk reason: This obstacle is far from the ego vehicle and its lateral movement doesn't pose an immediate threat.  While it has started moving, its velocity is still low.  Past positions indicate it was stationary for a while.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Although the obstacle is now moving, its velocity is relatively low and it is not on a direct collision course with the ego vehicle based on current trajectories.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- Obstacle ID: 30751.0
- Distance Risk reason: This obstacle is relatively far from the ego vehicle laterally and longitudinally at the latest timestep. Historical data shows it's approaching from behind and slightly to the side.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: The obstacle's velocity is high, and it appears to be moving closer to the ego vehicle based on the trajectory history. Requires monitoring.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3

- Obstacle ID: 30757.0
- Distance Risk reason:  While initially closer to the ego vehicle, this obstacle has consistently maintained a safe lateral distance over the observed time steps and is moving further away longitudinally.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Although this obstacle has a high velocity, it's decelerating and moving away from the ego vehicle.  The historical trajectory confirms this trend.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- Obstacle ID: 30760.0
- Distance Risk reason: This obstacle is in the same lane as the ego vehicle and is relatively close longitudinally at the latest timestep. Analysis of past data confirms it's approaching from behind.
- Distance safety score: 2
- Time Risk reason: This obstacle is faster than the ego vehicle and accelerating. The historical data shows a consistent pattern of faster velocity.
- Time safety score: 2
- Overall Risk score: 2

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. **Most critical obstacles:** Obstacle 30760.0 poses the highest risk as it's in the same lane, approaching from behind, and accelerating, thus reducing the distance rapidly. Obstacle 30751.0 is also of concern due to its high speed and lateral approach, although it is further away.

2. **Trajectory analysis:** 30760.0 exhibits a consistent trajectory within the ego vehicle's lane, and its historical positions and velocities confirm it's closing the distance. Obstacle 30751.0 is approaching but not directly in the ego's path, presenting a medium-term potential risk.

3. **Relative positions, velocities, and accelerations:**  30760.0 is consistently closer in the longitudinal direction and its higher velocity and acceleration indicate increasing risk. 30751.0 has significant lateral separation, but its high velocity requires continuous monitoring.

4. **Collision determination:** At the current time step, no collision has occurred. However, if the current trends continue, a collision with obstacle 30760.0 is highly probable in the near future.

5. **Reasoning:** Obstacle 30760.0 presents a clear danger due to its position in the same lane, rapidly decreasing distance, and higher velocity relative to the ego vehicle.

### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
  "CollisionObstacles": [],
  "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null,
  "ScenarioAnalysis": {
    "IsCollisionScenario": false,
    "Reasoning": "While no collision has occurred at the current time step, obstacle 30760.0 poses a high risk due to its location in the same lane, closing distance, and higher velocity compared to the ego vehicle. If the current trends persist, a collision is likely. Other obstacles present lower levels of risk at this specific moment."
