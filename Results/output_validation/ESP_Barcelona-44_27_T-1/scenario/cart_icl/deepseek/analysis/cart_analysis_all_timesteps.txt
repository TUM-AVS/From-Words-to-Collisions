### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. **Obstacle 30760.0** is the most critical with an overall risk score of 2 (High Risk) due to its proximity and converging trajectory.
2. No obstacles have a risk score of 0 (collision) or 1 (extreme risk).
3. Ego vehicle is decelerating, which helps mitigate risks.
4. Most obstacles are either stationary or moving away from the ego vehicle.
