### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 30743.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is far from ego and moving away laterally.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason:  Low relative longitudinal velocity. No imminent risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5
- Obstacle ID: 30751.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is laterally separated and far from ego.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: No imminent time-based risk due to lateral separation.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5
- Obstacle ID: 30757.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is moderately close longitudinally but has significant lateral separation. 
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: The obstacle is moving significantly slower than in previous timesteps. Combined with the lateral separation, the time-based risk is low.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4
- Obstacle ID: 30760.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is in the same lanelet as ego and approaching.
- Distance safety score: 2
- Time Risk reason:  Obstacle is closing in on the ego vehicle and in the same lanelet.
- Time safety score: 2
- Overall Risk score: 2

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
This is not a collision scenario. While obstacle 30760 is closing in on the ego vehicle and poses a high risk, it has not collided in the observed timesteps.  No obstacle has a risk score of 0, indicating no collisions.
