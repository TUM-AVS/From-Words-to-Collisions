### Obstacle Analysis for the Most Recent Timestep:

#### Obstacle 30743 (At time 5.3s):
- **Distance Risk Reason**: 
  - Position is steadily away from the Ego vehicle, being approximately 36m distant. Continuous slow acceleration reduces immediate threat.
  - **Distance Safety Score**: 4
- **Time Risk Reason**:
  - Low velocity and gradual acceleration indicate very low risk of reaching Ego vehicle.
  - **Time Safety Score**: 5
- **Overall Risk Score**: 4.5

#### Obstacle 30751 (At time 5.3s):
- **Distance Risk Reason**:
  - Positioned significantly far away (~30m), moving not directly towards Ego.
  - **Distance Safety Score**: 4
- **Time Risk Reason**:
  - Significant velocity but trajectory away from Ego's path limits the risk.
  - **Time Safety Score**: 4
- **Overall Risk Score**: 4

#### Obstacle 30757 (At time 5.3s):
- **Distance Risk Reason**:
  - Nearing with a trajectory that remains parallel and slightly ahead relative to Ego.
  - **Distance Safety Score**: 2
- **Time Risk Reason**:
  - Rapid deceleration but remains near due to proximity; potential for close approach highlights urgency.
  - **Time Safety Score**: 2
- **Overall Risk Score**: 2

#### Obstacle 30760 (At time 5.3s):
- **Distance Risk Reason**:
  - Positioned close and moving in the same lanelet as Ego, posing immediate risk.
  - **Distance Safety Score**: 1
- **Time Risk Reason**:
  - High velocity and proximity, with shared lanelet, indicate significant collision potential.
  - **Time Safety Score**: 1
- **Overall Risk Score**: 1

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
- The closest threats are obstacles 30757 and 30760, with 30760 being of extreme concern.
- Obstacle 30760 shares the same lane with high velocity and close proximity, warranting immediate attention for collision risk.
- Based on proximity and consistent lane sharing, Ego should focus on evasive maneuvers to avoid a potential collision with obstacle 30760.
