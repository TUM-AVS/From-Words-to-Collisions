Obstacle 30760 is at high risk of collision. It is extremely close to the ego vehicle (-0.11m behind) and its relative longitudinal velocity indicates a very high probability of a rear-end collision in the next time step.

Obstacle 30743 is also at high risk.  While the lateral distance is large (24.29m), the longitudinal distance is only 1.02m and closing.  While not an immediate collision like 30760, the closing longitudinal distance combined with the approaching lateral motion suggests a possible collision within the next few timesteps if the trajectories remain unchanged.
