### Safety analysis for timestep 4.4s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 30743
- Distance Risk reason:  Relatively close longitudinal and lateral distance (6.37m) in front-left, and moving towards the ego vehicle longitudinally.
- Distance safety score: 2
- Time Risk reason: Closing longitudinally at -5.12 m/s with a small deceleration, indicating a short TTC.
- Time safety score: 2
- Overall Risk score: 2

- Obstacle ID: 30744
- Distance Risk reason: Safe longitudinal and lateral distance (9.16m) in front-right, and moving away laterally.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Although closing longitudinally, lateral movement away mitigates risk.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3

- Obstacle ID: 30757
- Distance Risk reason: Moderate longitudinal and lateral distance (6.02m) in front-left, but moving away from the ego vehicle both longitudinally and laterally.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Moving away with a positive relative velocity and acceleration, posing no immediate threat.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 4

- Obstacle ID: 30760
- Distance Risk reason: Close proximity behind the ego vehicle (-4.11m).
- Distance safety score: 2
- Time Risk reason: Closing from behind, although with some deceleration.
- Time safety score: 2
- Overall Risk score: 2

### Safety analysis for timestep 4.5s - 5.3s:
(Analysis for each timestep from 4.5s to 5.3s would follow the same structure as above, evaluating TTC, MDC, and risk scores based on the provided data. I will provide a summary and the final JSON output considering the entire time sequence.)

Obstacle 30743 consistently poses an increasing risk across the timesteps, with both longitudinal and lateral distances decreasing while it moves towards the ego vehicle.  It represents the most significant collision risk.

Obstacle 30757 consistently moves away and poses no risk.

Obstacle 30760, initially behind, gets closer to the ego vehicle throughout the scenario, increasing the risk of a rear-end collision.

Obstacle 30744 is only present at 4.4s and moves away laterally, mitigating risk.

Obstacle 30751 appears at 5.2s and 5.3s, but its lateral movement away reduces the risk, despite closing longitudinally.

By 5.3 seconds, Obstacle 30743 is extremely close (1.02m longitudinally and laterally), indicating an imminent collision. Obstacle 30760 is also very close (-0.11m), indicating a near rear-end collision.


### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
  "CollisionObstacle": {
    "ObstacleID": "30743",
    "OverallRiskScore": "0"
  },
  "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {
    "ObstacleID": "30760",
    "OverallRiskScore": "1"
  },
  "IsCollisionScenario": true,
  "Justification": "Obstacle 30743 shows continuous decrease in distance and Time To Collision (TTC) with lateral and longitudinal relative distance less than 1.02m, relative longitudinal velocity of -3.97 m/s at 5.3 seconds.  This strongly indicates an imminent front-left collision. Additionally, Obstacle 30760 is extremely close from behind at -0.11m, indicating a very high risk of a rear-end collision. Although not strictly a collision yet, the scenario dynamics make collision virtually unavoidable within the next fraction of a second."

Important notes:  In a real-world autonomous driving system, the risk assessment would be continuous and dynamic.  The system would likely take evasive actions much earlier than the point of imminent collision indicated here.  This analysis provides a retrospective view based on the provided snapshots in time. It highlights the criticality of Obstacle 30743 and 30760 and flags the scenario as a collision due to their extremely close proximity and movement towards the ego vehicle in the final moments of the provided data.
