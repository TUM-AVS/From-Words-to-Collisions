### Obstacle-by-Obstacle Analysis (Most Recent Timestep: 5.3 seconds)

#### **Obstacle 30743 (Front-left)**
- **Adjusted Distance**: Longitudinal 1.02 m, Lateral 24.29 m  
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal -3.97 m/s (approaching), Lateral -2.21 m/s (approaching)  
- **Motion**: Driving toward ego both longitudinally and laterally.  
- **TTC (Longitudinal)**: 1.02 / 3.97 ≈ 0.26 seconds (Extreme Risk)  
- **TTC (Lateral)**: 24.29 / 2.21 ≈ 11.0 seconds (No Risk)  
- **MDC**: Lateral distance is large (24.29 m), but longitudinal distance is critical (1.02 m).  
- **Risk Assessment**:  
  - Longitudinal TTC indicates Extreme Risk (1).  
  - Lateral TTC indicates No Risk (5).  
  - **Overall Risk**: 1 (Extreme Risk) due to imminent longitudinal collision.  

#### **Obstacle 30751 (Front-left)**
- **Adjusted Distance**: Longitudinal 20.57 m, Lateral 13.11 m  
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal -4.65 m/s (approaching), Lateral 9.51 m/s (moving away)  
- **Motion**: Approaching longitudinally but moving away laterally.  
- **TTC (Longitudinal)**: 20.57 / 4.65 ≈ 4.42 seconds (Low Risk)  
- **TTC (Lateral)**: Not applicable (moving away).  
- **MDC**: Both distances are large.  
- **Risk Assessment**:  
  - **Overall Risk**: 4 (Low Risk).  

#### **Obstacle 30757 (Front-left)**
- **Adjusted Distance**: Longitudinal 9.28 m, Lateral 2.84 m  
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal 2.54 m/s (moving away), Lateral 0.36 m/s (moving away)  
- **Motion**: Moving away in both dimensions.  
- **TTC**: Not applicable (diverging paths).  
- **MDC**: Both distances are increasing.  
- **Risk Assessment**:  
  - **Overall Risk**: 5 (No Risk).  

#### **Obstacle 30760 (Behind)**
- **Adjusted Distance**: Longitudinal -0.11 m (behind), Lateral 0.00 m  
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal 6.07 m/s (approaching), Lateral 0.43 m/s (minor lateral motion)  
- **Motion**: Approaching from behind with exact lateral alignment.  
- **TTC (Longitudinal)**: 0.11 / 6.07 ≈ 0.018 seconds (Collision Risk)  
- **TTC (Lateral)**: Not applicable (lateral distance is zero but no closing velocity).  
- **MDC**: Longitudinal distance is effectively zero (collision).  
- **Risk Assessment**:  
  - **Overall Risk**: 0 (Collision).
