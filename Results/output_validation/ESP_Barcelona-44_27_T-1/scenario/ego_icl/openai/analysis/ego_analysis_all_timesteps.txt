### Obstacle-by-Obstacle Analysis at the Most Recent Timestep (5.3 seconds)

#### Obstacle 30743
- **Position and Motion**: Front-left of the ego vehicle. Adjusted longitudinal distance: 1.02 m, adjusted lateral distance: 24.29 m. Longitudinal relative velocity: -3.97 m/s (approaching), lateral relative velocity: -2.21 m/s (moving left towards the ego).
- **Trajectory Analysis**: Obstacle closing in both dimensions; motion is converging towards the ego vehicle.
- **TTC Calculation**:
  - Longitudinal TTC = 1.02 m / 3.97 m/s ≈ 0.26 seconds
  - Lateral motion increases lateral risk but is less critical due to larger distance.
- **MDC**: Longitudinal 1.02 m is the closest approach due to higher risk from closing trajectory.
- **Risk Assessment**: Extreme Risk (1) due to very low longitudinal TTC and converging trajectories.

#### Obstacle 30751
- **Position and Motion**: Front-left of the ego vehicle. Adjusted longitudinal distance: 20.57 m, adjusted lateral distance: 13.11 m. Longitudinal relative velocity: -4.65 m/s (approaching), lateral relative velocity: 9.51 m/s (moving away to the left).
- **Trajectory Analysis**: Despite negative longitudinal velocity, the lateral movement is rapidly increasing.
- **TTC Calculation**:
  - Longitudinal TTC = 20.57 m / 4.65 m/s ≈ 4.42 seconds
  - Lateral motion is increasing separation.
- **MDC**: The minimum approach is longitudinal with a high distance and increasing lateral gap.
- **Risk Assessment**: Low Risk (4) due to a larger distance and increasing lateral separation.

#### Obstacle 30757
- **Position and Motion**: Front-left of the ego vehicle. Adjusted longitudinal distance: 9.28 m, adjusted lateral distance: 2.84 m. Longitudinal relative velocity: 2.54 m/s (moving away), lateral relative velocity: 0.36 m/s (moving away left).
- **Trajectory Analysis**: Moving away in both dimensions.
- **TTC Calculation**: Not applicable as velocities indicate diverging paths.
- **MDC**: No immediate projected approach.
- **Risk Assessment**: No Risk (5) since paths are diverging.

#### Obstacle 30760
- **Position and Motion**: Behind the ego vehicle. Adjusted longitudinal distance: -0.11 m (indicating behind), adjusted lateral distance: 0.00 m. Longitudinal relative velocity: 6.07 m/s (approaching).
- **Trajectory Analysis**: Approaching from behind with exact lateral alignment.
- **TTC Calculation**: 
  - Longitudinal position negative indicates it is potentially passing the ego vehicle, further investigation of trajectory required.
- **MDC**: Very small due to approach from behind.
- **Risk Assessment**: Collision (0) if trajectory indicates intersection at negative or near zero distances.

### Determining Collision Scenario
- **Obstacle 30743** is the most critical with an Extreme Risk assessment due to low TTC in longitudinal approach.
- **Obstacle 30760** exhibits potential Collision risk based on negative longitudinal position suggesting possible intersection.

### Conclusion
This scenario has a high probability of collision with Obstacle 30760 if trajectories intersect with negligibly small distances. Additionally, the proximity and velocity dynamics of Obstacle 30743 warrant an Extreme Risk classification.
