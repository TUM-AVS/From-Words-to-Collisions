### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
    - Obstacle ID: 30743
    - Relative Direction: Front-left
    - Distance Risk Reason: DTClong is 1.02m, indicating extreme risk.  DTClat is 24.29m suggesting negligible risk. The obstacle has been consistently approaching longitudinally over the past timesteps, while the lateral distance remains large but is now beginning to decrease slightly.
    - Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 1
    - Lateral Distance Safety Score: 5
    - Overall Distance Safety Score: 3.0 (1 * 0.5 + 5 * 0.5 = 3.0)
    - Time Risk Reason: TTClong is 0.26s, indicating extreme risk. TTClat is 11.00s, indicating negligible risk.  Longitudinal TTC has been decreasing rapidly, indicating high risk of longitudinal collision.
    - Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 1
    - Lateral Time Safety Score: 5
    - Overall Time Safety Score: 3.0 (1 * 0.5 + 5 * 0.5 = 3.0)
    - Overall Risk Score: 3 (0.5 * 3.0 + 0.5 * 3.0 = 3.0)

    - Obstacle ID: 30751
    - Relative Direction: Front-left
    - Distance Risk Reason: DTClong is 20.57m and DTClat is 13.11m, both indicating negligible risk. The obstacle is far away and moving away laterally.
    - Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 5
    - Lateral Distance Safety Score: 5
    - Overall Distance Safety Score: 5.0 (5 * 0.5 + 5 * 0.5 = 5)
    - Time Risk Reason: TTClong is 4.43s indicating low risk, and TTClat is inf, indicating negligible risk. The obstacle is moving away laterally.
    - Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 4
    - Lateral Time Safety Score: 5
    - Overall Time Safety Score: 4.5 (4 * 0.5 + 5 * 0.5 = 4.5)
    - Overall Risk Score: 5 (0.5 * 5.0 + 0.5 * 4.5 = 4.75, rounded to 5)

    - Obstacle ID: 30757
    - Relative Direction: Front-left
    - Distance Risk Reason: DTClong is 9.28m and DTClat is 2.84m, indicating low and medium risk respectively. This obstacle is moving away longitudinally and laterally.
    - Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 5
    - Lateral Distance Safety Score: 3
    - Overall Distance Safety Score: 4.0 (5 * 0.5 + 3 * 0.5 = 4.0)
    - Time Risk Reason: Both TTClong and TTClat are inf, indicating negligible risk.  The obstacle is moving away from the ego vehicle.
    - Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 5
    - Lateral Time Safety Score: 5
    - Overall Time Safety Score: 5.0 (5 * 0.5 + 5 * 0.5 = 5.0)
    - Overall Risk Score: 5 (0.5 * 4.0 + 0.5 * 5.0 = 4.5, rounded to 5)


    - Obstacle ID: 30760
    - Relative Direction: Behind
    - Distance Risk Reason: DTClong is -0.11m indicating imminent collision. DTClat is 0.00m, also a collision risk.  This obstacle has been consistently approaching longitudinally from behind over the last several timesteps.
    - Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 0
    - Lateral Distance Safety Score: 0
    - Overall Distance Safety Score: 0.0 (0 * 1.0 + 0 * (1-1.0) = 0.0)
    - Time Risk Reason: TTClong is 0.02s indicating imminent collision. TTClat is 0.00s, also showing collision. The decreasing TTClong confirms the high risk of longitudinal collision.
    - Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 0
    - Lateral Time Safety Score: 0
    - Overall Time Safety Score: 0.0 (0 * 1.0 + 0 * 0.0 = 0.0)
    - Overall Risk Score: 0 (0.5 * 0.0 + 0.5 * 0.0 = 0.0)
