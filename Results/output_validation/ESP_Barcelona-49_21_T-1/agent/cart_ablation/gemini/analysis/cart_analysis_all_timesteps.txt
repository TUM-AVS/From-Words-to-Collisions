Here's the collision risk analysis:

**Obstacle 30784:** This obstacle remains stationary throughout the provided timeframe. Its position is significantly distant from the ego vehicle's trajectory, presenting no immediate risk.  Risk score: 5 (Negligible Risk).

**Obstacle 30786:** Similar to Obstacle 30784, this obstacle is stationary and far from the ego vehicle's path. Risk score: 5 (Negligible Risk).

**Obstacle 30787:** This obstacle is also stationary and poses no risk to the ego vehicle due to the significant distance between them. Risk score: 5 (Negligible Risk).

**Obstacle 30789:** This obstacle is moving in the same direction as the ego vehicle, and is located in a different lanelet, but is relatively close and with similar speed. Although no immediate collision is imminent, if the ego vehicle were to decelerate and the other vehicle were to change lanelet, this obstacle could become a collision risk. Continuous monitoring is needed. Risk score: 3 (Medium Risk).

**Collision Assessment:** No collisions are observed or predicted within the given timeframe.
