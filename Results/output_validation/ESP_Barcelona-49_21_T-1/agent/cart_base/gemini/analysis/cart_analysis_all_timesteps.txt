Obstacles 30784, 30786, and 30787 are stationary and relatively far from the ego vehicle's trajectory. While the ego vehicle is decelerating, its trajectory does not indicate an imminent collision with these parked vehicles. They represent a negligible risk.

Obstacle 30789 is moving in the same direction as the ego vehicle and in the same lanelet (1370 vs 1375 lanelets suggest parallel lanes, potentially adjacent, which needs confirmation with map data). Both vehicles are decelerating.  However, Obstacle 30789 is consistently behind the ego vehicle, and the distance between them appears to be increasing over the observed time steps. This, combined with similar orientations, suggests a low collision risk.

Therefore, no obstacles present a collision, extreme, or high risk.
