### Analysis:

1. **Obstacle 30787.0**:
   - Position: (130.3576, -224.3635), stationary (velocity = 0.0, acceleration = 0.0).
   - Ego vehicle is moving towards this obstacle with decreasing velocity (from 6.8146 m/s to 3.5348 m/s over the timesteps).
   - Distance between ego and obstacle: ~12.3m at 4.1s (calculated using Euclidean distance).
   - TTC: Decreasing but still positive (ego is decelerating). No immediate collision risk.
   - Risk: **Low (4)**.

2. **Obstacle 30786.0**:
   - Position: (132.8436, -221.8975), stationary (velocity = 0.0, acceleration = 0.0).
   - Distance from ego: ~10.5m at 4.1s.
   - TTC: Not critical as ego is decelerating and lateral distance is significant.
   - Risk: **Low (4)**.

3. **Obstacle 30784.0**:
   - Position: (135.3298, -219.4417), stationary (velocity = 0.0, acceleration = 0.0).
   - Distance from ego: ~8.7m at 4.1s.
   - TTC: Not critical, ego is decelerating.
   - Risk: **Low (4)**.

4. **Obstacle 30789.0**:
   - Position: (150.9357, -235.1650), moving with velocity = 4.0254 m/s, decelerating (acceleration = -2.0754).
   - Distance from ego: ~12.0m at 4.1s.
   - Relative velocity: ego is decelerating faster, but obstacle is also decelerating.
   - TTC: Not critical, paths are not converging directly.
   - Risk: **Medium (3)**.

### Conclusion:
- No obstacles pose an immediate collision or extreme risk.
- All obstacles are either stationary or moving away from the ego vehicle's path.
- The ego vehicle is decelerating, reducing any potential risks further.
