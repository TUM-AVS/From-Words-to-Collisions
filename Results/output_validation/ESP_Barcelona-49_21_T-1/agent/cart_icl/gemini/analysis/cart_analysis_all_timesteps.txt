Obstacles 30784, 30786, and 30787 are stationary and far from the ego vehicle, posing negligible risk. Obstacle 30789 is in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle and moving in the same direction.  Although the ego vehicle's velocity is decreasing more rapidly than obstacle 30789's, they are still moving apart.  Given the substantial distance between them at the last timestep (150.9357, -235.165) vs (139.0216, -223.132) and the difference in orientation, the risk of collision is low.
