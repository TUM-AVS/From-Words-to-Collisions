In this analysis, we will evaluate the risk levels of each obstacle relative to the ego vehicle based on their Cartesian coordinates, velocity, and acceleration over the given time frame, focusing primarily on the most recent timestep at 4.1 seconds. We'll use Time to Collision (TTC) and Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC) as metrics.

### Obstacle Analysis:

1. **Obstacle 30784.0:**
   - Position: (135.3298, -219.4417)
   - Velocity: 0.0 m/s
   - This obstacle remains stationary over the entire timeframe, maintaining a consistent position.
   - Relative position to Ego at 4.1s: ~4 meters laterally and ~3 meters longitudinally.
   - As it's positioned at a safe lateral distance and stationary, risk is minimal.
   - **Risk Level: 5 (Negligible Risk)**

2. **Obstacle 30786.0:**
   - Position: (132.8436, -221.8975)
   - Velocity: 0.0 m/s
   - Like Obstacle 30784.0, this one remains in a constant position, indicating no immediate collision risk.
   - Relatively farther in positioning both laterally and longitudinally from Ego.
   - **Risk Level: 5 (Negligible Risk)**

3. **Obstacle 30787.0:**
   - Position: (130.3576, -224.3635)
   - Velocity: 0.0 m/s
   - Stationary and located ~9 meters behind the current Ego position.
   - At a greater distance and not on a collision trajectory.
   - **Risk Level: 5 (Negligible Risk)**

4. **Obstacle 30789.0:**
   - Position: (150.9357, -235.165)
   - Velocity: 4.0254 m/s
   - This vehicle is moving at a similar but slightly slower speed compared to the Ego, both having decelerated over time.
   - It's ahead on a different lanelet with increasing separation, indicating no closing trajectory.
   - **Risk Level: 4 (Low Risk)**

Evaluating the obstacles, none are on a collision course or present immediate danger to the Ego vehicle. All obstacles maintain safe distances and velocities with respect to the Ego's trajectory.

### JSON Output:

```json
{
    "CollisionObstacles": [],
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null,
    "HighRiskObstacle": null
}
```

This output indicates that no obstacles assessed are at collision or extreme risk level based on the given scenario data.
