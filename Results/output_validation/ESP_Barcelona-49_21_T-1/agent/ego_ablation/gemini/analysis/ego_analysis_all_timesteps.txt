At t=4.1 seconds, the ego vehicle faces an imminent collision risk with obstacle 30784. Obstacles 30786 and 30787 also present extreme risks. Obstacle 30789 poses no immediate threat.

Obstacle 30784:
- Proximity: Extremely close at 0.71m longitudinally and 0.00m laterally.
- MDC: ~0.71m, indicating Extreme Risk (1).
- TTC:  Collision is imminent within the next timestep as the distance is closing rapidly with a high negative relative velocity. TTC is estimated to be less than 0.1 second, indicating Extreme Risk (1).
- Overall Risk Score: 1 (Extreme Risk)

Obstacle 30786:
- Proximity: Very close at 0.66m longitudinally and 1.99m laterally.
- MDC: ~0.66m. Although slightly further than 30784, it still represents an Extreme Risk (1).
- TTC: Similar to 30784, a collision is highly likely within the next timestep given the closing distance and velocity. TTC is estimated to be less than 0.1 second, indicating Extreme Risk (1).
- Overall Risk Score: 1 (Extreme Risk)


Obstacle 30787:
- Proximity: Very close at 0.60m longitudinally and 5.50m laterally.
- MDC: ~0.60m indicating Extreme Risk (1).
- TTC: Collision likely in the next timestep. Similar to other front obstacles, TTC is less than 0.1 seconds, indicating Extreme Risk (1)
- Overall Risk Score: 1 (Extreme Risk)


Obstacle 30789:
- Proximity: Relatively far at -12.42m longitudinally (behind the ego vehicle).
- MDC: >5m. No collision risk from this obstacle in the foreseeable future.
- TTC: Not applicable as the obstacle is moving away.
- Overall Risk Score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
