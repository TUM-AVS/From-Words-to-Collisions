At t=4.1s, Obstacle 30784 is in front of the ego vehicle at a longitudinal distance of 0.71m and closing at -3.53 m/s.  Given the close proximity and negative relative velocity, this obstacle represents an extreme risk of collision.

Obstacle 30786 and 30787 are also closing but are further away laterally.  They present a high risk.

Obstacle 30789 is approaching from behind but is still relatively far, posing less of a risk than the obstacles in front.


Risk Levels:
0: Collision - Physical contact occurred or unavoidable
1: Extreme Risk - Immediate collision likely
2: High Risk - Close to collision, needs quick action
3: Medium Risk - Manageable with proper reaction
4: Low Risk - Minimal risk, sufficient time to react
5: Negligible Risk - No significant risk
