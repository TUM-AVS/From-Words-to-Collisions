### Safety analysis for timestep 4.1 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

Given that the lateral distances are equal to the longitudinal distances and the lateral velocities are zero or near zero, it suggests a diagonal approach/recession with minimal lateral movement relative to the ego vehicle. We'll primarily use longitudinal metrics for risk assessment, but acknowledge the lateral component contributes to overall proximity.  It's also worth noting that obstacles 30786 and 30787 appear to be exhibiting very similar behavior and proximity. They might represent a single, larger object tracked as two distinct entities.


### Obstacle Analysis:

**- Obstacle ID: 30784**
- Distance Risk reason:  At 0.71m longitudinally in front, this obstacle is extremely close to the ego vehicle.
- Distance safety score: 1 (Extreme Risk)
- Time Risk reason:  A negative relative longitudinal velocity indicates closing, and the short distance implies a very low TTC. While a precise TTC can't be calculated without further information, the closing speed and proximity suggest imminent collision.
- Time safety score: 1 (Extreme Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 1 (Extreme Risk)

**- Obstacle ID: 30786**
- Distance Risk reason: At 0.66m longitudinally in the front-left, this obstacle poses an extreme risk due to its proximity.
- Distance safety score: 1 (Extreme Risk)
- Time Risk reason: Similar to 30784, the negative relative longitudinal velocity and close proximity indicate a high likelihood of collision very soon.
- Time safety score: 1 (Extreme Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 1 (Extreme Risk)

**- Obstacle ID: 30787**
- Distance Risk reason: At 0.60m longitudinally in the front-left, this is the closest obstacle and presents the highest risk of immediate collision.
- Distance safety score: 1 (Extreme Risk)
- Time Risk reason: With similar longitudinal dynamics to 30786, the slightly closer proximity increases the risk.
- Time safety score: 1 (Extreme Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 1 (Extreme Risk)

**- Obstacle ID: 30789**
- Distance Risk reason:  At -12.42m longitudinally (behind), this obstacle is a safe distance away.
- Distance safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- Time Risk reason: While it's moving toward the ego car from behind, the longitudinal velocity is relatively low and the distance large, providing ample time to react. 
- Time safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
