To evaluate the collision risk from the provided scenario, the analysis will cover each obstacle's movements and potential risks during the last timestep (4.1 seconds).

### Obstacle Analysis

#### Obstacle 30784:
- **Position**: Directly in Front
- **Adjusted Distance**: Longitudinal 0.71m, Lateral 0.00m
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal -3.53 m/s
- **Motion**: Driving toward the ego car longitudinally

- **Trajectory**: The obstacle is rapidly closing the distance to the ego vehicle with a longitudinal velocity of -3.53 m/s. The lateral alignment (0.00m) suggests the obstacle is in the same lane as the ego car, but not necessarily colliding.

- **TTC Calculation**:
  - **TTC**: \( \text{TTC} = \frac{0.71 \text{ m}}{|3.53 \text{ m/s}|} \approx 0.20 \text{ seconds} \)
  - **Assessment**: TTC is less than 0.5 seconds, indicating an extreme risk of immediate collision.

- **MDC Assessment**:
  - **MDC**: Since the adjusted longitudinal distance is only 0.71m and decreasing, it's less than 0.5m (very close to extreme risk).

- **Overall Risk**: Collision Risk (0)

#### Obstacle 30786:
- **Position**: Front-Left
- **Adjusted Distance**: Longitudinal 0.66m, Lateral 1.99m
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal -3.53 m/s
- **Motion**: Driving toward the ego car longitudinally

- **Trajectory**: The obstacle is approaching the ego vehicle from diagonally left. Velocity indicates closing distance on the longitudinal direction.

- **TTC Calculation**:
  - **TTC Longitudinal**: \( \frac{0.66 \text{ m}}{|3.53 \text{ m/s}|} \approx 0.19 \text{ seconds} \)
  - **Assessment**: A TTC less than 0.5 seconds suggests a high collision risk, compounded by decreasing longitudinal distance.

- **MDC Assessment**:
  - **MDC**: The critical path is the decreasing longitudinal distance, placing this in an extreme risk category.

- **Overall Risk**: Extreme Risk (1)

#### Obstacle 30787:
- **Position**: Front-Left
- **Adjusted Distance**: Longitudinal 0.60m, Lateral 5.50m
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal -3.53 m/s
- **Motion**: Driving toward the ego car longitudinally

- **Trajectory**: Less immediately threatening due to the larger lateral distance but still converging longitudinally.

- **TTC Calculation**:
  - **TTC Longitudinal**: \( \frac{0.60 \text{ m}}{|3.53 \text{ m/s}|} \approx 0.17 \text{ seconds} \)
  - **Assessment**: Very close proximity with a short longitudinal TTC; high risk, but less than direct front or closer angular.

- **MDC Assessment**:
  - **MDC**: Minimum distance concern, given larger lateral.

- **Overall Risk**: Extreme Risk (1)

#### Obstacle 30789:
- **Position**: Behind
- **Adjusted Distance**: Longitudinal -12.42m
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal 0.49 m/s
- **Motion**: Moving away, slight adjustment toward

- **Trajectory**: Given the negative longitudinal distance, this obstacle is fully in the rear, drifting further away.

- **TTC**: Not applicable (moving away)
- **MDC**: Not immediate due to separation.

- **Overall Risk**: Negligible Risk (5)

### Conclusion

The current analysis emphasizes Obstacle 30784 with the most imminent collision threat due to the minimized distance and highly adverse trajectory near 0m in the same directional path. Obstacle 30786 and 30787 also pose high imminent risk due to similar directional trajectories but slightly mitigated by minor lateral offsets.
