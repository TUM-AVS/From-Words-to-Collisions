At t=4.3s, the ego vehicle (30788.0) is at (138.5304, -222.6073) in lanelet 3814.0.  Obstacle 30784.0 is stationary at (135.3298, -219.4417), also in lanelet 3814.0. The x-coordinates are close, and the ego vehicle has entered the same lanelet as the obstacle.  The ego vehicle's deceleration is not enough to avoid a collision given its y-velocity. Thus, a collision is highly likely in the next time step.

Obstacle 30787.0 is at (130.3576, -224.3635) in lanelet 3812, posing no immediate threat. Similarly, obstacles 30786.0 (lanelet 3813) and 30789.0 (lanelet 1370) are not collision risks at this time step.

    "Reasoning": "Ego vehicle 30788.0 is likely to collide with static obstacle 30784.0 in the next timestep as they are both located in the same lanelet 3814 and the ego vehicle's current trajectory and deceleration will not prevent contact."
