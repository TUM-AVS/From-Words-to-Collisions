At t=4.3s, Ego (30788.0) is in lanelet 3814.0 and decelerating. Obstacle 30784.0 is also in lanelet 3814.0, stationary, and at the same lateral position as the ego vehicle is approaching. This indicates a very high risk of collision. Other obstacles are not in the same lanelet and pose no immediate threat.
