### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 30784.0
- Distance Risk reason: The obstacle is located at (135.3298, -219.4417) while the ego vehicle is at (138.5304, -222.6073).  While the y-coordinates suggest some longitudinal separation, the x-coordinates indicate lateral proximity. Over the past timesteps, the ego vehicle has been decelerating and changing lanelets, approaching the obstacle's lanelet. This lateral movement and deceleration toward the stationary obstacle, despite the existing distance, necessitates close monitoring due to the ego vehicle's lane change maneuver into the obstacle's lane.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: The obstacle is stationary. However, the ego vehicle's deceleration and lateral movement toward the obstacle suggests a potential collision risk if the ego vehicle continues on its current trajectory and deceleration trend. The data shows the ego vehicle's lane change maneuver into the path of the stationary obstacle.  While the ego vehicle is slowing down, its continuous motion towards the stationary obstacle creates a time-sensitive situation.
- Time safety score: 2
- Overall Risk score: 2

- Obstacle ID: 30786.0
- Distance Risk reason:  This obstacle, at (132.8436, -221.8975), is laterally further away from the ego vehicle (138.5304, -222.6073) than obstacle 30784.0, and slightly behind it longitudinally. Although the ego vehicle is changing lanes, the lateral distance and the obstacle's stationary nature slightly reduces the immediate risk compared to 30784.0. However, continuous observation is crucial given the ego vehicle's dynamic state.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: The obstacle is stationary.  The ego vehicle's lane change maneuver introduces some risk, though the lateral distance provides a small buffer.  Continuous monitoring is still needed.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3

- Obstacle ID: 30787.0
- Distance Risk reason: Located at (130.3576, -224.3635), this obstacle poses the least risk among the stationary obstacles due to its greater lateral distance from the ego vehicle (138.5304, -222.6073). The ego vehicleâ€™s trajectory isn't directly toward this obstacle, affording greater lateral separation.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: This stationary obstacle presents minimal risk because of the increasing lateral separation provided by the ego vehicle's trajectory.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- Obstacle ID: 30789.0
- Distance Risk reason: This obstacle at (150.3952, -234.6204) is significantly behind and to the right of the ego vehicle (138.5304, -222.6073), showing no immediate risk of collision, and maintaining safe separation during the observed period.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason:  The obstacle is moving slightly slower than the ego vehicle and is in a different lane, implying an increasing separation and, therefore, low collision probability.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5


### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. **Most critical obstacles:** Obstacles 30784.0 and 30786.0 are the most critical as they are stationary within the lanelet the ego vehicle is moving into.

2. **Trajectory analysis:** Over the 10 timesteps, the ego vehicle decelerates and moves laterally, crossing into lanelet 3814 where obstacles 30784.0, 30786.0, and 30787.0 are located. While the ego vehicle is decelerating, it's moving towards these stationary obstacles.

3. **Relative position, velocity, and acceleration:** The ego vehicle's lateral movement is concerning.  Although the ego vehicle is decelerating, the stationary obstacles in its path represent a potential collision point. The continued lateral movement toward obstacle 30784.0 suggests a possible lane change maneuver that puts the ego vehicle on a direct collision path.

4. **Collision determination:** At the final timestep (4.3s), a collision has not occurred. However, the ego vehicle's trajectory and continuous lateral movement indicate a high risk of collision with obstacle 30784.0 in the near future.

5. **Reasoning:** The ego vehicle's trajectory shows a clear pattern of lateral movement toward the stationary obstacle 30784.0. Though the ego vehicle is decelerating, the rate may not be sufficient to avoid collision given the closing distance and the obstacle's static nature.
