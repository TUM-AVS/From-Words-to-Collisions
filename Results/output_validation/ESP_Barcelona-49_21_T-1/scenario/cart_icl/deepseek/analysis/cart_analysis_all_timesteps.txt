### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep (4.3 seconds):

### Obstacle Analysis:
1. **Obstacle ID: 30784.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Static obstacle (velocity = 0), located at (135.3298, -219.4417). Ego is at (138.5304, -222.6073). Distance is ~4.5m (Euclidean). Ego is decelerating and moving away from this obstacle.
   - **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: Static obstacle, no relative velocity.
   - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low Risk)

2. **Obstacle ID: 30785.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Located at (80.2448, -245.3426), far from ego (~58m). Moving slowly (3.0644 m/s) but not in ego's path.
   - **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: Moving away from ego, no convergence in trajectories.
   - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)

3. **Obstacle ID: 30786.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Static obstacle at (132.8436, -221.8975). Distance to ego is ~5.7m. Ego is decelerating and moving away.
   - **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: Static obstacle, no relative velocity.
   - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low Risk)

4. **Obstacle ID: 30787.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Static obstacle at (130.3576, -224.3635). Distance to ego is ~8.5m. Ego is decelerating and moving away.
   - **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: Static obstacle, no relative velocity.
   - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low Risk)

5. **Obstacle ID: 30789.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Located at (150.3952, -234.6204), ~12.5m from ego. Moving in same direction as ego but decelerating (3.7261 m/s). No immediate convergence.
   - **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: Relative velocity is low (~0.87 m/s), and both are decelerating.
   - **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low Risk)

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. No obstacles are in direct collision path with ego.
2. All obstacles are either static or moving away from ego.
3. Ego is decelerating, reducing risk further.
4. No abrupt changes in trajectories observed in the last 10 timesteps.
5. Closest obstacle (30784.0) is ~4.5m away, and ego is moving away from it.
