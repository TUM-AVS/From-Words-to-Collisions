### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 30784.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is laterally separated and poses no immediate risk. The ego vehicle is moving away from the obstacle.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason:  The obstacle is stationary and poses no risk. The ego vehicle's trajectory does not intersect with it.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 30786.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is laterally separated and poses no immediate risk. The ego vehicle is moving away from the obstacle.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason:  The obstacle is stationary and poses no risk. The ego vehicle's trajectory does not intersect with it.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 30787.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is laterally separated and poses no immediate risk. The ego vehicle is moving away from the obstacle.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason:  The obstacle is stationary and poses no risk. The ego vehicle's trajectory does not intersect with it.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 30789.0
- Distance Risk reason: The obstacle is behind and to the right of the ego vehicle. Both are moving in the same direction and the distance between them is relatively large and increasing.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Both vehicles are moving in the same general direction, but the ego vehicle's trajectory does not intersect with the obstacle's based on current data.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
The ego vehicle is moving away from all stationary obstacles (30784, 30786, and 30787). Obstacle 30789 is behind the ego vehicle, also moving in the same general direction, and the distance between them is increasing.  Therefore, this is not a collision scenario.

### Summary in JSON Format:

{
  "CollisionObstacles": [],
  "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null,
  "ScenarioAnalysis": {
    "IsCollisionScenario": false,
    "Reasoning": "No obstacles pose an immediate collision risk. Stationary obstacles are laterally separated, and the moving obstacle is behind the ego vehicle with increasing distance."
