### Obstacle Analysis:

#### Obstacle ID: 30784.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: Obstacle 30784.0 is stationary and maintains a significant distance from the ego vehicle. The obstacle's relative position has not changed over time.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: With a velocity of 0.0, there is no immediate risk of future collision due to lack of movement.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 30786.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: This stationary obstacle remains a constant distance from the ego vehicle, with no trajectory change observed.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: With no movement observed, the risk of temporal collision remains negligible.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 30787.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: Similar to the other stationary obstacles, 30787.0 maintains a safe distance with no trajectory changes.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: The obstacle is not moving, maintaining the safety risk as negligible.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 30789.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: Positioned in a different lanelet from the ego vehicle, 30789.0 is moving away. Its trajectory over time indicates no likelihood of intersecting the ego vehicle's path.
- **Distance safety score**: 4
- **Time Risk reason**: Obstacle 30789.0â€™s velocity is consistently decreasing, moving away from the ego vehicle, mitigating any potential temporal collision risk.
- **Time safety score**: 4
- **Overall Risk score**: 4

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. The scenario involves a mix of stationary obstacles (30784.0, 30786.0, 30787.0) and a mobile obstacle (30789.0).
2. Stationary obstacles are positioned in separate lanelets and maintain a safe distance from the ego vehicle, leading to negligible risk.
3. The mobile obstacle, 30789.0, consistently moves away in a separate lane, with decreasing velocity and no risk of converging paths.
4. No collision risk exists as all obstacles are stationary or moving away, with adequate distance maintained.
