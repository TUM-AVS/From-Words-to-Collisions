Obstacle 30784 is in direct collision with the ego vehicle as the longitudinal and lateral distances are both 0.  Obstacles 30786 and 30787 are also at longitudinal distance 0, meaning they are aligned longitudinally with the ego vehicle. Though they have some lateral separation currently (2.07m and 5.57m respectively), the imminent collision with Obstacle 30784 makes their situation extremely dangerous as subsequent avoidance maneuvers are severely limited. Obstacle 30789 poses no immediate threat as it is behind the ego vehicle and moving away.
