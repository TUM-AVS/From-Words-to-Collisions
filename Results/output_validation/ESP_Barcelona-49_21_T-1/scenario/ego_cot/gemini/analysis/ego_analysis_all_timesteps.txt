### Safety analysis for timestep 3.4s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 30784
- Distance Risk reason: The obstacle is 4.52m in front and slightly to the side (4.52m lateral)  of the ego vehicle and moving towards it longitudinally. This represents a close proximity.
- Distance safety score: 2
- Time Risk reason: The relative longitudinal velocity is -6.35 m/s, indicating closing speed.  Given the distance and constant velocity, the TTC is approximately 4.52m / 6.35m/s = 0.71s. This is extremely dangerous.
- Time safety score: 1
- Overall Risk score: 1

- Obstacle ID: 30786
- Distance Risk reason: Similar to obstacle 30784, this obstacle is also at close proximity (4.53m longitudinal and lateral) and approaching the ego vehicle.
- Distance safety score: 2
- Time Risk reason: Almost identical to 30784, the TTC is ~0.71s, indicating extreme risk.
- Time safety score: 1
- Overall Risk score: 1

- Obstacle ID: 30787
- Distance Risk reason:  Again, this obstacle mirrors the risk profile of the previous two with close proximity (4.54m longitudinal and lateral).
- Distance safety score: 2
- Time Risk reason:  With similar relative velocity and distance, the TTC is also ~0.71s, posing an extreme risk.
- Time safety score: 1
- Overall Risk score: 1

- Obstacle ID: 30789
- Distance Risk reason: This obstacle is behind the ego vehicle (-11.81m longitudinal and lateral) and moving away.  It presents no immediate risk.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: The negative relative velocity with a positive relative acceleration means the obstacle might approach in future but not immediately. This is not a current risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5


### Safety analysis for timestep 3.5s - 4.2s:

*(Analysis for timesteps 3.5s to 4.2s would follow the same structure as 3.4s.  The key difference is that the distances to obstacles 30784, 30786, and 30787 decrease over time, further increasing the risk.  TTC values will also decrease, indicating escalating danger.)*

For brevity, I am omitting the full analysis for these intermediate steps, but it is crucial to perform them in a real-world scenario. The risk level for obstacles 30784, 30786 and 30787 would likely transition from Extreme (1) to Collision (0) during these timesteps.


### Safety analysis for timestep 4.3s:
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 30784

- Distance safety score: 0
- Time Risk reason:  TTC is now zero, indicating collision.
- Time safety score: 0
- Overall Risk score: 0

- Obstacle ID: 30786
- Distance Risk reason: Collision has occurred (0m longitudinal and lateral distance).
- Distance safety score: 0
- Time Risk reason: TTC is now zero, indicating collision.
- Time safety score: 0

- Obstacle ID: 30787
- Distance Risk reason: Collision has occurred (0m longitudinal and lateral distance).
- Distance safety score: 0
- Time Risk reason: TTC is now zero, indicating collision.
- Time safety score: 0
- Overall Risk score: 0

- Obstacle ID: 30789
- Distance Risk reason:  Still behind and not posing an immediate threat.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Although getting closer itâ€™s still far behind.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5
