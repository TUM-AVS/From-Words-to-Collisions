### Obstacle-by-Obstacle Analysis (Most Recent Timestep: 4.3s)

#### **Obstacle 30784** (Collision Position)
- **Adjusted Distance**: Longitudinal = 0.00m, Lateral = 0.00m  
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal = -2.85 m/s (approaching), Lateral = 0.00 m/s  
- **Motion**: Exact longitudinal and lateral alignment (collision occurring)  
- **TTC**: 0.00s (collision is happening now)  
- **MDC**: 0.00m (collision confirmed)  
- **Risk Score**: 0 (Collision)  

**Trajectory Analysis**:  
- From 3.4s to 4.3s, longitudinal distance decreased from 4.52m to 0.00m with consistent closing velocity.  
- Lateral alignment remained exact (0.00m) throughout.  
- Collision is unavoidable at 4.3s.

#### **Obstacle 30786** (Left Position)
- **Adjusted Distance**: Longitudinal = 0.00m, Lateral = 2.07m  
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal = -2.85 m/s (approaching), Lateral = 0.00 m/s  
- **Motion**: Exact longitudinal alignment but no lateral motion.  
- **TTC**: 0.00s (longitudinal alignment but lateral distance safe).  
- **MDC**: 2.07m (lateral distance prevents collision).  
- **Risk Score**: 3 (Medium Risk due to longitudinal alignment but safe lateral gap).  

**Trajectory Analysis**:  
- Longitudinal distance closed from 4.53m to 0.00m, but lateral distance remained stable (~1.87m–2.07m).  
- No lateral convergence → no collision risk despite longitudinal alignment.

#### **Obstacle 30787** (Left Position)
- **Adjusted Distance**: Longitudinal = 0.00m, Lateral = 5.57m  
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal = -2.85 m/s, Lateral = 0.00 m/s  
- **Motion**: Exact longitudinal alignment but large lateral gap.  
- **TTC**: 0.00s (longitudinal alignment).  
- **MDC**: 5.57m (far beyond collision range).  
- **Risk Score**: 5 (No Risk).  

**Trajectory Analysis**:  
- Lateral distance increased slightly (5.37m → 5.57m).  
- No threat of collision.

#### **Obstacle 30789** (Behind Position)
- **Adjusted Distance**: Longitudinal = -12.37m, Lateral = 0.00m  
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal = 0.87 m/s (moving away), Lateral = 0.12 m/s  
- **Motion**: Moving away longitudinally.  
- **TTC**: N/A (diverging paths).  
- **MDC**: 12.37m (safe distance).  
- **Risk Score**: 5 (No Risk).  

**Trajectory Analysis**:  
- Longitudinal distance increased (from -11.81m to -12.37m).  
- No collision risk.
