Obstacle 30784:
- Trajectory: This obstacle has been consistently in front of the ego vehicle and approaching rapidly over the past several timesteps. The longitudinal distance has decreased from 4.52m to 0.00m. Lateral distance remains at 0.00m, indicating continued alignment in the same lane.
- TTC: Longitudinal TTC at 4.3 seconds is not applicable for collision (as MDC = 0.00m).
- MDC: 0.00m.
- Risk: Collision (0) due to the longitudinal and lateral distances being 0, motion description stating a collision.

Obstacle 30786:
- Trajectory: This obstacle has been approaching the ego vehicle from the front-left. While the longitudinal distance has decreased significantly (4.53m to 0.00m), there is a stable lateral distance of approximately 2.07m. 
- TTC: Longitudinal TTC at 4.3 seconds is not applicable for collision due to the distances being at 0.
- MDC: Approximately 2.07m.
- Risk: Medium (3) due to the MDC.

Obstacle 30787:
- Trajectory: Similar to Obstacle 30786, this obstacle is approaching from the front-left. The longitudinal distance has decreased (4.54m to 0.00m), and the lateral distance remains around 5.57m. 
- TTC: Longitudinal TTC at 4.3 seconds is not applicable for collision due to the distances being at 0.
- MDC: Approximately 5.57m.
- Risk: Low (4) due to the MDC.

Obstacle 30789:
- Trajectory: This obstacle is behind the ego vehicle and moving away, increasing the longitudinal distance from -11.81m to -12.37m. It presents no collision risk.
- TTC: Longitudinal TTC is not applicable because the obstacle is moving away.
- MDC: Not applicable.
- Risk: No Risk (5) due to separation and diverging trajectory.

Collision Scenario Determination:
Yes, this is a collision scenario because Obstacle 30784 has collided with the ego vehicle (Risk score 0).
