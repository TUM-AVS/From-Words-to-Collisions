### Obstacle Analysis

#### Obstacle 30784:
- **Position Changes and Trajectory**: From 4.2s to 4.3s, the longitudinal distance changed from 0.33 m to 0.00 m with a consistently decreasing velocity, indicating a collision.
- **MDC**: 0.00 m (collision indicated by very small longitudinal distance).
- **TTC Calculation**: Since the distance is zero and relative velocity is negative, the obstacle is colliding with the ego vehicle.
- **Risk Assessment**: The situation has escalated from extreme risk to collision, hence a risk score of 0 is assigned.

#### Obstacle 30786:
- **Position Changes and Trajectory**: The obstacle is very close with longitudinal distance of 0.00 m but lateral distance is 2.07 m.
- **MDC**: 0.00 m (longitudinal) and 2.07 m (lateral).
- **TTC Calculation**: Not a lateral collision likely due to sufficient clearance (2.07m lateral), but longitudinal position is aligned.
- **Risk Assessment**: Medium risk score of 3, as lateral distance prevents collision.

#### Obstacle 30787:
- **Position Changes and Trajectory**: Longitudinal approximate zero distance but large lateral clearance of 5.57m.
- **MDC**: 0.00 m (longitudinal) and 5.57 m (lateral).
- **TTC Calculation**: No imminent collision due to high lateral separation.
- **Risk Assessment**: Low risk with a score of 4 due to substantial lateral clearance preventing intersection.

#### Obstacle 30789:
- **Position Changes and Trajectory**: Positioned far behind, no immediate collision risk. 
- **MDC**: Not applicable due to increasing separation.
- **TTC Calculation**: Not applicable as relative velocity and distance are increasing.
- **Risk Assessment**: Low risk with a score of 5 due to the consistent distance and relative velocities further separating.

### Collision Summary
- **Collision Detected**: Obstacle 30784 is directly colliding with the ego vehicle at 4.3s.
- **Extreme Risks**: None, since closest risks are below the threshold for extreme assessment.
- **Overall Collision Scenario**: True, confirmed by Obstacle 30784's interaction.
