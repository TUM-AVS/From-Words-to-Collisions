### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
    - Obstacle ID: 30784
    - Relative Direction: Front
    - Distance Risk Reason: DTClong is 0.0m indicating a collision.  The obstacle has been approaching the ego vehicle longitudinally over the past several timesteps, with DTClong steadily decreasing. DTClat is 0.0m, indicating no lateral offset.
    - Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 0
    - Lateral Distance Safety Score: 0
    - Overall Distance Safety Score: 0.0
    - Time Risk Reason: TTClong is 0.0s, confirming the collision. TTClat is 0.0s.
    - Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 0
    - Lateral Time Safety Score: 0
    - Overall Time Safety Score: 0.0
    - Overall Risk Score: 0

    - Obstacle ID: 30786
    - Relative Direction: Left
    - Distance Risk Reason: DTClong is 0.0m. The obstacle has reached the same longitudinal position as the ego vehicle. DTClat is 2.07m, providing some lateral separation but still presenting a high risk due to the longitudinal alignment.
    - Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 0
    - Lateral Distance Safety Score: 2
    - Overall Distance Safety Score: 2.0
    - Time Risk Reason: TTClong is 0.0s. TTClat is inf, suggesting no lateral collision risk.
    - Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 0
    - Lateral Time Safety Score: 5
    - Overall Time Safety Score: 5.0
    - Overall Risk Score: 4

    - Obstacle ID: 30787
    - Relative Direction: Left
    - Distance Risk Reason: DTClong is 0.0m, indicating no longitudinal separation.  DTClat is 5.57m, providing a safe lateral distance.
    - Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 0
    - Lateral Distance Safety Score: 5
    - Overall Distance Safety Score: 5.0
    - Time Risk Reason: TTClong is 0.0s while TTClat is inf.  This indicates a passing scenario with no lateral collision risk.
    - Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 0
    - Lateral Time Safety Score: 5
    - Overall Time Safety Score: 5.0
    - Overall Risk Score: 5

    - Obstacle ID: 30789
    - Relative Direction: Behind
    - Distance Risk Reason: DTClong is -12.37m, placing the obstacle well behind the ego vehicle. DTClat is 0.0m, suggesting direct alignment along the longitudinal axis.
    - Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 5
    - Lateral Distance Safety Score: 0
    - Overall Distance Safety Score: 5.0
    - Time Risk Reason: TTClong is 14.23s, indicating the obstacle is moving towards the ego vehicle but poses no immediate threat. TTClat is 0.0s.
    - Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 5
    - Lateral Time Safety Score: 0
    - Overall Time Safety Score: 5.0
    - Overall Risk Score: 5
