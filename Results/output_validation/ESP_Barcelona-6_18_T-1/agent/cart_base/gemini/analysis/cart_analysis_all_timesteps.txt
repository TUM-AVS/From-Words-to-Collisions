Obstacle 30718, 30722, and 30723 are static and far from the ego vehicle, posing negligible risk.

Obstacle 30726 is moving away from the ego vehicle, thus presenting negligible risk despite its increasing velocity. Note its significant orientation change, suggesting a turn.

Obstacle 30732 is moving somewhat towards the ego vehicle, but its lateral distance suggests a low risk currently. Its acceleration is fluctuating.

Obstacle 30733 is in the same lane as the ego vehicle and relatively close. Its low velocity and deceleration suggest a negligible risk at this moment, but continued monitoring is essential.

Obstacle 30734 is adjacent to the ego vehicle's lane and relatively close. Its low velocity and deceleration suggest a low risk currently, but its proximity requires attention.

Obstacles 30735 and 30739 are in adjacent lanes and moving slowly, presenting low risk.  

Obstacle 30736 is moderately far from the ego vehicle, but its increasing velocity warrants monitoring, classifying it as a medium risk currently.

Obstacle 30737 is in a different lane and relatively far, posing low risk despite its high velocity.

Obstacle 30740 is in an adjacent lane and decelerating, presenting a low risk at this time.

Obstacles 30742, 30744 and 30746 are far from the ego vehicle and in different lanes and are low risk despite their higher velocities and changing accelerations.
