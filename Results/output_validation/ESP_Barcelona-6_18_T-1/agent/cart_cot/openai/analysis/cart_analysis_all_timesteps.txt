### Brief Analysis:

In analyzing the most recent timestep at 4.7 seconds, we see several stationary and moving obstacles relative to the Ego vehicle:

1. **Obstacle 30726.0** is moving significantly faster than any other obstacle, with a 5.6106 m/s velocity. It's in close proximity to the Ego's trajectory due to the significant change in its heading, which increases its risk of a near-future collision.
2. **Obstacle 30746.0** is traveling at a velocity of 3.6156 m/s with considerable acceleration changes, indicating significant motion towards the ego. Despite the lack of direct collision path, its trajectory suggests a potential risk as it moves within the lane structure close to the Ego.

After conducting calculations based on the identified motion trends, anticipated paths, and considering Time to Collision (TTC) and Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC), it is evident that obstacle 30726.0 presents an extreme risk score of 1 due to its velocity and unpredictable path relative to the Ego vehicle.
