Obstacle 30733 is in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle and is very close.  Its velocity is much lower than the ego vehicle's, meaning a collision is likely if the ego vehicle does not brake.

Obstacle 30726 is accelerating and changing lanes, and based on its trajectory and the ego vehicle's current speed, it might cut in front of the ego vehicle within the next couple of seconds.
