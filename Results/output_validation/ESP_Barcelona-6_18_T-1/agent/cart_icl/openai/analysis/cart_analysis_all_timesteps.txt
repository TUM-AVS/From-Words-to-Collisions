In this analysis, let's examine the most recent timestamp data (at 4.7 seconds) and identify any immediate risks for the ego vehicle based on proximity to obstacles and their trajectories.

### Evaluation of Obstacles at 4.7 Seconds:

1. **Obstacle 30718.0:**
   - **Position:** (-261.3032, -223.7711)
   - **Velocity:** 0.0 m/s (stationary)
   - **Proximity:** Safe distance from Ego
   - **Risk Assessment:** Low risk, not moving, far position.

2. **Obstacle 30722.0:**
   - **Position:** (-263.6594, -221.1842)
   - **Velocity:** 0.0 m/s (stationary)

   - **Velocity:** 5.6106 m/s
   - **Proximity:** Moderate distance but not on a collision path.
   - **Risk Assessment:** Medium risk due to relatively high speed, but no immediate collision risk.

4. **Obstacle 30732.0:**
   - **Position:** (-275.436, -222.4273)
   - **Velocity:** 4.8348 m/s
   - **Proximity:** Relatively close; however, trajectory doesn't indicate an impending collision path.
   - **Risk Assessment:** Medium risk due to speed nearing ego, but maintaining a trajectory away from immediate collision.

5. **Obstacle 30733.0:**
   - **Position:** (-266.9646, -228.9175)
   - **Velocity:** 0.1529 m/s
   - **Proximity:** Safe distance, low speed.
   - **Risk Assessment:** Low risk, moving slowly, relatively distant.

6. **Obstacle 30734.0:**
   - **Position:** (-269.4617, -226.4563)
   - **Velocity:** 0.3472 m/s
   - **Proximity:** Safe distance, low speed.
   - **Risk Assessment:** Low risk, not a threat.

7. **Obstacle 30735.0:**
   - **Position:** (-271.6173, -223.6852)
   - **Velocity:** 0.0691 m/s
   - **Proximity:** Safe distance, extremely slow.
   - **Risk Assessment:** Low risk, virtually stationary.

8. **Obstacle 30736.0:**
   - **Position:** (-283.9296, -230.1761)
   - **Velocity:** 4.2957 m/s
   - **Proximity:** Further from immediate collision path.
   - **Risk Assessment:** Medium risk due to speed, but path away from Ego.

9. **Obstacle 30737.0:**
   - **Position:** (-292.5197, -238.0312)
   - **Velocity:** 4.1187 m/s
   - **Proximity:** No collision path.
   - **Risk Assessment:** Low risk.

10. **Obstacle 30739.0:**
    - **Position:** (-277.4466, -228.9999)
    - **Velocity:** 0.3875 m/s
    - **Proximity:** Not immediate collision proximity.
    - **Risk Assessment:** Low risk.

11. **Obstacle 30740.0:**
    - **Position:** (-276.2023, -232.5989)
    - **Velocity:** 1.5009 m/s
    - **Proximity:** Moving but at a safe distance, slightly faster.
    - **Risk Assessment:** Low risk.

12. **Obstacle 30742.0:**
    - **Position:** (-301.3712, -246.15)
    - **Velocity:** 4.3415 m/s
    - **Proximity:** Safely distant with no immediate collision path.
    - **Risk Assessment:** Low risk.

13. **Obstacle 30744.0:**
    - **Position:** (-284.4124, -235.355)
    - **Velocity:** 1.7615 m/s
    - **Proximity:** Safe distance, slightly fast but not near ego.
    - **Risk Assessment:** Low risk.

14. **Obstacle 30746.0:**
    - **Position:** (-282.412, -243.0128)
    - **Velocity:** 3.6156 m/s
    - **Proximity:** Not on an immediate collision path.
    - **Risk Assessment:** Medium risk due to speed, but distant.

### Summary of Risks:
No obstacles are on an immediate collision path with the ego vehicle. Medium risks are seen due to relative speeds, however, no high or extreme risks are present.

```json
{
    "CollisionObstacles": [],
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null,
    "HighRiskObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "30726.0",
        "OverallRiskScore": 2
    }
}
```

In this instance, the closest risk level is Medium Risk, therefore no extreme or collision risks are recorded. The scenario remains manageable under current conditions.
