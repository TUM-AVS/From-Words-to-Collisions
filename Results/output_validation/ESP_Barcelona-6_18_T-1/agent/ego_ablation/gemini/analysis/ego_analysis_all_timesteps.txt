At timestamp 4.7 seconds, the following obstacles warrant attention due to their proximity and projected trajectories relative to the ego vehicle:

**Obstacle 30746 (Rear):** This obstacle poses the most significant risk. Its longitudinal distance is -0.59 meters, meaning it is very close to the ego vehicle's rear. The relative velocity indicates it is approaching the ego vehicle at 2.57 m/s.  Given the short distance, a collision is imminent.

**Obstacle 30740 (Front-Left):** At a longitudinal distance of 2.00 meters and a lateral distance of 1.89 meters, this obstacle is relatively close. It is moving away longitudinally at 0.46 m/s but there is no lateral movement.  The combined distance and moderate relative speed call for attention.

**Obstacle 30739 (Front-Left):** This obstacle is 3.51 meters ahead longitudinally and 5.38 meters to the left. It is moving towards the ego vehicle longitudinally (-0.66 m/s), but not laterally. This warrants observation but collision risk is moderate.

**Other Obstacles:** The remaining obstacles are farther away and/or have relative velocities that do not pose an immediate threat. They still need to be monitored but require no immediate action.
