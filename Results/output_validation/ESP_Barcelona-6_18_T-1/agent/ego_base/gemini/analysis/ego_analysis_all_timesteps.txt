Obstacle 30718: Low Risk (4).  Longitudinal distance is large (18.95m) and relative velocity indicates it is moving towards the ego vehicle slowly. No immediate risk.
Obstacle 30722: Low Risk (4). Similar to 30718 but slightly to the left.  Large longitudinal distance and slow relative velocity pose no immediate threat.
Obstacle 30723: Low Risk (4). Similar to 30722, but further to the left. No immediate concern due to distance and slow relative velocity.
Obstacle 30726: Low Risk (4). This obstacle is moving away longitudinally, decreasing risk. Lateral movement is not a concern at the current distance.
Obstacle 30732: Medium Risk (3).  Longitudinal distance is moderate (9.42m) and the obstacle is moving away. Needs monitoring but not immediate high risk.
Obstacle 30733: Medium Risk (3). Moderate longitudinal distance (11.30m) with slow closing velocity. Requires attention but not an immediate high risk.
Obstacle 30734: Medium Risk (3). Moderate longitudinal distance (11.12 m) and it's approaching slowly. Poses a potential risk if the trend continues.
Obstacle 30735: Medium Risk (3).  Moderate longitudinal distance (11.40m) with a slow closing velocity.  Requires monitoring.
Obstacle 30736: Medium Risk (3).  Laterally close (8.89m) but not directly ahead. Longitudinal velocity suggests it will remain to the side.
Obstacle 30737: Medium Risk (3).  Approaching from behind and slightly to the left. Moderate longitudinal distance. Requires monitoring.
Obstacle 30739: High Risk (2).  Very close longitudinally (3.51m) and approaching. Lateral distance provides some margin but requires immediate attention and potential action.
Obstacle 30740: High Risk (2). Very close longitudinally (2.00m) and although moving away slightly, requires immediate attention due to proximity.
Obstacle 30742: Low Risk (4).  Approaching from behind but at a large longitudinal distance. Not a concern at this point.
Obstacle 30744: Low Risk (4). To the side and not directly in the path. Longitudinal velocity indicates it's moving away. 
Obstacle 30746: Extreme Risk (1). Very close behind (0.59m) and rapidly approaching.  High risk of collision.

Risk Levels:
0: Collision - Physical contact occurred or unavoidable
1: Extreme Risk - Immediate collision likely
2: High Risk - Close to collision, needs quick action
3: Medium Risk - Manageable with proper reaction
4: Low Risk - Minimal risk, sufficient time to react
5: Negligible Risk - No significant risk
