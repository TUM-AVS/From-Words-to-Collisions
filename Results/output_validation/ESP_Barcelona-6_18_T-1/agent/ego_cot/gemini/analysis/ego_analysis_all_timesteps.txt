### Safety analysis for timestep 4.7s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

**Assumptions and Clarifications:**

* Since adjusted distances (adjusted_d_long, adjusted_d_lat) are not provided in the scenario context, I will use the provided real distances (DTClong, DTClat) for the analysis.  However, in a real-world application, you **must** use the adjusted distances for a more accurate safety assessment.
* I will assume a simplified TTC calculation: `TTC = Distance / Relative Velocity`. In reality, TTC calculation in autonomous driving is more complex and considers acceleration and non-linear trajectories.
* I will analyze risk based on both longitudinal and lateral distances and velocities, considering the relative direction of the obstacle.


### Obstacle Analysis:

**General Observations:** Obstacle 30746 poses the most immediate risk, as it is rapidly approaching the ego vehicle from behind and is less than 1 meter away. Obstacle 30739 is also a concern due to its proximity in the front-left.
