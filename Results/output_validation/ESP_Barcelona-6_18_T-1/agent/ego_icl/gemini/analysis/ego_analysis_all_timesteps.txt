* **Obstacle 30735:** Front-left, longitudinal 11.40m, lateral 5.38m. Relative longitudinal velocity -0.97 m/s.
    * Further to the left, approaching slowly. Low risk.
    * TTC Longitudinal: 11.40m / 0.97m/s = 11.75s
    * MDC: Not applicable
    * Risk: 5 (Negligible)

* **Obstacle 30736:** Left, longitudinal 0.00m, lateral 8.89m.
    * To the left of the ego, aligned longitudinally. Low risk.
    * TTC is not applicable due to longitudinal alignment.
    * MDC: Not applicable
    * Risk: 5 (Negligible)
