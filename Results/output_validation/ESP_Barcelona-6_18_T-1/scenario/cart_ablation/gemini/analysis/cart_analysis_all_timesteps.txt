Here's the collision risk analysis for the provided scenario:

**Analysis (Focusing on the last timestamp - 4.9 seconds):**

The ego vehicle's position is (-278.4953, -239.4295) at 4.9 seconds.  We examine the positions and trajectories of other obstacles at this final timestep to assess the most immediate risk.

* **Obstacle 30733:** This obstacle is in the same lanelet (3034) as the ego vehicle, at position (-266.9449, -228.8995). Although it is somewhat close, its velocity is decreasing (0.1229 and decelerating), and the ego vehicle is also moving forward. This warrants attention but does not represent an extreme risk. Risk score: 3 (Medium Risk)

* **Obstacle 30739:** This obstacle is located at (-277.394, -228.9519) in lanelet 3032. It's near the ego vehicle laterally and slightly ahead longitudinally. Given the ego vehicle's trajectory and this obstacle's slow speed (0.3326 and decelerating), a collision is unlikely. Risk score: 3 (Medium Risk).

No other obstacles appear to pose an immediate collision risk at the 4.9-second mark. The scenario information does not provide object dimensions, making precise collision calculation impossible.  However, based on positions and trajectories, an immediate collision appears unlikely with any obstacle.
