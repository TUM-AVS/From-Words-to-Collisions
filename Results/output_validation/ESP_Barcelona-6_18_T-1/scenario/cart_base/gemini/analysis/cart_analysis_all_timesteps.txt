At t=4.9s, Ego (30738.0) is in lanelet 3034.0 at (-278.4953, -239.4295) with a velocity of 1.0434 m/s.  Obstacle 30733.0 is also in lanelet 3034.0 at (-266.9449, -228.8995) with a velocity of 0.1229 m/s. The distance between them is approximately 11.7 meters. Given their velocities and decelerations from preceding timesteps, a collision is not imminent in the next immediate timestep, but the risk is high due to their shared lanelet and closing distance. Obstacle 30733.0 shows a decelerating trend.
