- Obstacle ID: 30726.0
- Distance Risk reason:  While initially far, this obstacle has consistently moved closer to the ego vehicle over the timesteps and is in a different lanelet.  Although its trajectory doesn't directly intersect with the ego vehicle's current path, given its speed and changing orientation, it presents a potential risk if it were to change lanes or the ego vehicle deviated from its course.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason:  High velocity and positive acceleration might lead to a rapid approach. Requires monitoring.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- Obstacle ID: 30732.0
- Distance Risk reason: In a different lanelet and a safe lateral distance away, but closing in longitudinally.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason:  Moving at a substantial speed and with positive acceleration. Needs attention.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4


- Obstacle ID: 30733.0
- Distance Risk reason: Located in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle but further down the road and maintains separation. Decreasing speed makes a collision in near future unlikely, however ego vehicle should take caution.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Low velocity and negative acceleration suggests it's slowing down or coming to a stop, further reducing risk.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4


- Obstacle ID: 30734.0
- Distance Risk reason: In adjacent lanelet and at safe distance from ego vehicle. Its decreasing speed and negative acceleration indicate that collision is unlikely in near future.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Low velocity and negative acceleration means less immediate risk.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- Obstacle ID: 30735.0
- Distance Risk reason:  In adjacent lanelet and at safe distance from ego vehicle. No observed risk over the past timesteps due to slow speed and negative acceleration.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Very low velocity and negative acceleration suggest it poses minimal risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 30736.0
- Distance Risk reason: In adjacent lanelet and a safe lateral distance away, closing in longitudinally with a relatively high speed. 
- Distance safety score: 4

- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- Obstacle ID: 30737.0
- Distance Risk reason: In different lane and far away from ego. No significant risk observed over past timesteps.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Although moving at a moderate speed, its distance and trajectory do not indicate an immediate risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 30739.0
- Distance Risk reason: In adjacent lanelet and a safe lateral distance away. Its slowing trend and negative acceleration indicate a decreasing risk over time.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Low velocity and decelerating, reducing the risk.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- Obstacle ID: 30740.0
- Distance Risk reason: In adjacent lanelet and a safe distance from ego vehicle. Slowing trend and negative acceleration makes collision less likely.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Moderate velocity and significant negative acceleration suggesting it's slowing down significantly.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- Obstacle ID: 30742.0
- Distance Risk reason:  In different lane and far away from ego. No risk observed over past timesteps.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason:  Moving at a moderate speed, but its distance and trajectory do not indicate an immediate risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 30744.0
- Distance Risk reason: In adjacent lanelet and safe lateral distance from ego. Decelerating movement observed over the past timesteps.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Moderate velocity but decelerating suggests reduced risk over time.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- Obstacle ID: 30746.0
- Distance Risk reason: In a different lane and moderately far from ego. No immediate risk observed over the past timesteps.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Relatively high velocity, but its distance and trajectory currently do not pose a direct threat. Strong deceleration reduces risk over time.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4


### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:

1. **Most critical obstacles:** Obstacle 30733.0 is in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle, requiring close monitoring. Obstacles 30726.0 and 30732.0, while in different lanelets, have been getting relatively close.
2. **Trajectory analysis:** Over the 10 timesteps, Obstacle 30733.0 is slowly catching up to the ego vehicle.
3. **Relative position, velocity, acceleration:** Obstacle 30733.0 maintains a safe distance, has a decreasing velocity, and is negatively accelerating. Obstacle 30726.0 is moving at high velocity and positive acceleration towards the ego vehicle. Other obstacles pose no immediate risks.
4. **Collision determination:** No collision has occurred or is imminent in the analyzed time frame.
5. **Reasoning:**  While some obstacles are moderately close and/or moving at high velocities, their trajectories and lanelets don't create an immediate collision risk. The fact that some obstacles are slowing down, and no obstacle is in a position to immediately collide, suggests the overall risk is manageable.

### Summary in JSON Format:

```json
{
  "CollisionObstacles": null,
  "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null,
  "ScenarioAnalysis": {
    "IsCollisionScenario": false,
    "Reasoning": "No obstacle is on a direct collision course with the ego vehicle within the analyzed timeframe. While some obstacles are in relative proximity, their trajectories, speeds, and accelerations suggest that collisions are not imminent.  The situation requires continued monitoring but is not currently a collision scenario."
