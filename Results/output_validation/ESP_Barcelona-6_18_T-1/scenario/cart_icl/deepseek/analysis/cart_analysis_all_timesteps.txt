### Safety Analysis for the Most Recent Timestep (4.9 seconds):

#### Key Observations:
1. **Ego Vehicle**: 
   - Position: (-278.4953, -239.4295)
   - Velocity: 1.0434 m/s (slow)
   - Lanelet: 3034.0

2. **Obstacle Analysis**:
   - Most obstacles are either stationary or moving away from the ego vehicle's path.
   - No obstacles are in the same lanelet as the ego (3034.0) except obstacle 30733.0, which is moving very slowly (0.1229 m/s) and decelerating.
   - The closest dynamic obstacles (30725.0, 30726.0) are in adjacent lanelets and moving parallel or away from the ego's trajectory.

#### Critical Obstacles:
- **30733.0**: 
  - Same lanelet as ego (3034.0), but moving at 0.1229 m/s with deceleration (-0.1625 m/s²). 
  - Distance: ~10.6m from ego, closing very slowly (TTC > 80s → negligible risk).

- **30725.0**: 
  - High speed (8.8874 m/s) but in lanelet 1437.0 (not intersecting ego's path).
  - Moving away from ego's position.

### JSON Summary:
```json
{
    "CollisionObstacles": null,
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null,
    "ScenarioAnalysis": {
        "IsCollisionScenario": false,
        "Reasoning": "No obstacles are on a collision course with the ego vehicle. The closest dynamic obstacles are either stationary, moving away, or in non-conflicting lanelets. The only obstacle in the same lanelet (30733.0) poses negligible risk due to extremely low velocity and deceleration."
    }
}
```

### Notes:
- **TTC/MDC Calculations**: Not shown for brevity, but all TTC values were >> 5s (low risk threshold).
- **Historical Context**: Obstacle trajectories over the last 9 timesteps confirm consistent non-conflicting paths.
- **Prioritization**: Focused on JSON output as instructed, with minimal analysis to ensure completeness.
