### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
- The scenario involves multiple obstacles with varying velocities and traâ€‹jectories; however, none pose an immediate threat to an impending collision with the ego vehicle based on their distance and speed.
- Obstacles with similar lanelet to ego have low velocities and are moving away or in divergent paths, negating any significant collision risks.
- Thus, this analysis concludes as a non-collision scenario.
