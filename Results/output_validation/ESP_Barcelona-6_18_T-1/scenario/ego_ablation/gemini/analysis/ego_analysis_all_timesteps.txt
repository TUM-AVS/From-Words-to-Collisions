Obstacle 30746 is behind the ego vehicle at a very close longitudinal distance of -0.12 meters, indicating an extremely high risk of collision. While the relative velocity suggests the obstacle is moving away longitudinally (2.30 m/s), the close proximity and negative longitudinal distance suggest a likely collision, especially given the possibility of sensor noise or slight deviations in trajectory.  Obstacle 30740 is in front of the ego vehicle and to the left, at a longitudinal distance of 2.07 m and a lateral distance of 1.89 m. The relative longitudinal velocity is 0.28 m/s, and the obstacle is moving away from the ego car longitudinally. Therefore, although this obstacle shows some risk, it is less risky than obstacle 30746. Obstacle 30739 is also to the front left of the ego vehicle, at a distance of 3.37m longitudinally and 5.38m laterally.  It has a relative longitudinal velocity of -0.71 m/s moving towards the ego vehicle. This represents a medium risk.
