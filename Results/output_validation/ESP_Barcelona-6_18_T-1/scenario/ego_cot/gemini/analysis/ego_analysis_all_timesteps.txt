...(Similar analysis repeated for each timestamp 4.1s - 4.9s. Note the change in Obstacle 30746 distance/risk at timestamps after collision at 4.9 seconds.)

**Detailed Reasoning for Collision Scenario:**

Obstacle 30746 starts close behind the ego vehicle and continues to approach rapidly. By time 4.9s, its longitudinal distance becomes -0.12m, indicating a rear-end collision.  The negative distance values after the collision point confirm the impact. Obstacle 30739 is consistently very close to the ego vehicle, with a decreasing longitudinal distance and although it does not collide in the time evaluated, the proximity represents an extreme risk that requires immediate action to avoid a collision.
