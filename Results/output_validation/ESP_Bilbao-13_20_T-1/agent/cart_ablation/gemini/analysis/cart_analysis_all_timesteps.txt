Analysis:

Ego vehicle (ID: 30796) is traveling at a slow speed and decelerating.  We need to analyze the trajectories of other vehicles relative to Ego to assess collision risks.

Obstacle 30798: This obstacle is in a different lanelet (40) and moving away from the Ego vehicle. Negligible risk.

Obstacle 30800: This obstacle is in a different lanelet (367) and far from the Ego vehicle.  Negligible risk.

Obstacle 30801: This obstacle is in the same lanelet (705) as Ego and its x and y positions are getting closer to Ego's. The obstacle is also accelerating, while the Ego vehicle is decelerating. This presents a potential collision risk. Although the data provided does not include size information for the vehicles, the proximity and closing velocities over the next few timesteps clearly put this at Extreme Risk. 

Obstacle 30802: This obstacle is in a different lanelet (367) and stationary, posing no immediate threat.  Negligible risk.

Obstacle 30804: This obstacle starts in lanelet 706, close to the Ego vehicle in 705.  It is traveling considerably faster and accelerating, but the lane change into lanelet 1513 indicates a diverging trajectory, lowering the risk. Medium risk.

Obstacle 30805: This obstacle is in the same lanelet (705) as Ego, but sufficiently far ahead. Although the speeds are getting closer, the distance and trends suggest Low Risk.

Obstacle 30806: This obstacle in lanelet 706 is also accelerating, but it's moving away from the Ego vehicle. Low risk.

Obstacle 30807:  First appears at 1.9s and is far enough away to be negligible risk, given the relative speeds.
