Obstacle 30798 is in a different lanelet (40) and its y-coordinate is significantly different from the ego vehicle, indicating no immediate risk. It maintains a high velocity and acceleration, moving further away. Risk score: 5

Obstacle 30800 is in a different lanelet (367) and its y-coordinate is also different from the ego vehicle. Its velocity is close to zero and it's not moving significantly. Risk score: 5

Obstacle 30801 is in the same lanelet (705) as the ego vehicle. Its x and y coordinates are close to the ego vehicle. It accelerates towards the ego vehicle, but its x-coordinate is getting further away from the ego vehicle, which suggests that they are not on a collision course. Risk score: 4

Obstacle 30802 is in a different lanelet (367) and its y-coordinate is also different from the ego vehicle. Its velocity and acceleration are both zero, posing no risk. Risk score: 5

Obstacle 30804 is initially in a different lanelet (706) and close to the ego vehicle, but it transitions to lanelet 1513 later on. While its x-coordinate shows it moving closer to the ego vehicle at first, when it transitions to 1513 it is not moving closer at the later timesteps. Thus, it is not considered a risk. Risk score: 3

Obstacle 30805 is in the same lanelet (705) as the ego vehicle. Its x and y coordinates are relatively close to the ego vehicle at the start and its x-coordinate is getting further away from the ego vehicle, which suggest that there is no collision risk. Risk score: 4

Obstacle 30806 is initially in lanelet 706, close to the ego vehicle. Its x and y coordinates show some proximity. Given its higher velocity and acceleration towards the ego vehicle, it is a medium risk. Risk score: 3

Obstacle 30807 appears later in the scenario in lanelet 705 and is relatively far from the ego vehicle, posing no immediate risk. Risk score: 5
