### Analysis:

Based on the data, no obstacle is assessed as having an Overall Risk Score of 0 or 1 (Collision or Extreme Risk). Here are some noteworthy considerations for the highest risks observed:

1. **Obstacle 30801.0**:
   - **Position and Speed**: It remains consistently in the same lanelet as the Ego vehicle (705.0) and has shown consistent acceleration over the timesteps.
   - **Risk Analysis**: Despite being in the same lanelet, the obstacle is at a distance with velocity heading towards increasing separation from Ego. Thus, the risk is not extreme but still demands awareness due to its potential trajectory towards the Ego car.
   - **Overall Risk Assessment**: Medium Risk due to its relative close proximity and similar lanelet.

2. **Obstacle 30806.0**:
   - **Position and Speed**: It is moving towards a position slightly intersecting with the Ego vehicle's path but in a separate lanelet (706.0).
   - **Risk Analysis**: The significant velocity and acceleration imply it is moving faster than the Ego vehicle, which potentially may not converge on a collision course immediately; however, its motion dynamics require monitoring.
   - **Overall Risk Assessment**: Medium Risk due to the rapid changes in speed and intersection path trends nearby.

### Structured JSON Output:

```json
{
    "CollisionObstacles": [],
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null,
    "HighRiskObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "30801.0",
        "OverallRiskScore": 2
    }
}
```

This JSON output shows that while there's no immediate collision or extreme risk scenario, there are obstacles like 30801.0 that have enough potential risk requiring close attention. Note that the JSON adheres to the prescribed format and is valid.
