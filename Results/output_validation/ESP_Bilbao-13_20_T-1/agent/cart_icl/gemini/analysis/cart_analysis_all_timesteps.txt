At timestep 2.0s, obstacle 30801 is in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle and its longitudinal velocity is increasing relative to the ego vehicle, indicating a potential collision risk. However, the data provided doesn't give enough information to determine lateral movement or precise TTC, so we cannot definitively categorize it as "Extreme Risk".  Obstacle 30804 is moving quickly, but not in the ego vehicle's lanelet, so it does not pose a collision risk.
