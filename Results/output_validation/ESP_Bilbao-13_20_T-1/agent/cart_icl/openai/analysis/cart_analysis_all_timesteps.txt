To evaluate the risk level for each obstacle with respect to the ego vehicle, I'll focus on relative positions, velocities, orientation, and lanelet locations at the most recent timestamp (2.0 seconds), using the motion trends from previous timestamps to inform the assessment.

### Analysis of Most Recent Timestep (2.0 seconds):

1. **Ego Vehicle (ID: 30796.0)**:
   - Position: (-415.2205, -208.0393), Orientation: -2.3889, Velocity: 0.2494 m/s

2. **Obstacle 30801.0**:
   - Position: (-411.7982, -203.9374)
   - Velocity: 3.1979 m/s, approaching ego with a relatively high speed.
   - Sharing same lanelet (705.0), close proximity and similar trajectory.
   - **Risk Assessment**: Medium to High (possibly can escalate soon), as the position and close velocity similarity imply an increasingly close minimum distance.

3. **Obstacle 30804.0**:
   - Position: (-421.7825, -209.7361)
   - Velocity: 9.4888 m/s
   - In different lanelet (1513.0), lateral separation observed indicates no immediate collision risk with Ego.
   - **Risk Assessment**: Low Risk (4)

4. **Obstacle 30806.0**:
   - Position: (-411.689, -198.3819)
   - Velocity: 8.5065 m/s
   - Present in a different lanelet (706.0), higher lateral separation, though fast-moving.
   - **Risk Assessment**: Negligible Risk (5)

5. **Obstacle 30807.0**:
   - Position: (-396.7549, -185.2196)
   - Velocity: 4.5304 m/s
   - Present in the same lanelet (705.0), but a considerable distance away.
   - **Risk Assessment**: Low Risk (4)

Given that the focus should be on obstacles posing immediate risk:

- **Key Finding**:
  - No obstacle presents an unavoidable collision or extreme risk at the latest timestamp. However, some show medium to high risk close to collision conditions (Obstacle 30801.0).

The JSON output represents the summarized risks:

```json
{
    "CollisionObstacles": [],
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null,
    "HighRiskObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "30801.0",
        "OverallRiskScore": 2
    }
}
