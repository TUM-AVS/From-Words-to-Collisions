At t=2.0s:
- **Obstacle 30800**: Located front-right, longitudinally 13.02m and laterally -17.52m. Moving slowly towards the ego vehicle both longitudinally and laterally.  Poses a low risk (4 or 5) due to the significant distance.

- **Obstacle 30801**: Located behind, longitudinally -0.79m and laterally 0m.  Moving towards the ego vehicle from behind at 2.93 m/s. This is very close and represents a **high risk (2)** of collision.

- **Obstacle 30802**: Located front-right, longitudinally 10.29m and laterally -10.50m. Moving slowly towards the ego vehicle longitudinally.  Low risk (4 or 5) due to distance.

- **Obstacle 30804**: Located front-right, longitudinally 1.44m and laterally -1.64m. Moving away longitudinally at 9.24 m/s but slightly towards the ego vehicle laterally. The longitudinal velocity suggests it may be passing quickly, and lateral movement needs monitoring, making this a medium risk (3).

- **Obstacle 30805**: Located rear-right, longitudinally -11.96m and laterally -0.38m. Moving towards the ego vehicle from behind. Low to medium risk (3 or 4) given the distance and moderate closing velocity.

- **Obstacle 30806**: Located rear-right, longitudinally -4.67m and laterally -3.02m. Approaching quickly from behind at 8.20 m/s.  This poses a **high risk (2)** of collision.

- **Obstacle 30807**: Located rear-right, longitudinally -24.57m and laterally -2.42m. Moving towards the ego vehicle from behind.  Low risk (4 or 5) due to the distance.


Risk Levels:
0: Collision - Physical contact occurred or unavoidable
1: Extreme Risk - Immediate collision likely
2: High Risk - Close to collision, needs quick action
3: Medium Risk - Manageable with proper reaction
4: Low Risk - Minimal risk, sufficient time to react
5: Negligible Risk - No significant risk
