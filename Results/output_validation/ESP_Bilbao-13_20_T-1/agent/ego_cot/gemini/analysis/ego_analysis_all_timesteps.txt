### Safety analysis for timestep 2.0s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

**Assumptions and Calculations:**

* **Adjusted Distance:**  Since no vehicle sizes are provided, I'm assuming the provided longitudinal and lateral distances are already adjusted for vehicle size (i.e., represent the distances between the edges of the vehicles). If this is not the case, the analysis needs to be redone with proper adjustments.
* **TTC Calculation:** TTC is calculated by dividing the distance to the obstacle by the relative velocity.  Negative TTC values indicate the obstacle is moving away (or has already passed and continues in motion away from the ego).  A TTC close to zero is very dangerous.
* **MDC Calculation:** In this scenario, MDC is the minimum real distance between vehicles as provided in the scenario description.
* **Overall Risk Score:** Based on the lowest obtained safety score of TTC and distance scores.

### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 30800**
    - Distance Risk reason:  Located at 13.02m longitudinally and 13.02m laterally in the front-right.  Poses no immediate risk.
    - Distance safety score: 5
    - Time Risk reason: Negative longitudinal relative velocity implies moving away.  No collision risk.
    - Time safety score: 5
    - Overall Risk score: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 30801**
    - Distance Risk reason:  Located at -0.79m longitudinally and -0.79m laterally (behind), indicating very high proximity.
    - Distance safety score: 1
    - Time Risk reason: Positive Longitudinal relative velocity and distance <1m implies a very likely and imminent collision risk.
    - Time safety score: 1
    - Overall Risk score: 1

- **Obstacle ID: 30802**
    - Distance Risk reason:  Located at 10.29m longitudinally and 10.29m laterally in the front-right, posing no immediate risk.
    - Distance safety score: 5
    - Time Risk reason: Negative longitudinal relative velocity implies moving away.  No collision risk.
    - Time safety score: 5
    - Overall Risk score: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 30804**
    - Distance Risk reason: Located at 1.44m longitudinally and 1.44m laterally in front-right, indicating high proximity.
    - Distance safety score: 2
    - Time Risk reason: Positive longitudinal relative velocity, indicates a potential for collision although some time to react is still present due to a larger distance compared to obstacle 30801.
    - Time safety score: 2
    - Overall Risk score: 2


- **Obstacle ID: 30805**
    - Distance Risk reason: Located at -11.96m longitudinally and -11.96m laterally (behind), posing no immediate risk.
    - Distance safety score: 5
    - Time Risk reason:  Though approaching from behind longitudinally, the distance and the time to react are sufficient to handle such movement if the trajectory continues in the future.
    - Time safety score: 5
    - Overall Risk score: 5


- **Obstacle ID: 30806**
    - Distance Risk reason: Located at -4.67m longitudinally and -4.67m laterally (behind), indicating moderate proximity.
    - Distance safety score: 4
    - Time Risk reason:  Though approaching from behind longitudinally, the distance and time to react are sufficient.
    - Time safety score: 4
    - Overall Risk score: 4


- **Obstacle ID: 30807**
    - Distance Risk reason: Located at -24.57m longitudinally and -24.57m laterally (behind), posing no immediate risk.
    - Distance safety score: 5
    - Time Risk reason: Though approaching from behind, significant distance and time to react are available.
    - Time safety score: 5
    - Overall Risk score: 5
