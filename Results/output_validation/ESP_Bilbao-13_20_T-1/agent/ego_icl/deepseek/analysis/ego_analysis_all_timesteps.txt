Let me analyze the obstacles at the most recent timestep (2.0 seconds) and their trajectories:

1. Obstacle 30800 (Front-right):
   - Longitudinal: 13.02m (approaching at -0.26m/s)
   - Lateral: -17.52m (approaching at 0.03m/s)
   - Both distances are large and closing speeds are extremely slow
   - MDC > 5m in both dimensions
   - Risk: 5 (Negligible)

2. Obstacle 30801 (Behind):
   - Longitudinal: -0.79m (approaching at 2.93m/s)
   - Lateral: 0.00m (exact alignment)
   - TTC = 0.79/2.93 = 0.27s (Extreme Risk)
   - MDC = 0.79m (High Risk)
   - Risk: 1 (Extreme) due to very short TTC

3. Obstacle 30802 (Front-right):
   - Longitudinal: 10.29m (approaching at -0.25m/s)
   - Lateral: -10.50m (no motion)
   - Both distances > 5m
   - Risk: 5 (Negligible)

4. Obstacle 30804 (Front-right):
   - Longitudinal: 1.44m (moving away at 9.24m/s)
   - Lateral: -1.64m (approaching at 0.08m/s)
   - MDC = min(1.44,1.64) = 1.44m (Medium Risk)
   - But moving away longitudinally
   - Risk: 4 (Low)

5. Obstacle 30805 (Rear-right):
   - Longitudinal: -11.96m (approaching at 3.17m/s)
   - Lateral: -0.38m (approaching at 0.43m/s)
   - TTC longitudinal = 11.96/3.17 = 3.77s (Low Risk)
   - MDC > 0.38m (Low Risk)
   - Risk: 4 (Low)

6. Obstacle 30806 (Rear-right):
   - Longitudinal: -4.67m (approaching at 8.20m/s)
   - Lateral: -3.02m (approaching at 1.01m/s)
   - TTC longitudinal = 4.67/8.20 = 0.57s (High Risk)
   - MDC > 3.02m (Low Risk)
   - Risk: 2 (High)

7. Obstacle 30807 (Rear-right):
   - Longitudinal: -24.57m (approaching at 4.19m/s)
   - Lateral: -2.42m (approaching at 0.92m/s)
   - Both distances large
   - Risk: 5 (Negligible)

Trajectory Analysis:
- Obstacle 30801 is the most critical, approaching from behind with exact lateral alignment and very short TTC (0.27s)
- Obstacle 30806 also concerning but further away
- No current collision but 30801 is imminent extreme risk
