**Trajectory Analysis and Risk Assessment:**

1. **Obstacle 30800:**
   - **Position & Movement:** Front-right, longitudinal 13.02m, lateral -17.52m. Approaching longitudinally.
   - **Relative Velocity & Acceleration:** Longitudinal velocity: -0.26 m/s (toward), lateral velocity: 0.03 m/s (toward).
   - **Trajectory Change:** The longitudinal distance increases slightly, suggesting slowing convergence.
   - **Calculations:**
     - **TTC (Longitudinal):** Not applicable as relative velocity is low and not a fast closing gap.
     - **MDC:** Longitudinal distance is reasonable, maintaining separation.
   - **Risk Assessment:** Low risk (4). Paths converge slowly without immediate risk.

2. **Obstacle 30801:**
   - **Position & Movement:** Behind, longitudinal -0.79m, lateral 0.00m. Direct alignment, moving toward.
   - **Relative Velocity & Acceleration:** Longitudinal velocity: 2.93 m/s (closing), lateral velocity near 0 m/s.
   - **Trajectory Change:** Continuously moving closer.
   - **Calculations:**
     - **TTC (Longitudinal):** TTC ≈ |-0.79| / 2.93 = 0.27 seconds.
     - **MDC:** Extremely small, indicating imminent convergence.
   - **Risk Assessment:** Extreme risk (1). Rapid convergence with lateral and longitudinal alignments.

3. **Obstacle 30802:**
   - **Position & Movement:** Front-right, longitudinal 10.29m, lateral -10.50m, steady approach.
   - **Relative Velocity & Acceleration:** Longitudinal velocity: -0.25 m/s, lateral velocity constant.
   - **Trajectory Change:** Paths show slow but steady approach.
   - **Calculations:**
     - **TTC:** Not directly applicable due to minimal closing velocity.
     - **MDC:** Reasonable separation maintained longitudinally.
   - **Risk Assessment:** Low risk (4). Proximity stable, paths managed easily.

4. **Obstacle 30804:**
   - **Position & Movement:** Right, close lateral distance (-1.64m), moving away.
   - **Relative Velocity & Acceleration:** Longitudinal velocity: 9.24 m/s (away), lateral change decreasing risk.
   - **Trajectory Change:** Moving away laterally and longitudinally.
   - **Calculations:**
     - **TTC & MDC:** Not critical as motions are largely diverging.
   - **Risk Assessment:** Negligible risk (5). Significant diverging pattern.

5. **Obstacle 30805:**
   - **Position & Movement:** Behind right, longitudinal -11.96m, lateral -0.38m.
   - **Relative Velocity & Acceleration:** Longitudinal velocity 3.17 m/s (toward), lateral velocity toward ego.
   - **Trajectory Change:** Slow convergence.
   - **Calculations:**
     - **TTC:** Not critical as lateral aligns but far in rear.
     - **MDC:** Maintained separation so far.
   - **Risk Assessment:** Medium risk (3). Paths converge, with time to react.

6. **Obstacle 30806:**
   - **Position & Movement:** Rear-right, longitudinal -4.67m, lateral -3.02m.
   - **Relative Velocity & Acceleration:** Longitudinal velocity of 8.20 m/s (closing fast).
   - **Trajectory Change:** Fast movement toward ego.
   - **Calculations:**
     - **TTC (Longitudinal):** |-4.67| / 8.20 ≈ 0.57 seconds.
     - **MDC:** Very close proximity.
   - **Risk Assessment:** High risk (2). Quick convergence poses potential disruption.

7. **Obstacle 30807:**
   - **Position & Movement:** Rear-right, but fairly distant.
   - **Relative Velocity & Acceleration:** Closing, but over longer longitudinal distance.
   - **Trajectory Change:** Rate of convergence low.
   - **Risk Assessment:** Low to negligible risk (4).
