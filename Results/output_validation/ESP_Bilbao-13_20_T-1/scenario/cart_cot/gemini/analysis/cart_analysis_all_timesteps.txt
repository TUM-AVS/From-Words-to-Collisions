### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

- Obstacle ID: 30798.0
- Distance Risk reason: Located in a different lanelet (40.0) than the ego vehicle (705.0), and its y-coordinate is significantly different, indicating lateral separation. The historical trajectory confirms it's moving away from the ego vehicle.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason:  Moving away from the ego vehicle with increasing velocity. The historical data shows a consistent trend of increasing distance.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 30800.0
- Distance Risk reason: Located in a different lanelet (367.0). While the y-coordinates are relatively close, the x-coordinate difference and separate lanelets suggest a safe lateral distance.  The historical data supports this.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Nearly stationary and poses no immediate threat.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 4

- Obstacle ID: 30801.0
- Distance Risk reason: In the same lanelet (705.0) and  x and y coordinates indicate proximity. History shows it is approaching.
- Distance safety score: 2
- Time Risk reason: Velocity is increasing, and getting closer to ego vehicle over the timesteps, indicating potential for collision if the trend continues.
- Time safety score: 2
- Overall Risk score: 2

- Obstacle ID: 30802.0
- Distance Risk reason: Located in a different lanelet (367.0) and its x-coordinate suggests sufficient lateral separation.  History confirms no change in position.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Stationary.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 4

- Obstacle ID: 30804.0
- Distance Risk reason: Initially in a close lanelet (706.0), but transitioned to lanelet 1513.0. The y-coordinate separation and lane change, combined with historical data, indicate moderate risk.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: Moving relatively fast, but its trajectory and lane change suggest it is diverging from the ego vehicle's path, though caution is warranted.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3

- Obstacle ID: 30805.0
- Distance Risk reason: Located in the same lanelet (705.0) and the x and y coordinates are relatively close but safe for now. The history shows it's consistently somewhat close.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Its velocity has fluctuated, and while currently close, the overall trajectory based on history doesn't indicate an immediate collision risk.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- Obstacle ID: 30806.0
- Distance Risk reason: In a close lanelet (706.0), but the y-coordinate separation suggests moderate lateral safety. The history reinforces this assessment.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: Traveling at a relatively high speed, increasing over time. While not directly in the ego vehicle's path, the speed and proximity warrant attention.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3

- Obstacle ID: 30807.0
- Distance Risk reason:  In the same lanelet (705.0) but appeared later in the scenario. Currently, its x-coordinate indicates a safe distance.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Moderate velocity, and just appeared - need more history for better assessment.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4


### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:

1. **Most critical obstacles:** Obstacle 30801.0 poses the highest risk due to its proximity, same lanelet as ego vehicle, and increasing velocity towards the ego vehicle.

2. **Trajectory analysis:** Over the 10 timesteps, 30801.0 consistently approaches the ego vehicle. Other obstacles either remain in different lanelets, maintain safe distances, or change lanes.

3. **Relative position, velocity, and acceleration:**  Obstacle 30801.0 shows the most concerning trend, with decreasing distance and increasing velocity relative to the ego vehicle.

4. **Collision determination:**  While no collision has occurred yet, if the current trend continues, a collision with Obstacle 30801.0 is highly likely in the near future.

5. **Reasoning:**  The combination of proximity, same-lane occupancy, and the consistent trend of decreasing distance and increasing relative velocity between the ego vehicle and Obstacle 30801.0 strongly suggests a high risk of collision.

{
  "CollisionObstacles": [],
  "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null,
  "ScenarioAnalysis": {
    "IsCollisionScenario": false,
    "Reasoning": "Although Obstacle 30801.0 presents a high risk due to proximity, same lane, and increasing relative velocity, no actual collision has occurred within the provided timeframe. The scenario requires close monitoring and evasive action, but as of the last timestep, it's not yet classified as a collision scenario."
