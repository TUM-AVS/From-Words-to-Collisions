### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. **Obstacle Proximity**: No obstacles are in immediate collision course with the ego vehicle.
2. **Trajectory Analysis**: All obstacles are either moving away or at a safe distance.
3. **Velocity/Acceleration**: No extreme velocities or accelerations posing immediate threat.
4. **Lanelet Overlap**: Only minor overlaps with manageable risks (e.g., 30801.0, 30805.0, 30807.0).
