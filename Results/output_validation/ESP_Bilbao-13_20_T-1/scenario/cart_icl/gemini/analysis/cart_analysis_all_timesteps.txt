### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 30798.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is in a different lanelet and far away.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Moving away from ego.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 30800.0
- Distance Risk reason: In a different lanelet and poses no immediate threat.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Almost stationary. No imminent risk from its velocity.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 30801.0
- Distance Risk reason:  In the same lanelet and approaching the ego vehicle. Position history shows consistent movement towards the ego vehicle.
- Distance safety score: 2
- Time Risk reason: Accelerating towards the ego vehicle based on historical data. Velocity and acceleration suggest a high probability of getting closer.
- Time safety score: 2
- Overall Risk score: 2

- Obstacle ID: 30802.0
- Distance Risk reason: In a different lanelet and poses no immediate threat.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Stationary.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 30804.0
- Distance Risk reason: In a different lanelet now, but was previously close and approaching the ego vehicle in previous timesteps.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Although in a different lanelet, its high velocity and acceleration historically suggests potential risk if it were to return to the ego's lanelet.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3

- Obstacle ID: 30805.0
- Distance Risk reason: In the same lanelet, but sufficiently far ahead.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Moving at a moderate speed, with fluctuating acceleration, making its future trajectory somewhat less predictable.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- Obstacle ID: 30806.0
- Distance Risk reason: In a different lanelet, but proximity and history require monitoring.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Increasing velocity, but currently in adjacent lanelet and slightly behind.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- Obstacle ID: 30807.0
- Distance Risk reason: In the same lanelet, but sufficiently far behind.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason:  Moderate speed and recent entry.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5


### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
No immediate collision is detected at this timestep. However, obstacle 30801.0 poses a high risk due to its proximity, acceleration, and location in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle. While not an immediate collision, the current trajectory suggests a high likelihood of collision if evasive maneuvers are not taken. Obstacle 30804 is also a concern given its prior proximity.

### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
  "CollisionObstacles": [],
  "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null,
  "ScenarioAnalysis": {
    "IsCollisionScenario": false,
    "Reasoning": "No obstacle has a risk score of 0 indicating immediate collision. Obstacle 30801 has a risk score of 2, classifying it as high risk but not an immediate collision."
  }
}
