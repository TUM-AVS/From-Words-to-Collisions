### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep:

Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations for the timestamp 2.2 seconds:

#### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 30800**
  - **Distance Risk reason:** The obstacle is in a different lanelet, is stationary, and has minimal velocity, posing no immediate threat. Historical data shows negligible changes in position.
  - **Distance safety score:** 5
  - **Time Risk reason:** Very low velocity and no acceleration suggest it remains stationary, with no risk of collision due to invariability over time.
  - **Time safety score:** 5
  - **Overall Risk score:** 5

- **Obstacle ID: 30801**
  - **Distance Risk reason:** The obstacle is in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle but maintains a substantial distance. Continuously moving away from the ego over time.
  - **Distance safety score:** 4
  - **Time Risk reason:** Positive velocity and acceleration indicate a continuous movement away from the ego, reducing likelihood of collision.
  - **Time safety score:** 4
  - **Overall Risk score:** 4

- **Obstacle ID: 30802**
  - **Distance Risk reason:** Stationary at a different lanelet with no change in position across the timeframe. No threat posed.
  - **Distance safety score:** 5
  - **Time Risk reason:** No movement or acceleration detected over the observed duration, suggesting no future movement risk.
  - **Time safety score:** 5
  - **Overall Risk score:** 5

- **Obstacle ID: 30804**
  - **Distance Risk reason:** Positioned several lanes apart, moving consistently away from the ego, has increased velocity.
  - **Distance safety score:** 5
  - **Time Risk reason:** Trajectory and velocity indicate a continuing path away from the ego, insignificant threat posed.
  - **Time safety score:** 5
  - **Overall Risk score:** 5
 
- **Obstacle ID: 30805**
  - **Distance Risk reason:** Despite being in the same lanelet, the obstacle maintains a safe distance, slowly increasing this separation.
  - **Distance safety score:** 4
  - **Time Risk reason:** Consistent velocity with periodic positive acceleration signifies a movement away from the ego vehicle.
  - **Time safety score:** 4
  - **Overall Risk score:** 4

- **Obstacle ID: 30806**
  - **Distance Risk reason:** Moves parallel but remains outside the ego vehicle's immediate collision path, steadily increasing in distance.
  - **Distance safety score:** 5
  - **Time Risk reason:** Significant positive velocity and gradual increase in speed show a movement trajectory away from the ego.
  - **Time safety score:** 5
  - **Overall Risk score:** 5

- **Obstacle ID: 30807**
  - **Distance Risk reason:** In the same lanelet but has maintained sufficient distance from the ego vehicle; trajectory remains parallel.
  - **Distance safety score:** 4
  - **Time Risk reason:** Velocity remains constant with slight deceleration, indicating it is moving at a safe pace relative to the ego.
  - **Time safety score:** 4
  - **Overall Risk score:** 4

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:

- There are no obstacles with risk scores of 0. Several obstacles are in the same lanelet as the ego but maintain a safe distance or trajectory, reducing the collision risk effectively. 
- Obstacle 30801 is of moderate concern due to being in the same lanelet but is moving away, reducing potential collision risk.
- The scenario depicts no extreme or collision immediate risks as all obstacles show inertia or positive spatial separation in trajectory.
