Obstacle 30801 is behind the ego vehicle and very close longitudinally (-0.19m). It is moving towards the ego vehicle with a longitudinal relative velocity of 3.27 m/s.  Given its proximity and velocity, a collision is imminent.

Obstacle 30806 is also very close to the ego vehicle, both longitudinally (-3.18m) and laterally (-2.51m). Though not as critical as Obstacle 30801, its proximity and continuous approach towards the ego vehicle represent a high risk.
