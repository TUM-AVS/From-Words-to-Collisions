Obstacle 30801 is very close to the ego vehicle longitudinally (-0.19m) and is approaching from behind with a relative longitudinal velocity of 3.27 m/s. Although it's laterally aligned with the ego vehicle (lateral distance 0.00m), the closing longitudinal distance and speed pose a high risk of collision in the next few timesteps.

**Risk Levels and Definitions:**
<Collision (Score: 0)>: Actual collision has occurred or is unavoidable within the next timestep.
<Extreme Risk (Score: 1)>: Immediate collision or very high likelihood of impact. Urgent action is required.
<High Risk (Score: 2)>: Close to collision or highly probable collision path. Needs prompt attention and quick manoeuvring.
<Medium Risk (Score: 3)>: Moderate collision risk but manageable with timely reactions and proper strategies.
<Low Risk (Score: 4)>: Minimal collision risk. The situation is controllable with sufficient time to react.
<Negligible Risk (Score: 5)>: No significant collision risk. Obstacles are either moving away or far enough not to interfere.
