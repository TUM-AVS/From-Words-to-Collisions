### Safety analysis for timestep 1.3s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 30798
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is far away and moving away (22.33m longitudinally and laterally).
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason:  TTC is irrelevant as the obstacle is moving away.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 30800
- Distance Risk reason: Moderately close (8.49m longitudinally and laterally) but not immediately dangerous.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: Negative longitudinal relative velocity indicates closing, but slow (-0.32 m/s).  Lateral velocity is negligible.  TTClong is approximately 26.5s, not immediate.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3

- Obstacle ID: 30801
- Distance Risk reason: Very close behind (-2.5m longitudinally and laterally).
- Distance safety score: 1
- Time Risk reason: Closing longitudinally (1.8m/s). TTClong is approximately -1.4s (already past potential collision point if no action taken).
- Time safety score: 0
- Overall Risk score: 1

- Obstacle ID: 30802
- Distance Risk reason: Close (7.4m longitudinally and laterally), needs attention.
- Distance safety score: 2
- Time Risk reason: Negative longitudinal relative velocity indicates closing, but slow (-0.32 m/s). No lateral relative motion. TTClong approximately 23.1s
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 2

- Obstacle ID: 30804
- Distance Risk reason: Extremely close (0m longitudinally and laterally).
- Distance safety score: 0
- Time Risk reason:  Lateral motion slightly away. Longitudinal alignment implies high risk even if relative longitudinal speed is positive since distance is 0.
- Time safety score: 0
- Overall Risk score: 0

- Obstacle ID: 30805
- Distance Risk reason: Far behind (-14.17m longitudinally and laterally).
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Positive longitudinal velocity, though relatively slow (3.11 m/s) indicates closing.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- Obstacle ID: 30806
- Distance Risk reason: Reasonably far behind (-10.88m longitudinally and laterally).
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Relatively high positive longitudinal relative velocity indicates closing from behind (7.16 m/s). TTClong is approximately -1.5s (already past potential collision point if no action taken, but further away than 30801 initially).
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4


### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
    "CollisionObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "30804",

    },
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "30801",
        "OverallRiskScore": "1"
    },
    "IsCollisionScenario": true,
    "Justification": "Obstacle 30804 has an overall risk score of 0, indicating a collision. Obstacle 30801 has an overall risk score of 1, representing extreme risk.  This is due to very close proximity and closing velocities."

...(Repeat this analysis structure for each timestep - 1.4s, 1.5s, 1.6s, 1.7s, 1.8s, 1.9s, 2.0s, 2.1s, and 2.2s).  Remember to recalculate TTC and MDC for each timestep and adjust risk scores and justifications accordingly.  Note that TTC calculations become less meaningful when objects are moving away. Use relative motion descriptions and distances as your primary indicators in those cases. ...

Important Considerations for the Remaining Timesteps:

* **Obstacle 30801 & Similar:** Keep a very close eye on obstacles approaching from behind.  Even if they have passed the initial potential collision point (negative TTClong), their close proximity still presents a high risk. The scenario suggests possible lateral movement issues, so consider that as well.
* **Obstacle 30804 & Similar:**  Any obstacle at 0 distance longitudinally and laterally demands immediate attention.  Even if lateral movement is away,  it's crucial to analyze the longitudinal motion very carefully.
* **Multiple Close Obstacles:** As the scenario evolves, be mindful of situations where multiple obstacles are moderately or highly risky.  Combined risk from several obstacles might demand even more urgent action than a single critical obstacle.  The ego vehicle's maneuvering options could be constrained by the presence of multiple nearby obstacles.
* **TTC Limitations:** Be aware that TTC is a point-estimate and doesn't account for future changes in velocity or trajectory.  It's most useful as a short-term risk indicator. Always consider relative velocities and accelerations in conjunction with TTC.
* **Lateral Movement:** Pay careful attention to lateral movements, especially for obstacles to the sides (like 30804) or those approaching from behind with lateral components. Even if longitudinal TTC seems safe, lateral motion could lead to a collision.

By consistently applying these principles and recalculating the metrics, you can create a complete safety analysis for each timestep. Remember to provide the JSON summary for each timestep, noting any changes in collision or extreme risk obstacles.
