* **Obstacle 30800:** Front-right, longitudinal 12.16m, lateral -18.22m. Moving slowly towards ego longitudinally, and slightly towards laterally.  Trajectory analysis shows it has been approaching but slowly. Given the distances and slow relative velocity, TTC will be high.  This obstacle poses no immediate threat. Risk: No Risk (5)

* **Obstacle 30801:** Behind, longitudinal -0.19m, lateral 0.00m.  This obstacle is very close behind and almost perfectly aligned laterally.  The longitudinal velocity indicates it is closing rapidly (3.27 m/s). TTC = 0.19m / 3.27m/s ≈ 0.06 seconds.  MDC is practically zero. This is an **EXTREME RISK** of rear-end collision. Risk: Extreme Risk (1)

* **Obstacle 30802:** Front-right, longitudinal 9.73m, lateral -11.10m. Moving slowly towards ego longitudinally. Lateral velocity is zero. Trajectory analysis shows it has been maintaining a safe lateral distance while slowly closing longitudinally. No immediate danger. Risk: No Risk (5)

* **Obstacle 30804:** Front-right, longitudinal 3.20m, lateral -1.96m.  Moving away longitudinally, although the lateral distance is somewhat close. Trajectory analysis confirms the obstacle is moving away. Risk: Medium Risk (3) – due to proximity.

* **Obstacle 30805:** Behind, longitudinal -11.38m, lateral 0.00m.  This obstacle is behind the ego and laterally aligned. It's approaching at a moderate speed (3.29 m/s). TTC is approximately 3.46s.  MDC is > 5m.  Risk: Low Risk (4)

* **Obstacle 30806:** Rear-right, longitudinal -3.18m, lateral -2.51m.  Approaching from behind and slightly to the right.  The closing velocity is quite high longitudinally (8.49 m/s). TTC is approximately 0.38s. This is a **HIGH RISK** situation. Risk: High Risk (2)

* **Obstacle 30807:** Rear-right, longitudinal -23.88m, lateral -1.08m.  This obstacle is quite far behind and slightly to the right. It is approaching at a moderate pace but the distance provides ample time to react. Risk: No Risk (5).

**Collision Scenario Determination:**

Yes, this is a collision scenario. Obstacle 30801 poses an *Extreme Risk* (1) with a very low TTC (≈ 0.06 seconds) and near-zero distance, indicating an imminent rear-end collision.
