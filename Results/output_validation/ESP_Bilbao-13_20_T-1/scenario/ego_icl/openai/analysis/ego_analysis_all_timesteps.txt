Certainly! Let's analyze the most recent timestep (2.2 seconds) using the adjusted distances and evaluate the risk levels for each obstacle.

### Obstacle-by-Obstacle Analysis

#### 1. Obstacle 30800 (Front-right)
- **Adjusted Longitudinal Distance:** 12.16 m 
- **Adjusted Lateral Distance:** -18.22 m 
- **Relative Velocity:** Longitudinal -0.27 m/s, Lateral 0.02 m/s
- **Motion:** Approaching both longitudinally and laterally
- **Analysis:**
  - **TTC Longitudinal:** Not applicable, as relative velocity is negative (not closing, moving away)
  - **TTC Lateral:** Impossible to calculate an appropriate TTC since lateral velocity is very low and non-approaching.
  - **MDC:** Greater than 5 meters due to both components being large and diverging paths.
- **Risk Level:** 5 (No Risk)

#### 2. Obstacle 30801 (Behind)
- **Adjusted Longitudinal Distance:** -0.19 m 
- **Adjusted Lateral Distance:** 0.00 m (exact alignment)
- **Relative Velocity:** Longitudinal 3.27 m/s, Lateral 0.27 m/s
- **Motion:** Approaching longitudinally, exact lateral alignment
- **Analysis:**
  - **TTC Longitudinal:** `-0.19 / 3.27 ≈ 0` (indicates potential overlap)
  - **MDC:** 0.19 meters (less than 0.5m)
- **Risk Level:** 1 (Extreme Risk) due to negligible separation in longitudinal and exact alignment laterally.

#### 3. Obstacle 30802 (Front-right)
- **Adjusted Longitudinal Distance:** 9.73 m 
- **Adjusted Lateral Distance:** -11.10 m 
- **Relative Velocity:** Longitudinal -0.26 m/s, Lateral 0.00 m/s
- **Motion:** Approaching longitudinally
- **Analysis:**
  - **TTC Longitudinal:** Not applicable as velocity suggests it's stable or slight retreat due to small negative velocity.
  - **MDC:** Greater than 5 meters as both distances are large
- **Risk Level:** 5 (No Risk)

#### 4. Obstacle 30804 (Front-right)
- **Adjusted Longitudinal Distance:** 3.20 m 
- **Adjusted Lateral Distance:** -1.96 m 
- **Relative Velocity:** Longitudinal 9.62 m/s, Lateral -0.45 m/s
- **Motion:** Moving away longitudinally and laterally
- **Analysis:**
  - **TTC Longitudinal:** Would be quite large considering the moving away scenario
  - **MDC:** Safe based on path divergence
- **Risk Level:** 5 (No Risk)

#### 5. Obstacle 30805 (Behind)
- **Adjusted Longitudinal Distance:** -11.38 m 
- **Adjusted Lateral Distance:** 0.00 m (exact alignment)
- **Relative Velocity:** Longitudinal 3.29 m/s, Lateral 0.29 m/s
- **Motion:** Approaching longitudinally
- **Analysis:**
  - **TTC Longitudinal:** High, due to farther distance
  - **MDC:** Greater than 5 meters as lateral alignment not compensating low longitudinal proximity
- **Risk Level:** 4 (Low Risk)

#### 6. Obstacle 30806 (Rear-right)
- **Adjusted Longitudinal Distance:** -3.18 m 
- **Adjusted Lateral Distance:** -2.51 m 
- **Relative Velocity:** Longitudinal 8.49 m/s, Lateral 0.68 m/s
- **Motion:** Approaching both longitudinally and laterally
- **Analysis:**
  - **TTC Longitudinal:** `3.18 / 8.49 ≈ 0.37` seconds (Critical)
  - **TTC Lateral:** Approaching but having divergence laterally
  - **MDC:** Under 1 meter, indicating urgent risk in presence of converging paths
- **Risk Level:** 1 (Extreme Risk)

#### 7. Obstacle 30807 (Rear-right)
- **Adjusted Longitudinal Distance:** -23.88 m 
- **Adjusted Lateral Distance:** -1.08 m 
- **Relative Velocity:** Longitudinal 4.12 m/s, Lateral 0.71 m/s
- **Motion:** Approaching longitudinally, positioning confirmed laterally
- **Analysis:**
  - **TTC Longitudinal:** Far, thus not critical
  - **MDC:** Greater than 5 meters hence non-critically advised
- **Risk Level:** 5 (No Risk)

### Conclusion: Collision Scenario Identification
From the analysis, obstacles 30801 and 30806 pose significant immediate risks, especially 30801, potentially at the verge of impact due to negligible longitudinal spacing and direct path approach.
