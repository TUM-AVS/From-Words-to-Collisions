### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
                    - Obstacle ID: 30800
                    - Relative Direction: Front-right
                    - Distance Risk Reason: DTClong is 12.16m and DTClat is -18.22m. Both are relatively safe distances, but the obstacle is approaching longitudinally, therefore requiring monitoring but not immediate action.
                    - Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 5
                    - Lateral Distance Safety Score: 5
                    - Overall Distance Safety Score: 5
                    - Time Risk Reason: TTClong is 45.38s and TTClat is 855.77s.  These values indicate no immediate time-related risk. The trends over the previous timesteps suggest TTC initially decreased, indicating that obstacle 30800 was moving closer to the ego vehicle, and then began to increase suggesting a safer longitudinal interaction.
                    - Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 5
                    - Lateral Time Safety Score: 5
                    - Overall Time Safety Score: 5
                    - Overall Risk Score: 5

                    - Obstacle ID: 30801
                    - Relative Direction: Behind
                    - Distance Risk Reason: DTClong is -0.19m, indicating a very close proximity behind the ego vehicle.  This is extremely risky as it suggests an almost imminent collision.
                    - Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 1
                    - Lateral Distance Safety Score: 5
                    - Overall Distance Safety Score: 1
                    - Time Risk Reason: TTClong is 0.06s, indicating extremely high risk of a rear-end collision. TTClat is 0.00s indicating no lateral movement or data issue. The previous timesteps indicate the obstacle has been rapidly approaching.
                    - Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 1
                    - Lateral Time Safety Score: 0
                    - Overall Time Safety Score: 1
                    - Overall Risk Score: 1

                    - Obstacle ID: 30802
                    - Relative Direction: Front-right
                    - Distance Risk Reason: DTClong is 9.73m and DTClat is -11.10m, indicating safe distances.  Although this obstacle is in a similar direction to obstacle 30800, it is closer laterally.  
                    - Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 5
                    - Lateral Distance Safety Score: 5

                    - Time Risk Reason: TTClong is 37.32s, indicating no immediate risk. TTClat is inf, indicating no lateral motion relative to the ego vehicle.
                    - Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 5
                    - Lateral Time Safety Score: 5
                    - Overall Time Safety Score: 5
                    - Overall Risk Score: 5

                    - Obstacle ID: 30804
                    - Relative Direction: Front-right
                    - Distance Risk Reason: DTClong is 3.20m and DTClat is -1.96m. While DTClong appears safe, DTClat indicates lateral proximity is higher than expected, requiring some monitoring as the obstacle could pose a lateral collision risk.
                    - Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 4
                    - Lateral Distance Safety Score: 3
                    - Overall Distance Safety Score: 3.5
                    - Time Risk Reason: TTClong is inf and TTClat is inf, which indicate the obstacle is likely static relative to the ego vehicle or is moving away, suggesting no immediate time-related risk. The preceding timesteps suggest the obstacle is moving away longitudinally.
                    - Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 5
                    - Lateral Time Safety Score: 5

                    - Obstacle ID: 30806
                    - Relative Direction: Rear-right
                    - Distance Risk Reason: DTClong is -3.18m and DTClat is -2.51m.  Both are relatively close, representing an elevated risk as the obstacle is behind and to the side of the ego vehicle.
                    - Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 4
                    - Lateral Distance Safety Score: 3
                    - Overall Distance Safety Score: 3.5
                    - Time Risk Reason: TTClong is 0.37s and TTClat is 3.70s. TTClong indicates a high risk of collision from behind and must be addressed quickly.
                    - Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 1
                    - Lateral Time Safety Score: 4
                    - Overall Time Safety Score: 2.5

                    - Obstacle ID: 30807
                    - Relative Direction: Rear-right
                    - Distance Risk Reason: DTClong is -23.88m and DTClat is -1.08m. DTClong indicates that the obstacle is somewhat far behind the ego vehicle. DTClat is showing some lateral risk.  
                    - Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 5
                    - Lateral Distance Safety Score: 5
                    - Overall Distance Safety Score: 5
                    - Time Risk Reason: TTClong is 5.80s, indicating a relatively low risk currently as the obstacle is behind the ego vehicle. TTClat is 1.51s, which could be a concern in the immediate future if the obstacle is approaching.
                    - Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 5
                    - Lateral Time Safety Score: 3
