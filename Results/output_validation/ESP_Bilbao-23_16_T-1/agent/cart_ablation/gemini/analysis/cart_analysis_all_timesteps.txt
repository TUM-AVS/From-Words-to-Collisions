Analysis:

Obstacle 30921: This obstacle is in the same lane as the ego vehicle and is moving faster than the ego vehicle.  Initially, it is somewhat ahead of the ego vehicle. Over the provided timesteps, the distance between the ego vehicle and obstacle 30921 is decreasing but the rate at which the distance decrease is reducing. At 4.8 seconds, the longitudinal distance is still substantial. Therefore, while the risk is increasing, it's not yet at an extreme or collision level. I assess the risk as 3 (Medium Risk). This requires monitoring and potential action soon.

Obstacle 30922: This obstacle is in a different lane (1499) than the ego vehicle (1383). The lateral separation is significant, and there is no indication of lane change maneuvers by either vehicle. Thus, I assess the risk as 5 (Negligible Risk).
