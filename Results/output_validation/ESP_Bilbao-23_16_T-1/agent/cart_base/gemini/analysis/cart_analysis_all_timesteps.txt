Obstacle 30921: This obstacle is in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle initially, and their trajectories appear to be converging.  While the distance between them decreases over the provided timesteps, a collision doesn't appear imminent within the predicted timeframe.  The fluctuating acceleration of both vehicles adds complexity, requiring further observation. Risk score assessment: 2 (High Risk).

Obstacle 30922: This obstacle is in a different lanelet (1499) than the ego vehicle, which starts in lanelet 1362 and transitions through 1360, 536, and finally to 1383. The lateral distance between them suggests a low probability of collision, even though Obstacle 30922 shows fluctuating acceleration. Risk score assessment: 4 (Low Risk).
