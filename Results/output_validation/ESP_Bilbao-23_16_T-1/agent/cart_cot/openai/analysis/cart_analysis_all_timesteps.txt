In this scenario, we're evaluating the motion of obstacles relative to the ego vehicle, particularly focusing on the most recent timestep (4.8 seconds). Hereâ€™s an analysis of each obstacle's trajectory and potential risk based on their movements:

1. **Obstacle 30921.0:**
   - **Position:** (165.9123, -302.3935)
   - **Lanelet:** Initially shared a lane with the ego vehicle (1362), indicating a potential for close encounters.
   - **Velocity:** 7.9139 m/s, heading is rapidly changing from -2.0285 to -1.1477.
   - **Acceleration:** Continuous positive acceleration aligning with the ego's trajectory.
   - **Risk Analysis:** Given it occupies a similar path earlier, has a higher velocity, and is accelerating, the relative speed difference could cause a collision if both vehicles remain on a converging path, potentially extreme due to close proximal lane sharing.
   
2. **Obstacle 30922.0:**
   - **Position:** (170.4203, -288.0858)
   - **Lanelet:** Farther from the ego and in a different lanelet (1499), generally maintaining its lane and speed.
   - **Velocity:** Relatively high at 8.1791 m/s but heading is stable compared to the ego's varying velocity and trajectory.
   - **Risk Analysis:** While moving away from the ego, the obstacle poses a lesser risk due to stable lane usage and speed. Risk level mostly dependent on maintaining a safe lane separation.

The most significant concern is Obstacle 30921.0 due to its path convergence with the ego vehicle and considerable speed, implying high risk for an imminent collision if current trajectories persist.

### JSON Output:
```json
{
    "CollisionObstacles": [],
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "30921.0",
        "OverallRiskScore": 1
    },
    "HighRiskObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "30922.0",
        "OverallRiskScore": 2
    }
}
```

This JSON output reflects that Obstacle 30921.0 presents an extreme collision risk due to shared trajectory paths and increased proximity, while Obstacle 30922.0 presents a high risk primarily due to its speed, albeit separated by lane usage. No collisions are marked as unavoidable (Risk Score 0) at the last evaluated timestep.
