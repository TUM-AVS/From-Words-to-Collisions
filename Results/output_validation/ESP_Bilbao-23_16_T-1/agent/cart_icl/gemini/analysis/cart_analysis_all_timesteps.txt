Obstacle 30921 is in the same lane as the ego vehicle and is getting closer. At the last timestep, the distance between the vehicles decreased further, and though it's still a safe distance, the trend suggests a potential collision if the obstacle continues to decelerate while the ego vehicle maintains its current velocity.

Obstacle 30922, despite being in a different lanelet, shows concerning behavior. Its velocity is fluctuating and it experienced significant acceleration and deceleration within the provided timesteps. This erratic movement poses a potential risk if its trajectory changes towards the ego vehicle's lane.
