Upon evaluating the given scenario at 4.8 seconds, we can assess the risk levels for each obstacle relative to the ego vehicle. Let's analyze the key parameters:

1. **Ego Vehicle (30920.0):**
   - Position: (170.3069, -305.9173)
   - Velocity: 4.0589 m/s

2. **Obstacle 30921.0:**
   - Position: (165.9123, -302.3935)
   - Velocity: 7.9139 m/s
   - Shares same lanelet initially with significant lateral shift observed previously but steady alongside by 4.8s.

3. **Obstacle 30922.0:**
   - Position: (170.4203, -288.0858)
   - Velocity: 8.1791 m/s
   - Different lanelet, consistently further than 17 meters laterally from the Ego.

**Analysis:**

**Obstacle 30921.0:**
- At 4.8 seconds, 30921.0 is approximately (170.3069 - 165.9123) = 4.3946 meters lateral and (-305.9173 + 302.3935) = 3.5238 meters longitudinal away from the Ego.
- Although in the same general path, the lateral distance is considerable.
- The relative velocity along the line of approach is substantial but still not critical for immediate collision due to its slight varied lateral heading over time.

**Obstacle 30922.0:**
- At 4.8 seconds, located more than 17 meters laterally away and quickly moving further apart.
- The relative positions marked this obstacle consistently distant both longitudinally and laterally from the all sequences.

**Risk Assessment:**
- No immediate threats directly in the collision course with the Ego.
- Given the paths and exactitive lateral movements, the obstacles maintain a Low risk.
- Particularly in terms of a quick change dynamic (approach or halt towards ego vehicle), movement is spreadly kept at a distance.

The final JSON output indicates there are no Collision or Extreme Risk-level threats in this scenario given distances and velocities.
