At the most recent timestep (4.8 seconds), two obstacles, 30921 and 30922, are being tracked.

**Obstacle 30921:** This obstacle is at a lateral distance of 2.00 meters from the ego vehicle, a high-risk proximity. Although it has exact longitudinal alignment (0.00 m longitudinal distance), its consistent lateral movement towards the ego and its close proximity raise serious concerns. Considering the lateral distance, the MDC is approximately 2.00 meters, corresponding to a risk score of 2 (High Risk). This obstacle poses an immediate threat.

**Obstacle 30922:** This obstacle is laterally positioned at 16.22 meters from the ego vehicle with longitudinal alignment.  Given the significant lateral distance, the MDC is approximately 16.22 meters, and the risk score is 5 (Negligible Risk). While the lateral velocity indicates movement towards the ego vehicle, the large distance provides ample time to react, so this obstacle does not pose an immediate threat.

Because of the 2.00 meter lateral distance of Obstacle 30921 and the criteria for High Risk (0.5 < MDC ≤ 1.0 meters is 2, 1.0 < MDC ≤ 3.0 meters is 3), there are no Extreme Risk Obstacles, and only Obstacle 30921 meets the threshold for a High Risk Obstacle.
