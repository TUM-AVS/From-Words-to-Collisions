At the most recent timestep (4.8 seconds), two obstacles, 30921 and 30922, are in the Left of the ego vehicle.

Obstacle 30921 is at a lateral distance of 2.00 meters. This is quite close. Although its longitudinal velocity suggests it might not be getting closer longitudinally, the lateral distance combined with the lateral velocity (-7.28 m/s) indicates a high risk of collision if the ego vehicle were to move laterally to the left. This obstacle is assessed as High Risk (2).

Obstacle 30922 is further away laterally at 16.22 meters, posing less immediate risk than 30921.  While its lateral velocity (-7.40 m/s) indicates it is moving towards the ego vehicle, the distance provides more time to react. Considering the current distance and velocities, this obstacle is classified as a Medium Risk (3).


Risk Levels:
0: Collision - Physical contact occurred or unavoidable
1: Extreme Risk - Immediate collision likely
2: High Risk - Close to collision, needs quick action
3: Medium Risk - Manageable with proper reaction
4: Low Risk - Minimal risk, sufficient time to react
5: Negligible Risk - No significant risk
