### Safety analysis for timestep 4.8s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

**Assumptions and Clarifications:**

* Since the provided context lacks crucial information like ego vehicle's dimensions, obstacle dimensions, and adjusted distances (adjusted_d_long, adjusted_d_lat), I will make reasonable assumptions for demonstration purposes.  A real-world system would use precise measurements.
* I will assume a simplified collision box model for both ego and obstacles.
* I will assume both vehicles maintain their current velocity and acceleration (constant velocity/acceleration model) for TTC estimation. This is a simplification; more sophisticated prediction models would improve accuracy.
* "Left" and "Right" directions in provided data are reversed.

**Calculations and Estimations:**

* **Obstacle 30921:** 
    *  At t=4.8s: D_long = 0m, D_lat = 0m (Assuming these represent the adjusted distances after accounting for vehicle sizes). V_long = -0.95 m/s, V_lat = -7.28 m/s.
    * Given the 0 distance in both directions, and negative relative velocities indicates a collision is highly likely.
    * TTC_long = 0 / -0.95 = 0s
    * TTC_lat = 0 / -7.28 = 0s
    * MDC = 0m

* **Obstacle 30922:**
    * At t=4.8s: D_long = 0m, D_lat = 0m (Assuming these are adjusted distances). V_long = -7.55 m/s, V_lat = -7.40 m/s.
    *  Given 0 distance in both directions, negative relative velocities indicates a collision is imminent.
    * TTC_long = 0 / -7.55 = 0s
    * TTC_lat = 0 / -7.40 = 0s
    * MDC = 0m
