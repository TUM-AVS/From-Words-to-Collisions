### Analysis for Most Recent Timestep (4.8 seconds):

#### Obstacle 30921:
- **Position**: Left of ego car (longitudinal alignment = 0.00m, lateral = 2.00m)
- **Motion**: Exact longitudinal alignment, driving toward ego laterally from left (lateral velocity = -7.28 m/s)
- **Key Metrics**:
  - **Lateral Distance**: 2.00m (adjusted)
  - **Lateral Velocity**: -7.28 m/s (closing)
  - **TTC (Lateral)**: 2.00 / 7.28 ≈ 0.27 seconds (Extreme Risk)
  - **MDC (Lateral)**: 2.00m (High Risk)
  - **Trend**: Lateral distance decreasing rapidly (from 2.64m at 4.7s to 2.00m at 4.8s)
- **Risk Assessment**: 
  - TTC indicates Extreme Risk (0.27s < 0.5s)
  - MDC indicates High Risk (2.00m)
  - **Overall Risk**: Extreme Risk (1) - Prioritize TTC's higher risk.

#### Obstacle 30922:
- **Position**: Left of ego car (longitudinal alignment = 0.00m, lateral = 16.22m)
- **Motion**: Exact longitudinal alignment, driving toward ego laterally from left (lateral velocity = -7.40 m/s)
- **Key Metrics**:
  - **Lateral Distance**: 16.22m (adjusted)
  - **Lateral Velocity**: -7.40 m/s (closing)
  - **TTC (Lateral)**: 16.22 / 7.40 ≈ 2.19 seconds (Medium Risk)
  - **MDC (Lateral)**: 16.22m (No Risk)
  - **Trend**: Lateral distance decreasing slowly (from 16.96m at 4.7s to 16.22m at 4.8s)
- **Risk Assessment**: 
  - TTC indicates Medium Risk (2.19s)
  - MDC indicates No Risk (16.22m)
  - **Overall Risk**: Medium Risk (3) - Prioritize TTC's higher risk.

### Trajectory Analysis:
- **Obstacle 30921**: 
  - Lateral distance is decreasing rapidly (2.64m → 2.00m in 0.1s). 
  - If this trend continues, collision is imminent within the next 0.3s.
  - Longitudinal alignment is exact but stable (no closing velocity).
- **Obstacle 30922**: 
  - Lateral distance is large and closing slowly. 
  - No immediate collision risk.

### Predicted Collision:
- **Obstacle 30921** is on a collision course with the ego vehicle laterally. Given its current trajectory and velocity, it will likely collide with the ego vehicle in approximately 0.27 seconds unless evasive action is taken.
