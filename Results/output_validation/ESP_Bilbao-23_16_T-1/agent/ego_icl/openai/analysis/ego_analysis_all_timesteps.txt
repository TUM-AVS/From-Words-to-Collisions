**Analysis of the Most Recent Timestep (4.8 seconds):**

### Obstacle 30921:
- **Position:** Left of the ego vehicle.
- **Adjusted Distances:** Longitudinal is 0.00 m and lateral is 2.00 m.
- **Relative Velocities:** Longitudinal is -0.95 m/s and lateral is -7.28 m/s.
- **Trajectory:** The obstacle is exactly longitudinally aligned with the ego car, moving laterally towards the ego.

**Trajectory Analysis:**
- The obstacle has maintained a close longitudinal alignment with the ego vehicle from previous timestamps.
- Lateral distance has decreased over time, indicating a converging path.

**Risk Calculations:**
- **TTC (Lateral):** Approximately 0.27 seconds (2.00 m / 7.28 m/s).
- **MDC (Lateral):** Potential minimum lateral distance could approach zero if convergence continues.

**Risk Determination:**
- With a TTC below 0.5 seconds in the lateral direction and converging trajectory, this indicates an **Extreme Risk** situation.

### Obstacle 30922:
- **Position:** Left of the ego vehicle.
- **Adjusted Distances:** Longitudinal is 0.00 m and lateral is 16.22 m.
- **Relative Velocities:** Longitudinal is -7.55 m/s and lateral is -7.40 m/s.
- **Trajectory:** The obstacle maintains exact longitudinal alignment with a stable lateral distance, indicating a non-colliding trajectory for the short term.

**Trajectory Analysis:**
- Lateral distance has decreased, indicating the obstacle is lateral converging at a lesser rate.
- Longitudinal speed suggests a parallel trajectory with no immediate collision.

**Risk Calculations:**
- **TTC (Lateral):** Approximately 2.19 seconds (16.22 m / 7.40 m/s).
- **MDC (Lateral):** Remains significantly above 5 meters, indicating a safe margin.

**Risk Determination:**
- The lateral TTC indicates a **Medium Risk** due to the decreasing lateral distance, but with no immediate threat to collision in the short term.

Based on the detailed analysis of trajectory changes, velocities, and dimensions, the following risks apply:

```json
{
    "CollisionObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "None",
        "OverallRiskScore": "5"
    },
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "30921",
        "OverallRiskScore": "1"
    },
    "HighRiskObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "None",
        "OverallRiskScore": "5"
    }
}
```

Analysis reflects that Obstacle 30921, based on proximity and path convergence, poses an extreme short-term risk, while Obstacle 30922 remains at a lower risk level.
