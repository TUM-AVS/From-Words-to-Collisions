At t=5.0s, Ego (30920.0) is at (171.1152, -305.7903) and obstacle 30921.0 is at (166.7027, -303.7581).  Obstacle 30922.0 is at (169.7199, -289.5878).

Obstacle 30921.0 is the closest to Ego.  While the y-coordinates show some separation, the x-coordinates are converging, and previous timestamps indicate a closing distance. Given the limited information on object sizes, shapes, and lane boundaries, the sustained closing distance between Ego and Obstacle 30921.0 suggests a high risk of collision in the near future. I am rating this as a risk score of 2 (High Risk).

Obstacle 30922.0 is further away in the y-coordinate and the difference in x-coordinate has been generally increasing over the past few timesteps. While there is no immediate danger, continuous monitoring is needed. I am rating this a 4 (Low Risk).
