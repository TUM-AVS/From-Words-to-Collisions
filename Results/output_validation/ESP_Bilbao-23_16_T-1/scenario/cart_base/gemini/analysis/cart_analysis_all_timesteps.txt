At t=5.0s, Ego (30920.0) is at (171.1152, -305.7903) in lanelet 1383.0.

Obstacle 30921.0 is at (166.7027, -303.7581) in lanelet 1362.0.  While the y-coordinates are converging, the x-coordinate difference is still significant  and the trajectories suggest they are not on a direct collision course in the immediate future.  This obstacle poses a low to medium risk (3-4).

Obstacle 30922.0 is at (169.7199, -289.5878) in lanelet 1499.0. The y-coordinate difference is quite large and increasing, suggesting no immediate collision risk. This obstacle poses a negligible risk (5).

Since no obstacles present a risk score of 0 or 1,  IsCollisionScenario is false.
