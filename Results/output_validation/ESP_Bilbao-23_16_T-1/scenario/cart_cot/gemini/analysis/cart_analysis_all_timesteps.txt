### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 30921.0
- Distance Risk reason: At t=5.0s, Obstacle 30921.0 is located at (166.70, -303.76) while Ego is at (171.12, -305.79).  The lateral distance is significant, and the longitudinal distance is also increasing over the past few timesteps, indicating a diverging trajectory. Although the obstacle's lanelet (1362.0) differs from Ego's (1383.0) at the latest timestep, the past trajectories suggest they were closer previously. However, the current trend shows decreasing risk.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: The obstacle's velocity (8.15) is higher than Ego's (3.16), but the trends in acceleration over the last few timesteps for both Ego and Obstacle 30921.0 fluctuate. Given the diverging trajectories, the time-based risk appears low.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- Obstacle ID: 30922.0
- Distance Risk reason:  At t=5.0s, Obstacle 30922.0 is at (169.72, -289.59) while Ego is at (171.12, -305.79). The lateral distance is small, and the longitudinal distance is substantial. The lanelets are different (1499.0 for Obstacle 30922.0, 1383.0 for Ego) suggesting they are on different paths. Over the previous timesteps, the y-coordinate difference has remained large and relatively constant suggesting no imminent convergence in paths.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Obstacle 30922.0's velocity (8.36) is considerably higher than Ego's (3.16). However, given the consistent separation in their Y positions over time, the time to collision appears to be large, even with the velocity difference. The accelerations of both Ego and Obstacle 30922.0 show some fluctuation over the past few timesteps.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4


### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. **Most critical obstacle:**  Obstacle 30922.0 presents the most critical situation because its x-coordinate is closer to Ego's x-coordinate at the final timestep, despite being in a different lanelet. Obstacle 30921.0, although having been closer to Ego in earlier timesteps, is diverging in trajectory and therefore becomes less critical.

2. **Trajectory Analysis:**  Over the 10 timesteps, Obstacle 30921.0 initially gets closer to Ego but then diverges.  Obstacle 30922.0 remains at a relatively constant lateral (y-coordinate) distance while its x-coordinate gets closer to the Ego vehicle’s x-coordinate.

3. **Relative Positions, Velocities, and Accelerations:** At t=5.0s, the difference in the x-coordinate is the smallest for Obstacle 30922.0. The y-coordinate difference is significant for both obstacles. Velocities of both obstacles are higher than Ego’s, but the large consistent separation between Ego and Obstacle 30922.0 along the y-axis suggests a low risk of collision. Obstacle 30921.0 has increasingly larger values for both the x and y coordinate difference. 

4. **Collision Determination:**  No collision has occurred or is imminent based on the provided data.

5. **Reasoning:** Although both obstacles had higher velocities than Ego, the distances at the final timestamp, along with the trajectories observed over the previous timesteps and different lanelets suggest there is no immediate risk of a collision.

  "ScenarioAnalysis": {
    "IsCollisionScenario": false,
    "Reasoning": "No collision is detected or predicted. Although Obstacle 30922.0 gets closer in the x-coordinate, the substantial and consistent lateral separation in the y-coordinate between it and the Ego vehicle, combined with their different lanelets, indicates no immediate risk of collision. Similarly, Obstacle 30921.0 shows a diverging trajectory from the Ego vehicle."
