### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:
- **Obstacle ID: 30921.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is in a different lanelet (1362.0) than the ego vehicle (1383.0). Over the last 9 timesteps, the obstacle has been moving away from the ego vehicle in the Y-direction (from -297.4597 to -303.7581) while the ego vehicle's Y-coordinate remains around -305. The X-distance is also increasing (from 165.3821 to 166.7027 vs. ego's 171.1152).
  - **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: The obstacle's velocity (8.1474) is higher than the ego's (3.1642), and the relative velocity suggests the obstacle is moving away. The acceleration trend shows the obstacle is maintaining speed.
  - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 30922.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is in lanelet 1499.0, which is different from the ego's lanelet (1383.0). The Y-distance is decreasing (from -282.4117 to -289.5878 vs. ego's ~-305), but the X-distance is increasing (from 172.8468 to 169.7199 vs. ego's 171.1152). The obstacle is moving away diagonally.
  - **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: The obstacle's velocity (8.3635) is higher than the ego's, and the relative velocity suggests it is moving away. The acceleration trend shows minor fluctuations but no significant risk.
  - **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 30923.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is in lanelet 1499.0, different from the ego's lanelet. The Y-distance is decreasing (from -267.7859 to -274.9369 vs. ego's ~-305), but the X-distance is increasing (from 178.4299 to 175.7052 vs. ego's 171.1152). The obstacle is moving away diagonally.
  - **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: The obstacle's velocity (8.2971) is higher than the ego's, and the relative velocity suggests it is moving away. The acceleration trend shows minor fluctuations but no significant risk.
  - **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low Risk)

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. **Lanelet Analysis**: None of the obstacles share the same lanelet as the ego vehicle at the most recent timestep.
2. **Trajectory Analysis**: All obstacles are moving away from the ego vehicle in both X and Y directions over the last 9 timesteps.
3. **Velocity/Acceleration**: The ego vehicle is decelerating, while obstacles are maintaining or slightly increasing speed, further reducing collision risk.
4. **Conclusion**: No collision or extreme risk scenarios detected.
