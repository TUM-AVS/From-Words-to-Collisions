### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 30921.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is laterally separated and moving roughly parallel to the ego vehicle.  Distance has remained relatively constant over the past several timesteps.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason:  Relative velocities and accelerations suggest no immediate collision risk, but continued monitoring is needed.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- Obstacle ID: 30922.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is further away laterally and moving roughly parallel to the ego vehicle. The distance has remained relatively constant/increasing over the past several timesteps.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Relative velocities and accelerations indicate no immediate risk, with the obstacle possibly diverging.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5


### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
This is not a collision scenario.  No obstacles are on a direct collision course with the ego vehicle in the immediate future.  Both obstacles are moving roughly parallel to the ego vehicle and maintain a safe lateral distance. Although the distance has been somewhat similar in the past few seconds, the consistent behavior and lateral separation make it unlikely there is an immediate risk.
