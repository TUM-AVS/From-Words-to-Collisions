### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: 
At the latest timestep (5.0 seconds), all crucial aspects (position, orientation, velocity, acceleration) of the obstacles relative to the ego vehicle were critically analyzed:

### Obstacle Analysis:

#### Obstacle ID: 30921.0
- **Distance Risk reasoning**: The obstacle maintains a noticeable gap from the ego vehicle. Both are in distinct lanelets, indicating different trajectories.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reasoning**: Consistent velocity and lane stability over time lessen collision prospects.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 30922.0
- **Distance Risk reasoning**: Despite a higher velocity, the obstacle is positioned further from the ego vehicle. Lanelet differences suggest less direct interference.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reasoning**: The obstacle shows acceleration variability but remains on a divergent path from the ego, reflecting a diminishing collision risk.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. **Trajectory and Positions**: Obstacles sustained different lanelets than the ego throughout all timesteps.
2. **Velocity and Acceleration**: Obstacles' speeds are higher than the ego's but remain stable, with accelerations supporting divergence.
3. **MDC and TTC Calculations**: Neither obstacle approaches a critical proximity or trajectory path to trigger a collision state.

### Summary in JSON Format:
Given the evaluation, a collision scenario is improbable as the obstacles maintain sufficient distance, and their trajectories are predicted to avoid an impending collision.
