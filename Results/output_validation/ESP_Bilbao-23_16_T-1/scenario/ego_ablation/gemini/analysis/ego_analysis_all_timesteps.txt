Obstacle 30921 shows a very high risk of collision with the ego vehicle. At the last timestep (5.0 seconds), it is at a lateral distance of 1.10 meters, indicating extreme proximity. Although the longitudinal distance is 0, its high lateral velocity (-7.53 m/s) towards the ego poses a significant threat.  Obstacle 30922, though laterally further away (14.61m), is still approaching the ego laterally (-6.89 m/s).  While not posing an immediate threat, it warrants close monitoring.
