At t=5.0s, Obstacle 30921 is to the left of the ego vehicle, at a lateral distance of 1.10m.  It is moving towards the ego laterally at -7.53 m/s.  Although it is moving away longitudinally at -0.04m/s, the lateral movement and proximity present a very high risk.

Obstacle 30922 is also left of the ego, laterally at 14.61m, and approaching laterally at -6.89 m/s while moving away longitudinally at -7.90 m/s. This obstacle presents a high risk due to its lateral movement and speed, although its greater distance provides more time to react compared to Obstacle 30921.

**Risk Levels and Definitions:**
<Collision (Score: 0)>: Actual collision has occurred or is unavoidable within the next timestep.
<Extreme Risk (Score: 1)>: Immediate collision or very high likelihood of impact. Urgent action is required.
<High Risk (Score: 2)>: Close to collision or highly probable collision path. Needs prompt attention and quick manoeuvring.
<Medium Risk (Score: 3)>: Moderate collision risk but manageable with timely reactions and proper strategies.
<Low Risk (Score: 4)>: Minimal collision risk. The situation is controllable with sufficient time to react.
<Negligible Risk (Score: 5)>: No significant collision risk. Obstacles are either moving away or far enough not to interfere.

  },
  "ScenarioAnalysis": {
    "IsCollisionScenario": false,
    "Reasoning": "Obstacle 30921 poses an extreme risk due to its close proximity (1.1m lateral distance) and high lateral velocity towards the ego vehicle (-7.53 m/s). While no collision is imminent in the current timestep, a collision is highly likely in the next few timesteps without immediate corrective action. Obstacle 30922 also presents a high risk due to its lateral velocity and movement towards the ego vehicle, but it is further away laterally (14.61m) providing more time to react."
