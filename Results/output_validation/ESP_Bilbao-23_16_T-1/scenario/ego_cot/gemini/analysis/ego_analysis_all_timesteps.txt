### Safety analysis for timestep 4.1s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 30921
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is at a safe distance behind and to the left of the ego vehicle.  While moving towards the ego vehicle laterally, the longitudinal movement is away.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason:  Lateral movement poses a potential risk, but the current trajectory suggests sufficient time to react.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3

- Obstacle ID: 30922
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is at a safe distance behind and to the left of the ego vehicle. While moving towards the ego vehicle laterally, the longitudinal movement is away.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Lateral movement poses a potential risk, but the current trajectory and greater distance compared to 30921 provide more time to react.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4


### Safety analysis for timestep 4.2s - 5.0s:
*Analysis for these timesteps follow a similar pattern, with distances decreasing and risk levels increasing, especially for obstacle 30922.*


### Safety analysis for timestep 4.5s:
*Noteworthy change: Obstacle 30922 is now at the exact location of the ego vehicle (0,0).*


### Safety analysis for timestep 4.5s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 30921
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is extremely close to the ego vehicle, posing an immediate collision risk.
- Distance safety score: 1
- Time Risk reason:  Given the proximity and velocity, collision is imminent.
- Time safety score: 1
- Overall Risk score: 1

- Obstacle ID: 30922
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is in direct collision with the ego vehicle (0,0).
- Distance safety score: 0
- Time Risk reason: Collision has occurred.
- Time safety score: 0
- Overall Risk score: 0


### Safety analysis for timestep 4.6s - 5.0s:
*Both obstacles show collisions with the ego vehicle based on the (0,0) positioning.*

### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
  "CollisionObstacle": {
    "ObstacleID": "30922",
    "OverallRiskScore": "0"
  },
  "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {
    "ObstacleID": "30921",
    "OverallRiskScore": "1"
  },
  "IsCollisionScenario": true,
  "Justification": "Obstacle 30922 shows a direct collision (0,0 distance) with the ego vehicle at timestamp 4.5s and continues to overlap, indicating a collision scenario. Obstacle 30921 reaches extreme risk at 4.5s and continues to overlap afterward, further contributing to the assessment of a collision scenario."
