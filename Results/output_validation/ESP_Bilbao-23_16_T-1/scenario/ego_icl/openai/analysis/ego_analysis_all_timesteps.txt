## Analysis of the Most Recent Timestep (5.0 seconds)

### Obstacle 30921:
- **Position & Motion Overview**:
  - Position: Left of the ego vehicle
  - Distance: Longitudinal 0.00 m (exact alignment), Lateral 1.10 m
  - Relative velocity: Longitudinal -0.04 m/s, Lateral -7.53 m/s
  - Motion: Exact longitudinal alignment; moving towards the ego vehicle laterally from the left.

- **Trajectory Analysis**:
  - Previous trajectories indicate consistent lateral convergence with decreasing lateral distance - vital for side-based collisions.
  - Longitudinal alignment is exact (0.00 m), but this doesn't imply a collision alone without lateral closure.
  - Lateral velocity of -7.53 m/s indicates a fast lateral approach.

- **TTC and MDC Calculations**:
  - **Lateral TTC**: \( \text{TTC} = \frac{1.10 \, \text{m}}{7.53 \, \text{m/s}} \approx 0.146 \, \text{s} \)
  - **Lateral MDC**: 1.10 m
  
- **Risk Assessment**:
  - Lateral TTC of approximately 0.146 seconds indicates immediate convergence risk.
  - MDC greater than 0 but approaching zero indicates closing risk.
  - **Risk Score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)

### Obstacle 30922:
- **Position & Motion Overview**:
  - Position: Left of the ego vehicle
  - Distance: Longitudinal 0.00 m (exact alignment), Lateral 14.61 m
  - Relative velocity: Longitudinal -7.90 m/s, Lateral -6.89 m/s
  - Motion: Exact longitudinal alignment; moving towards the ego vehicle laterally from the left.

- **Trajectory Analysis**:
  - Although the longitudinal alignment is exact, the lateral distance is significantly large at 14.61 m, denoting non-immediate collision risk.
  - The lateral distance has been decreasing but remains safely large compared to 30921.

- **TTC and MDC Calculations**:
  - **Lateral TTC**: \( \text{TTC} = \frac{14.61 \, \text{m}}{6.89 \, \text{m/s}} \approx 2.12 \, \text{s} \)
  - **Lateral MDC**: 14.61 m
  
- **Risk Assessment**:
  - Lateral TTC of approximately 2.12 seconds suggests potential concern but not immediate collision risk.
  - MDC over 3.0 meters argues against low risk but indicates the need for monitoring.
  - **Risk Score**: 3 (Medium Risk)

## Conclusion:
- **Collision Determination**:
  - Obstacle 30921 presents an extreme risk scenario due to an imminent lateral approach, very low TTC, and MDC approaching zero.
  - Obstacle 30922 poses no immediate threat but is trending towards eventual convergence, if trajectories remain unchecked.

- **Collision Scenario**: Yes, due to the extreme risk from Obstacle 30921.
