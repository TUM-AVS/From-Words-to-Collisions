### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
    - Obstacle ID: 30921
    - Relative Direction: Left
    - Distance Risk Reason: Obstacle 30921 is to the left of the ego vehicle and has been consistently approaching laterally over the past several timesteps. Lateral distance is now very close at 1.10m, posing an extreme risk.  Longitudinal distance is essentially 0 as it is aligned with the ego vehicle longitudinally.
    - Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 0
    - Lateral Distance Safety Score: 1
    - Overall Distance Safety Score: 1.0
    - Time Risk Reason:  The lateral TTC is extremely low at 0.15s indicating imminent lateral collision. Longitudinal TTC is not relevant as it has reached zero.  The decreasing trend of Lateral TTC over the timesteps confirms the immediate danger.
    - Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 0
    - Lateral Time Safety Score: 1
    - Overall Time Safety Score: 1.0
    - Overall Risk Score: 1

    - Obstacle ID: 30922
    - Relative Direction: Left
    - Distance Risk Reason:  Obstacle 30922 is also to the left and has been approaching laterally, but it is significantly further away laterally at 14.61m compared to Obstacle 30921. It poses no immediate distance risk. Longitudinally, it is aligned with the ego vehicle.
    - Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 0
    - Lateral Distance Safety Score: 5
    - Overall Distance Safety Score: 5.0
    - Time Risk Reason:  The Lateral TTC is 2.12s suggesting no immediate time-based risk. Longitudinal TTC is irrelevant due to longitudinal alignment. The trend of TTClat shows slightly decreasing values, but still far from dangerous.
    - Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 0
    - Lateral Time Safety Score: 3
    - Overall Time Safety Score: 3.0
    - Overall Risk Score: 4
