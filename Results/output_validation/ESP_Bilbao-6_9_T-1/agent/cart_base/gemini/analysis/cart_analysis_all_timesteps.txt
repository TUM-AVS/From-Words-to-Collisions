Obstacle 30689: This obstacle starts in a different lanelet (1093) than the ego vehicle (134).  It then transitions to lanelet 140. While its trajectory doesn't appear to directly intersect the ego vehicle's path based on the provided position data, its relatively high velocity and changing acceleration could pose a risk if it were to make a sudden maneuver. Given the available data, the risk level is assessed as 4 (Low Risk).

Obstacle 30693: This obstacle is stationary (velocity and acceleration are 0) in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle. Its position remains constant throughout the provided timeframe. The distance between the ego and this obstacle is relatively small. While the ego's velocity is decreasing, there is still a potential for collision if the ego does not decelerate sufficiently. Given the small distance, lack of movement from the obstacle, and egoâ€™s decreasing velocity, the risk is considered high. Risk level is 2 (High Risk).
