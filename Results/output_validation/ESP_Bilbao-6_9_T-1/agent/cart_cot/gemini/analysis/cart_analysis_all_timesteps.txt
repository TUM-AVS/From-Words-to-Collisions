Obstacle 30693 is stationary and in the same lane as the ego vehicle, but it maintains a safe distance and poses no immediate threat. Although the ego vehicle is decelerating, the rate is not drastic enough to cause concern in the near future.

Obstacle 30689, while in a different lanelet initially, transitions to lanelet 140.  Although it's not in the ego vehicle's lane, its trajectory and relatively high speed compared to the decelerating ego vehicle warrant attention.  At the last timestep, this obstacle's x-coordinate is decreasing, indicating a potential path that could intersect with the ego vehicle's path if the trend continues. Further monitoring of Obstacle 30689 is needed, therefore assigning it a medium risk.
