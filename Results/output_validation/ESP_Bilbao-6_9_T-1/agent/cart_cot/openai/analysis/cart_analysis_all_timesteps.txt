Based on the scenario provided, let's analyze the interaction between the Ego vehicle and each of the obstacles across the given timesteps, focusing primarily on the most recent one.

**Time step at 13.3 seconds:**

- **Ego Vehicle (30685.0):** 
  - Position: (108.4918, 504.8301) 
  - Velocity: 2.6206
  - Located in lanelet 134.0

- **Obstacle 30689.0:**
  - Position: (119.6601, 524.6861)
  - Velocity: 8.6645
  - Located in lanelet 140.0

- **Obstacle 30693.0:**
  - Position: (112.904, 507.2809)
  - Velocity: 0.0
  - Located in lanelet 134.0

**Analysis:**

1. **Obstacle 30689.0:** 
   - It is moving at a faster speed compared to the Ego vehicle, and their positions are not converging significantly, given they're in separate lanelets (1093.0 previously, now 140.0, indicating a different path from Ego's lanelet 134.0). 
   - Risk Level: Evaluating its path and speed, it remains relatively distant without any imminent convergence indicating a low risk. 
   - **Overall Risk Score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)

2. **Obstacle 30693.0:** 
   - It is stationary within the same lanelet as the Ego vehicle. The increasing proximity over timesteps indicates a reducing distance. Still, the Ego vehicle is gradually decelerating, maintaining this gap without an immediate collision risk.
   - Since it's located in the same lanelet and stationary, this is the most critical analyzed obstacle. There is no evident acceleration to infer a plan from the obstacle vehicle, so the risk involves careful monitoring and potentially evasive actions by the Ego.
   - **Overall Risk Score:** 2 (High Risk)
   - While the risk is not extreme, continual monitoring is essential given they share the same lanelet and there is a potential for collision if the Ego's deceleration strategy fails or if the obstacle vehicle starts to move unexpectedly.

**Brief Analysis for Obstacle with Highest Risk (30693.0):**  
Obstacle 30693.0 is stationary in the same lanelet as the Ego vehicle. Although the Ego is decelerating, continued presence within the same lanelet at a narrowing distance raises the risk. Tactical adjustments or changes in lane or deceleration strategy might be required to avert potential collision in future time steps.
