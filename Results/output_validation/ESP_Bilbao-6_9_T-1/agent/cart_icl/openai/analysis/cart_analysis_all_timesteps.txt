To evaluate the collision risk scenario at 13.3 seconds, we will first analyze the relative positions and velocities of the obstacles with respect to the ego vehicle (30685.0).

### At 13.3 seconds:
1. **Ego Vehicle (30685.0):**
   - Position: (108.4918, 504.8301)
   - Velocity: 2.6206 m/s
   - Acceleration: -0.7705 m/sÂ²

2. **Obstacle 30689.0:**
   - Position: (119.6601, 524.6861)
   - Velocity: 8.6645 m/s
   - Lanelet: 140.0
   - Relative longitudinal position: ~14.5 meters ahead
   - Relative velocity: Some lateral separation, and the velocity does not pose immediate risk for a frontal collision. This obstacle has deviated to lanelet 140.0, indicating it is not in the same path and poses **low risk (4)**.

3. **Obstacle 30693.0:**
   - Position: (112.904, 507.2809)
   - Velocity: 0.0 m/s (Stationary)
   - Lanelet: 134.0 (Same as Ego)
   - Relative position: ~4.5 meters apart laterally.
   - Since the obstacle isn't moving, the risk remains **low to medium (3-4)** given the close proximity but considering the current lateral distance and lateral motion trends, it remains non-immediate threat.

### Risk Assessment:
- Neither of the obstacles has been identified with a TTC that is critically low nor a direct collision path with the ego vehicle.
- There are no indicators suggesting entities with risk levels of 0 or 1.

The final JSON response reflects the observations:

```json
{
    "CollisionObstacles": [],
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null,
    "HighRiskObstacle": null
}
```

This JSON indicates that there are no obstacles with direct and immediate collision risks. The distances and lanes suggest manageable risks without imminent collision threats.
