Obstacle 30689 is moving away laterally from the ego vehicle and longitudinally towards the ego vehicle. At the last timestep (13.3 seconds), this obstacle is at a longitudinal distance of 14.88 meters and a lateral distance of 10.35 meters. Given the current relative velocity and acceleration, this obstacle poses a low risk.

Obstacle 30693 is directly in front of the ego vehicle and approaching longitudinally. In the last timestep, this obstacle is only 0.54 meters away longitudinally.  Given the very close proximity and the closing velocity, this obstacle represents an extreme risk of collision.

Risk Levels:
0: Collision - Physical contact occurred or unavoidable
1: Extreme Risk - Immediate collision likely
2: High Risk - Close to collision, needs quick action
3: Medium Risk - Manageable with proper reaction
4: Low Risk - Minimal risk, sufficient time to react
5: Negligible Risk - No significant risk
