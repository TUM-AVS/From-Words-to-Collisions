### Safety analysis for timestep 13.3s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

First, we need to acknowledge that we are missing a crucial piece of information: the adjusted distances (adjusted_d_long and adjusted_d_lat).  Since these are explicitly stated as necessary for proper evaluation, I will have to make assumptions about these values based on the raw distances provided. This will impact the accuracy of the risk assessment.  I will assume the vehicle sizes are such that adjusted longitudinal distance is approximately 20% less than raw longitudinal distance, and the adjusted lateral distance is approximately 10% less than the raw lateral distance. This is a rough estimate and should be replaced with actual vehicle dimensions in a real-world scenario.

**Assumptions for Adjusted Distances:**

- **Obstacle 30689:** adjusted_d_long = 11.9m, adjusted_d_lat = 13.4m
- **Obstacle 30693:** adjusted_d_long = 0.43m, adjusted_d_lat = 0.49m

### Obstacle Analysis:

**- Obstacle ID: 30689**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is in the Front-left with adjusted_d_long = 11.9m and adjusted_d_lat = 13.4m.  This is a safe distance.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Although the obstacle is moving towards the ego vehicle longitudinally, the lateral movement is away from the ego vehicle, and given the distances and relative velocities, TTC is likely >5 seconds. A precise TTC calculation requires more information but seems safe given the current data.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

**- Obstacle ID: 30693**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is directly in Front with adjusted_d_long = 0.43m and adjusted_d_lat = 0.49m.  This is extremely close.
- Distance safety score: 1
- Time Risk reason: The obstacle is very close and moving towards the ego vehicle longitudinally with a non-negligible relative velocity, suggesting a very short TTC, likely less than 0.5 seconds.  
- Time safety score: 1
- Overall Risk score: 1

**Important Notes:**

* The lack of precise adjusted distances significantly hampers this analysis.  The assumptions made are likely not entirely accurate. Providing the actual adjusted distances is crucial for a reliable safety assessment.
* This analysis assumes a constant relative velocity and acceleration. In reality, these values might change, requiring continuous re-evaluation.  
* The relative lateral distance, speed and acceleration of 30693 is 0, but it is described as "in the Front",  which does not make sense. It seems unlikely that the obstacle will be perfectly laterally aligned, so there may be errors in the provided data or additional information is needed.  A lateral offset is likely to increase risk due to closer proximity. 
* A more rigorous approach would involve calculating the precise TTC based on the kinematics and using the minimum predicted distance over the time horizon for the MDC. This would give a more dynamic and accurate representation of the risk.
