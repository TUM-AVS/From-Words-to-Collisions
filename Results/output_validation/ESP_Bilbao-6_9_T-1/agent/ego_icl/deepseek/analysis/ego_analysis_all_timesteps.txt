### Obstacle-by-Obstacle Analysis

#### Obstacle 30689 (Front-left of ego car)
- **Most Recent Timestep (13.3s):**
  - Adjusted longitudinal distance: 14.88 m
  - Adjusted lateral distance: 10.35 m
  - Relative velocity: longitudinal -4.43 m/s (approaching), lateral 8.47 m/s (moving away)
  - Motion: Driving toward ego longitudinally, moving away laterally to the left.

**Trajectory Analysis:**
- Longitudinal distance is decreasing (from 19.52m to 14.88m over 0.9s), indicating closing velocity.
- Lateral distance is increasing (from 2.62m to 10.35m over 0.9s), indicating diverging paths.

**TTC Calculation:**
- Longitudinal TTC = 14.88 / 4.43 ≈ 3.36 seconds (Medium Risk, but lateral distance is increasing).
- Lateral TTC is not applicable (moving away).

**MDC Calculation:**
- The obstacle is moving away laterally, so the MDC is effectively the current lateral distance (10.35m), which is No Risk (5).

**Overall Risk:**
- The obstacle is moving away laterally, and while it is approaching longitudinally, the lateral divergence ensures no collision risk. 
- **Overall Risk Score: 5 (Negligible Risk)**

#### Obstacle 30693 (Front of ego car)
- **Most Recent Timestep (13.3s):**
  - Adjusted longitudinal distance: 0.54 m
  - Adjusted lateral distance: 0.00 m (exact alignment)
  - Relative velocity: longitudinal -2.62 m/s (approaching), lateral 0.00 m/s (no lateral movement)
  - Motion: Driving toward ego longitudinally, exact lateral alignment.

**Trajectory Analysis:**
- Longitudinal distance is decreasing rapidly (from 3.52m to 0.54m over 0.9s).
- Lateral distance remains 0.00m (same lane alignment).

**TTC Calculation:**
- Longitudinal TTC = 0.54 / 2.62 ≈ 0.206 seconds (Extreme Risk, TTC < 0.5s).
- Lateral TTC is not applicable (no lateral movement).

**MDC Calculation:**
- Since the obstacle is longitudinally aligned (lateral distance = 0.00m), the MDC is the longitudinal distance (0.54m), which falls in the High Risk range (0.5 < MDC ≤ 1.0m).

**Overall Risk:**
- The TTC indicates Extreme Risk (1), while MDC indicates High Risk (2). We prioritize the higher risk (lower score).
- **Overall Risk Score: 1 (Extreme Risk)**  
  This obstacle is on a collision course with the ego vehicle within 0.206 seconds if no evasive action is taken.

### Key Findings:
- **Obstacle 30693** is at **Extreme Risk (1)** due to very low TTC (0.206s) and small longitudinal distance (0.54m) with closing velocity. Immediate evasive action is required to avoid collision.
- **Obstacle 30689** poses **Negligible Risk (5)** as it is moving away laterally despite approaching longitudinally.
- No collision is currently occurring, but Obstacle 30693 is imminent if trajectories remain unchanged.
