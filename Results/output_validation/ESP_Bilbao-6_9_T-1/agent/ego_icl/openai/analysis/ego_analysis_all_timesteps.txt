### Obstacle-by-Obstacle Analysis

#### Obstacle 30689
- **Position and Motion**:
  - Positioned Front-left of the ego car.
  - Adjusted distances: longitudinal 14.88 m, lateral 10.35 m.
  - Motion indicates the obstacle is moving away laterally while closing longitudinally.
  
- **Trajectory Analysis**:
  - Over the timesteps, this obstacle is continuously reducing its longitudinal distance while lateral distance increases, suggesting a divergence laterally but still approaching longitudinally.

- **Time-to-Collision (TTC) Calculation**:
  - Longitudinal velocity = -4.43 m/s (approaching due to negative sign)
  - TTC (longitudinal) = 14.88 m / 4.43 m/s = 3.36 seconds

- **Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC) Calculation**:
  - MDC can be assumed based on the trajectory as more influenced by lateral divergence.
  - With the lateral distance increasing significantly and both distances not nearing 0, MDC is greater than 3 m.

- **Risk Assessment**:
  - Longitudinal distance is significantly above any critical threshold and lateral divergence indicates manageable risks.
  - **Risk Level**: 3 - Medium Risk

#### Obstacle 30693
- **Position and Motion**:
  - Positioned directly in front of the ego car.
  - Adjusted distances: longitudinal 0.54 m, lateral 0.00 m.
  - Exact longitudinal alignment with a closing approach.

- **Trajectory Analysis**:
  - The obstacle continuously closes in on the ego vehicle with a considerable reduction in distance across timesteps, remaining on the same lateral plane.

- **Time-to-Collision (TTC) Calculation**:
  - Longitudinal velocity = -2.62 m/s (approaching)
  - TTC (longitudinal) = 0.54 m / 2.62 m/s = 0.21 seconds

- **Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC) Calculation**:
  - As both longitudinal and lateral distances indicate very close proximity with converging trajectories.
  - MDC is 0.54 meters longitudinally as lateral constraint is 0.

- **Risk Assessment**:
  - Extremely close in front, aligned in the same lane with a rapid decrease in clearance, leading to an inevitable collision if no action is taken.
  - **Risk Level**: 1 - Extreme Risk

#### Final Thoughts:
- **Obstacle 30693** is of the utmost concern, given its extreme proximity and alignment directly in front of the ego vehicle. Immediate evasive action or braking is advised to mitigate collision risk.
- **Obstacle 30689** presents a medium risk, largely manageable due to increasing lateral separation. However, caution should be exercised given the consistent approach longitudinally.
