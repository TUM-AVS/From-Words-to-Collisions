At t=13.5s, Ego is at (108.949, 505.0833) in lanelet 134.0. Obstacle 30689.0 is at (118.5222, 525.9939) in lanelet 140.0, and Obstacle 30693.0 is stationary at (112.904, 507.2809) in lanelet 134.0.

Obstacle 30689.0, while on a different lanelet (140.0) than Ego (134.0), does not pose an immediate collision risk given its current trajectory.  The trajectory history indicates it is moving away from the Ego vehicle. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for a risk score of 0 or 1.

Obstacle 30693.0 is stationary in the same lanelet as Ego.  The distance between Ego and Obstacle 30693.0 is approximately 2.2 meters and Ego's velocity is decreasing. While Ego is approaching Obstacle 30693.0, it is unlikely a collision will occur within the next second or two without intervention.  The risk level for Obstacle 30693.0 is assessed as 2 (High Risk) requiring attention and possible action to avoid future collision.

Because there are no obstacles posing a risk score of 0 or 1, IsCollisionScenario is false.
