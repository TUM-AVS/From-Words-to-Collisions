Obstacle 30689 is moving away from the ego vehicle and poses no risk. Obstacle 30693 is stationary in the same lane as the ego vehicle, and the distance between them is small and closing as the ego vehicle decelerates. At the last timestep, the ego is at (108.949, 505.0833) and obstacle 30693 is at (112.904, 507.2809).  The distance is approximately 4 meters. Given the ego's deceleration, a collision is highly probable in the next timestep.
