### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 30689.0
- Distance Risk reason: This obstacle is in a different lanelet (140.0) than the ego vehicle (134.0) at the most recent timestep.  While its Y-coordinate is getting closer to the ego vehicle's, its X-coordinate suggests lateral separation and it poses no immediate risk. The historical data shows it moving in a different general direction than the ego vehicle.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason:  Given the different lanelets and trajectories observed over the past 10 timesteps, a collision in the near future is unlikely. The obstacle's velocity and acceleration are not relevant for a collision assessment as it moves away laterally.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 30693.0
- Distance Risk reason: This obstacle is in the same lanelet (134.0) as the ego vehicle and its position has remained static over the entire time period. It is situated ahead of the ego vehicle. The distance between them is moderately small.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: This obstacle is stationary (velocity and acceleration are zero). The ego vehicle is approaching it, as shown by the decreasing distance between them in the provided data. This represents a potential collision risk if the ego vehicle does not brake or change lanes.
- Time safety score: 2
- Overall Risk score: 2

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. **Most critical obstacle:** Obstacle 30693.0 poses the most significant risk as it is stationary in the same lane and the ego vehicle is approaching it. While obstacle 30689.0 got slightly closer in terms of Y-coordinate, the overall trajectories and different lanelets mitigate the risk.

2. **Trajectories:** Over the 10 timesteps, obstacle 30693.0 remained static. The ego vehicle consistently moves closer to it within the same lanelet. Obstacle 30689.0 consistently moves in a different lanelet, away from the ego vehicle's path.

3. **Relative Positions, Velocities, and Accelerations:**  The decreasing distance between the ego vehicle and obstacle 30693.0, coupled with the obstacle's stationary nature and the ego vehicle's forward velocity, makes a collision increasingly likely unless the ego vehicle takes evasive action. Obstacle 30689.0's velocity and acceleration are irrelevant to collision risk due to lateral movement away from the ego vehicle's lane.

4. **Collision Imminent:** No collision has occurred yet. However, a collision with obstacle 30693.0 is likely in the near future if the ego vehicle does not decelerate or change lanes.

5. **Reasoning:** The consistent approach of the ego vehicle towards a stationary object in the same lane, combined with the limited timeframe, leads to the conclusion that this is a potentially dangerous situation requiring intervention.
