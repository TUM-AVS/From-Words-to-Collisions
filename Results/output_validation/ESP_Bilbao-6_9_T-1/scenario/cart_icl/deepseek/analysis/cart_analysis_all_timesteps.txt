### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. No obstacles are on a direct collision course with the ego vehicle.
2. All obstacles are either stationary, moving away, or maintaining a safe distance.
3. The ego vehicle is decelerating, reducing any residual risk.
4. No extreme risk (score 1) or collision (score 0) scenarios detected.
