### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 30689.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is in a different lanelet and moving away from the ego vehicle.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason:  The obstacle's trajectory poses no immediate threat.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 30693.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle, but maintaining a safe distance.  While the Y coordinates are similar, the X coordinates are separated, and the obstacle is stationary.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Obstacle is stationary, posing no immediate time-based risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 4


### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. **Identify potential collisions:**  Focus on the latest timestep (13.5 seconds).
2. **Obstacle 30689.0:** In a different lanelet and moving away. No collision risk.
3. **Obstacle 30693.0:** Stationary and in the same lanelet, but far enough ahead to be safe. Low risk given the current information but requires monitoring.
4. **Conclusion:** No immediate collision.
