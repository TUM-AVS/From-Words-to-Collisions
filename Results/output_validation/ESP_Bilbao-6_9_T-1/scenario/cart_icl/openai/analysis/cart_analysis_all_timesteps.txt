### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: 
Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

#### Obstacle 1:
- **Obstacle ID**: 30689.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: This obstacle is in a different lanelet (140.0) compared to the ego vehicle (134.0), moving away from the ego with consistent velocity and trajectory. There is no immediate risk of lane cross over.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: Given the steady trajectory away from the ego vehicle, and sustained high velocity without significant deceleration, this obstacle displays negligible collision risk.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

#### Obstacle 2:
- **Obstacle ID**: 30693.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: Positioned in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle (134.0) and stationary, it poses a high risk of potential collision if no maneuver is made.
- **Distance safety score**: 1
- **Time Risk reason**: This obstacle shows no velocity or acceleration changes, maintaining its position throughout all timesteps, indicating an immediate threat if the ego does not alter its path.
- **Time safety score**: 1
- **Overall Risk score**: 1

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. **Obstacle 30689.0** is clearly in a separate trajectory relative to the ego vehicle which minimizes any collision risk. Given its direction and speed, it is moving away safely.
2. **Obstacle 30693.0** is in the same lane and stationary, creating a significant collision risk. Without evasive action from the ego vehicle, the trajectory will lead directly to impact.
3. Considering the historical data, the risk level for Obstacle 30693.0 remains constant as the ego vehicle was consistently reducing its speed, likely attempting to avoid a collision, but its current velocity still presents a threat.
