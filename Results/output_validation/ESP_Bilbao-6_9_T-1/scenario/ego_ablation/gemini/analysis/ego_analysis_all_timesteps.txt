Obstacle 30689 shows no immediate risk of collision. It maintains a safe lateral distance and although moving longitudinally towards the ego vehicle, the distance and relative velocity suggest ample time for reaction.

Obstacle 30693, however, presents a critical risk.  At the last timestep (13.5 seconds), the longitudinal distance is a mere 0.02 meters, practically touching. With a closing relative velocity and the obstacle directly in front, a collision is imminent if immediate action isn't taken.
