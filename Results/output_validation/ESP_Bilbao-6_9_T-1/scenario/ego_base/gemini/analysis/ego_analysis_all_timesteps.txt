Obstacle 30693 is at high risk of collision. It is almost directly in front of the ego vehicle (0.02m longitudinal distance) and closing at -2.31 m/s. Although the relative acceleration suggests the ego vehicle is braking (0.76 m/sÂ²), the small distance makes a collision practically unavoidable in the next timestep.

Obstacle 30689 is at medium risk. While it is moving towards the ego longitudinally, it's also moving laterally away to the left and is at a safe distance (14.00m longitudinal and 12.04m lateral).

**Risk Levels and Definitions:**
<Collision (Score: 0)>: Actual collision has occurred or is unavoidable within the next timestep.
<Extreme Risk (Score: 1)>: Immediate collision or very high likelihood of impact. Urgent action is required.
<High Risk (Score: 2)>: Close to collision or highly probable collision path. Needs prompt attention and quick manoeuvring.
<Medium Risk (Score: 3)>: Moderate collision risk but manageable with timely reactions and proper strategies.
<Low Risk (Score: 4)>: Minimal collision risk. The situation is controllable with sufficient time to react.
<Negligible Risk (Score: 5)>: No significant collision risk. Obstacles are either moving away or far enough not to interfere.
