### Safety analysis for timestep 12.6s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 30689
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is located 18.38m longitudinally and laterally away from the ego vehicle in the front-left direction.  This represents a safe distance.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: The negative longitudinal relative velocity (-5.40 m/s) suggests the obstacle is approaching the ego vehicle, but the lateral movement is away from the ego vehicle (8.45 m/s). Given the current distances and velocities, collision is unlikely.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- Obstacle ID: 30693
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is very close to the ego vehicle, at 2.75m longitudinally and laterally in front.  This represents a high risk of collision.
- Distance safety score: 2
- Time Risk reason: The negative longitudinal relative velocity (-3.60 m/s) and close proximity indicate a high risk of imminent collision.
- Time safety score: 1
- Overall Risk score: 1


### Safety analysis for timestep 12.7s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 30689
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is located 17.83m longitudinally and laterally away from the ego vehicle in the front-left direction. This represents a safe distance.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: The negative longitudinal relative velocity (-5.19 m/s) suggests the obstacle is approaching the ego vehicle, but the lateral movement is away from the ego vehicle (8.44 m/s). Given the current distances and velocities, collision is unlikely.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- Obstacle ID: 30693
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is extremely close to the ego vehicle, at 2.38m longitudinally and laterally in front. This represents a very high risk of collision.
- Distance safety score: 1
- Time Risk reason: The negative longitudinal relative velocity (-3.39 m/s) and extremely close proximity indicate a very high risk of imminent collision.
- Time safety score: 1
- Overall Risk score: 1


### Safety analysis for timestep 12.8s - 13.4s:  (Analysis pattern continues similarly to previous timestamps, with Obstacle 30689 maintaining a low risk and Obstacle 30693 showing increasing risk approaching collision)

### Safety analysis for timestep 13.5s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 30689
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is located 14.00m longitudinally and laterally away from the ego vehicle in the front-left direction. This represents a safe distance.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: While the obstacle has a negative longitudinal relative velocity, the lateral movement and distance suggest no immediate risk.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- Obstacle ID: 30693
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is virtually touching the ego vehicle (0.02m longitudinally and laterally).  Collision is imminent.
- Distance safety score: 0
- Time Risk reason: The negative longitudinal relative velocity and zero distance indicate a collision.
- Time safety score: 0
- Overall Risk score: 0



### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
  "CollisionObstacle": {
    "ObstacleID": "30693",
    "OverallRiskScore": "0"
  },
  "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null,
  "IsCollisionScenario": true,
  "Justification": "Obstacle 30693 shows a continuous decrease in distance to the ego vehicle, culminating in a collision at timestep 13.5s.  The consistently negative longitudinal relative velocity, coupled with the near-zero distance at the final timestep, confirms the collision."
