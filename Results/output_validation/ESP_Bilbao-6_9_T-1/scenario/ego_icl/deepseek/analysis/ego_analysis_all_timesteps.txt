### Obstacle-by-Obstacle Analysis

#### Obstacle 30689 (Front-left)
- **Most Recent Timestep (13.5s)**:
  - Adjusted Distance: Longitudinal 14.00 m, Lateral 12.04 m
  - Relative Velocity: Longitudinal -4.12 m/s, Lateral 8.49 m/s
  - Motion: Driving toward ego longitudinally, moving away laterally to the left.
- **Trajectory Analysis**:
  - Longitudinal distance is decreasing (from 18.38m to 14.00m over 0.9s).
  - Lateral distance is increasing (from 4.36m to 12.04m over 0.9s).
  - The obstacle is moving diagonally away from the ego vehicle (left and forward).
- **TTC Calculation**:
  - Longitudinal TTC: 14.00 / 4.12 ≈ 3.40s (Low Risk, 4)
  - Lateral TTC: Not applicable (moving away).
- **MDC Calculation**:
  - The obstacle is moving away laterally, so MDC is effectively infinite (No Risk, 5).
- **Overall Risk**: No Risk (5).

#### Obstacle 30693 (Front)
- **Most Recent Timestep (13.5s)**:
  - Adjusted Distance: Longitudinal 0.02 m, Lateral 0.00 m
  - Relative Velocity: Longitudinal -2.31 m/s, Lateral 0.00 m/s
  - Motion: Driving toward ego longitudinally, exact lateral alignment.
- **Trajectory Analysis**:
  - Longitudinal distance is decreasing rapidly (from 2.75m to 0.02m over 0.9s).
  - Lateral distance remains 0.00m (exact alignment).
  - The obstacle is directly in front of the ego vehicle and closing fast.
- **TTC Calculation**:
  - Longitudinal TTC: 0.02 / 2.31 ≈ 0.0087s (Extreme Risk, 1).
  - Lateral TTC: Not applicable (no lateral movement).
- **MDC Calculation**:
  - Current longitudinal distance is 0.02m (Collision Risk, 0).
- **Overall Risk**: Collision Risk (0).

### Collision Scenario Determination
- Obstacle 30693 is at a longitudinal distance of 0.02m with a closing velocity of 2.31 m/s. This is effectively a collision (distance ≈ 0m with closing velocity).
- Obstacle 30689 poses no risk as it is moving away from the ego vehicle.
