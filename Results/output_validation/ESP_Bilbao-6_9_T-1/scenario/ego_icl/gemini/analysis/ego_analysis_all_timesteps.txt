**Obstacle-by-Obstacle Analysis at t=13.5s:**

**Obstacle 30689:**

* **Trajectory Analysis:**  Over the past 0.9 seconds, this obstacle has been consistently moving closer to the ego vehicle longitudinally while moving further away laterally.  The longitudinal velocity is negative (towards ego) and decreasing in magnitude (slowing down its approach), while the lateral velocity is positive (away from ego) and slightly increasing.

* **Calculations and Reasoning:** At t=13.5s, the longitudinal distance is 14.00m and closing, while the lateral distance is 12.04m and increasing. Given the large lateral distance and the diverging lateral trajectory, a lateral collision is highly unlikely.  Even though the longitudinal distance is decreasing, the large initial separation and the relatively slow closing speed suggest low longitudinal risk. We can't accurately calculate TTC for the lateral component since relative_velocity is positive (moving apart) but let's estimate a longitudinal TTC for reference.

    * Longitudinal TTC = 14.00m / 4.12 m/s ≈ 3.40s

* **Risk Assessment:**
    * Longitudinal Risk: Medium (3) based on TTC.
    * Lateral Risk: No Risk (5) based on large separation and diverging path.
    * Overall Risk: Medium (3) - Dominated by the longitudinal approach, but the lateral divergence mitigates the overall risk.

**Obstacle 30693:**

* **Trajectory Analysis:** This obstacle has maintained a consistent longitudinal alignment with the ego vehicle (lateral distance = 0.00m throughout the entire period), indicating it is likely in the same lane. The longitudinal distance has been rapidly decreasing across all timesteps, suggesting an imminent collision.

* **Calculations and Reasoning:** At t=13.5s, the longitudinal distance is a mere 0.02m with a closing relative velocity. This extremely small distance combined with the continuous approach makes a collision practically unavoidable without immediate intervention.  The lateral alignment further confirms that this is a head-on collision scenario in the same lane.

    * Longitudinal TTC = 0.02m / 2.31 m/s ≈ 0.01s 

* **Risk Assessment:**
    * Longitudinal Risk: Collision Imminent (1) - extremely low TTC and distance.
    * Lateral Risk:  Not applicable, as the lateral alignment here means the obstacle and ego vehicle are in the same lane, not on a collision course from the side. Lateral analysis in this case serves to highlight the direct impact of the longitudinal closure.
    * Overall Risk: Extreme Risk (1) due to near-zero distance and impending collision.

**Collision Scenario Determination:**

Yes, this is a collision scenario. Obstacle 30693 poses an Extreme Risk (1) with a near-zero distance (0.02m) and a very low TTC (0.01s), indicating an imminent collision.
