### Obstacle Analysis and Trajectory Evaluation

#### Obstacle 30689: Front-left
- **Most Recent Timestep Analysis (13.5 seconds):**
  - **Adjusted Distances:**
    - Longitudinal: 14.00 m
    - Lateral: 12.04 m
  - **Relative Velocity:**
    - Longitudinal: -4.12 m/s (approaching)
    - Lateral: 8.49 m/s (moving away)
  - **Relative Acceleration:**
    - Longitudinal: 0.54 m/s²
    - Lateral: 0.67 m/s²

- **Trajectory and Risk Assessment:**
  - Over the recorded interval, the obstacle consistently decreased in longitudinal distance while lateral distance increased.
  - **Longitudinal TTC Calculation:**
    - TTC = 14.00 m / 4.12 m/s ≈ 3.40 seconds
  - **Lateral movement indicates a trajectory diverging from a potential collision path.**
  - **Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC):**
    - Since lateral separation is significant and increasing, no immediate risk in the lateral dimension.
    - MDC remains large given the continued lateral separation.

- **Risk Level:**
  - **Longitudinal Risk:** Medium Risk (3) due to TTC ≈ 3.4 seconds.
  - **Overall Risk:** Low Risk (4), increased lateral distance suggests diverging paths.

#### Obstacle 30693: Front
- **Most Recent Timestep Analysis (13.5 seconds):**
  - **Adjusted Distances:**
    - Longitudinal: 0.02 m
    - Lateral: 0.00 m
  - **Relative Velocity:**
    - Longitudinal: -2.31 m/s
    - Lateral: 0.00 m/s
  - **Relative Acceleration:**
    - Longitudinal: 0.76 m/s²
    - Lateral: 0.42 m/s²

- **Trajectory and Risk Assessment:**
  - This obstacle is critically close and on the exact lateral alignment.
  - Longitudinal distance decrease is significant, indicating converging trajectories.
  - **TTC Calculation:**
    - TTC = 0.02 m / 2.31 m/s ≈ 0.009 seconds
  - **MDC is approximately 0.02 m, pointing to an imminent collision.**

- **Risk Level:**
  - **Longitudinal Risk:** Collision (0) given the proximity and relatively high approaching speed.
  - **Overall Risk:** Collision (0)

### Collision Scenario Determination

Based on the above analysis:
- **Obstacle 30693** is already in a collision state with the ego vehicle due to near-zero longitudinal distance and short TTC with converging trajectories.

{
  "CollisionObstacle": {
    "ObstacleID": "30693",
    "OverallRiskScore": "0"
  },
  "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {
    "ObstacleID": null,
    "OverallRiskScore": null
  },
  "IsCollisionScenario": true,
  "Justification": "Obstacle 30693 is at an extremely close distance with no lateral separation and fast closing longitudinal trajectory. This represents an active collision with ego vehicle."
}
```

### Conclusion
The scenario involves a collision with Obstacle 30693 due to extremely short range and no effective evasive lateral movement. The collision scenario is confirmed primarily because of the outcome for this obstacle. Obstacle 30689 poses a significantly lower risk, contributing little to the immediate threat in this timestep.
