### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
    - Obstacle ID: 30689
    - Relative Direction: Front-left
    - Distance Risk Reason: DTClong is > 5 and has been consistently high over the past timesteps. DTClat is > 5 and has been increasing, indicating the obstacle is moving away laterally.
    - Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 5
    - Lateral Distance Safety Score: 5
    - Overall Distance Safety Score: 5.0
    - Time Risk Reason: TTClong is > 5 and has remained relatively stable over the past timesteps. TTClat is inf, further confirming no lateral risk.
    - Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 4
    - Lateral Time Safety Score: 5
    - Overall Time Safety Score: 4.5
    - Overall Risk Score: 5

    - Obstacle ID: 30693
    - Relative Direction: Front
    - Distance Risk Reason: DTClong is < 0.5 and has been decreasing rapidly over the past timesteps, indicating a high risk of longitudinal collision.  DTClat is 0, confirming no lateral offset.
    - Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 1
    - Lateral Distance Safety Score: 0
    - Overall Distance Safety Score: 1.0
    - Time Risk Reason: TTClong is < 0.5 and has been decreasing rapidly over the past timesteps, indicating imminent longitudinal collision risk. TTClat is 0 which means collision.
    - Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 1
    - Lateral Time Safety Score: 0
    - Overall Time Safety Score: 1.0
    - Overall Risk Score: 1


### Summary in JSON Format:  Summarize all obstacles with collision risk which Overall Risk Score is 0 and all obstacles with extreme risk which Overall Risk Score is 1 in the following JSON format. Make sure if they don't exist, set them as `null`:
```json
{
    "CollisionObstacle": null,
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "30693",
        "OverallRiskScore": "1"
    }
}
```
