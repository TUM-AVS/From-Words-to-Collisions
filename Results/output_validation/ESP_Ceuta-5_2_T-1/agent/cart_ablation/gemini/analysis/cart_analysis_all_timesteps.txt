Here's the collision risk analysis:

**Obstacle 31:** This obstacle is in a different lanelet (66985) than the ego vehicle (66725/66824), suggesting they are on different, non-intersecting paths. Although the obstacle has a high velocity, the lane separation indicates no immediate collision risk.  Risk score: 5 (Negligible risk).

**Obstacle 325:** This obstacle is in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle for most of the duration.  However, it's moving slightly slower than the ego vehicle, and the distance between them is increasing over time. Although they are in the same lane, the dynamics suggest a decreasing risk of collision. Risk score: 3 (Medium Risk).

**Obstacle 350:** This obstacle is also in a different lanelet (66823) from the ego vehicle, suggesting separate paths.  It poses no immediate threat of collision. Risk score: 5 (Negligible Risk).

**Obstacle 344:** This obstacle appears at t=0.6s in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle. The position and high speed are causes for concern, but it's unclear from the limited data whether its trajectory will intersect with the ego's. In the short-term, it's not an immediate collision risk, however further steps into the future would be needed to determine its true risk level due to the high closing velocity. Risk score: 3 (Medium risk)

**Predicted Extreme Risk Obstacle:** Given the trajectory of the ego vehicle and obstacle 344, there is a high likelihood of them colliding within the next few seconds. The limited horizon of the provided dataset limits an accurate prediction without additional timesteps. Given the high closing speeds and proximity within the same lane, obstacle 344 will be flagged as a predicted extreme risk.
