Obstacle 31: This obstacle is located in a different lanelet (66985) than the ego vehicle (66725/66824) throughout the entire duration. Its trajectory doesn't intersect with the ego vehicle's path. Therefore, the risk score is 5 (Negligible Risk).

Obstacle 325: This obstacle is in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle for the first 0.5 seconds (lanelet 66725).  While initially somewhat close to the ego vehicle and traveling faster, it decelerates throughout the timeframe.  The ego vehicle also decelerates and changes lanelets after 0.5 seconds, further reducing risk. Due to the decreasing velocities and the lane change, the risk is assessed as 4 (Low Risk).

Obstacle 350:  This obstacle is in a different lanelet (66823) than the ego vehicle for the entire time. It is consistently moving away from the ego vehicle. Its trajectory does not intersect the ego vehicle's path. Therefore, the risk is 5 (Negligible Risk).

Obstacle 344: This obstacle appears at 0.6 seconds in the same lanelet (66725) as the ego vehicle *was* in.  However, by the time this obstacle appears, the ego vehicle has already changed lanelets to 66824. While obstacle 344 is moving fast, it does not pose a risk given the lane separation.  The risk is assessed as 5 (Negligible Risk).
