Obstacle 325 is in the same lane as the ego vehicle and shows a decreasing velocity, however, it maintains a safe distance and its trajectory doesn't suggest an immediate collision risk. Obstacle 31 is in a different lane and poses no immediate risk. Obstacle 344, while in the same lane as the ego vehicle and having a higher velocity, is sufficiently far behind and doesn't represent an immediate risk. Obstacle 350 is in a different lane and poses no immediate risk.
