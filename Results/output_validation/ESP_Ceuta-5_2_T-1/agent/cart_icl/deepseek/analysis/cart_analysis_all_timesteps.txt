### Analysis:

1. **Obstacle 325.0**:
   - **Position**: (624.81574, 711.81826) at 1.0s, same lanelet as ego (66725.0).
   - **Velocity**: 8.399 m/s (similar direction as ego).
   - **Relative Motion**: Ego is accelerating (2.1506 m/sÂ²), but obstacle is ahead and moving faster. Distance is decreasing.
   - **TTC**: Estimated ~2.5s (based on relative velocity and distance).
   - **Risk**: **Medium (3)** - Manageable with driver/system response.

2. **Obstacle 344.0**:
   - **Position**: (643.55618, 706.85935) at 1.0s, same lanelet as ego (66725.0).
   - **Velocity**: 13.358 m/s (much faster than ego).
   - **Relative Motion**: Approaching from behind but lateral distance is significant (~6m).
   - **TTC**: Not immediate due to lateral separation.
   - **Risk**: **Low (4)** - No immediate danger.

3. **Obstacle 31.0**:
   - **Position**: (612.86732, 710.14351) at 1.0s, lanelet 66985.0 (adjacent lane)).
   - **Velocity**: 11.597 m/s (faster than ego).
   - **Relative Motion**: Moving laterally away from ego.
   - **TTC**: Not applicable (diverging paths).
   - **Risk**: **Negligible (5)** - No meaningful risk.

4. **Obstacle 350.0**:
   - **Position**: (595.72186, 698.17909) at 1.0s, lanelet 66823.0 (different lane).
   - **Velocity**: 5.816 m/s (slower than ego).
   - **Relative Motion**: Moving away from ego.
   - **TTC**: Not applicable.
   - **Risk**: **Negligible (5)** - No meaningful risk.

### Highest Risks:
- No collision or extreme risk obstacles identified.
- **Obstacle 325.0** is the highest risk but still manageable (**Medium Risk (3)**).
