**Analysis:**

To determine the risk levels for each obstacle, I'll analyze their trajectories, relative positions, and velocities compared to the ego vehicle at the most recent timestep (1.0 seconds).

1. **Ego (ID: 1.0)** is moving slowly with a velocity of \(1.6869\) m/s, having decelerated significantly over the time period and recently accelerated. It’s currently on lanelet 66824.0.

2. **Obstacle (ID: 31.0):**
   - Position: \((612.86732, 710.14351)\), Orientation: 0.0738644
   - Velocity: \(11.5971\) m/s
   - Currently located in lanelet 66985.0.
   - Relative to Ego: It is ahead and to the right of the ego vehicle. The lateral separation seems significant.
   - **Risk Level:** 4 (Low Risk) as they are not in the same lane and separation is considerable.

3. **Obstacle (ID: 325.0):**
   - Position: \((624.81574, 711.81826)\), Orientation: 2.8760765
   - Velocity: \(8.3992\) m/s
   - In the same lanelet as Ego (66725.0 previously but mainly analyzed on 66824.0 now).
   - Relative to Ego: It appears to be ahead of the ego vehicle with lateral proximity.
   - **Risk Level:** 3 (Medium Risk) due to same lane proximity, but currently manageable.

4. **Obstacle (ID: 344.0):**
   - Position: \((643.55618, 706.85935)\), Orientation: 2.8948465
   - Velocity: \(13.3583\) m/s
   - Located in lanelet 66725.0.
   - This obstacle is faster and on a different lane, not in immediate conflict with the ego’s path.
   - **Risk Level:** 4 (Low Risk)

5. **Obstacle (ID: 350.0):**
   - Position: \((595.72186, 698.17909)\), Orientation: 4.5023811
   - Velocity: \(5.8156\) m/s
   - Located in lanelet 66823.0.
   - This vehicle is moving consistently slower and is distant from the ego vehicle with a trajectory that does not currently intersect with Ego’s path.
   - **Risk Level:** 5 (Negligible Risk)

The closest and most aligned with the Ego’s lane trajectory is **Obstacle 325**. Given its proximity and relative motion, it requires consideration but remains at a manageable risk with appropriate system responses.

**JSON Output:**

```json
{
    "CollisionObstacles": [],
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {},
    "HighRiskObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "325",
        "OverallRiskScore": 2
    }
}
```

This JSON summarizes the highest risk identified in the current scenario for obstacle ID 325 with a high risk due to potential trajectory alignment. Other obstacles do not present immediate risks based on the last available data.
