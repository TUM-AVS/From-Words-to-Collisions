At t=1.0s, Obstacle 31 is at a longitudinal distance of 1.75m and a lateral distance of 3.37m.  Its combined distance, using the Pythagorean theorem, is approximately 3.8m. It is approaching the ego vehicle rapidly, longitudinally at -12.5 m/s and laterally at -4.2 m/s. While a collision is not guaranteed, the short distance and high closing speeds present an extremely high risk. For the purposes of this assessment, let us consider that the MDC and TTC for obstacle 31 would qualify for risk scores of 1. Hence, obstacle 31 poses an Extreme risk.

Obstacle 325 is practically touching the ego vehicle longitudinally (-0.17m) and at 0 lateral distance, indicating an imminent collision.  The relative longitudinal velocity of 6.71 m/s further confirms this. Thus, Obstacle 325 represents a collision risk.  MDC and TTC for obstacle 325 would have a risk score of 0.

Obstacle 344 is at a safe longitudinal distance behind the ego vehicle (-19.54m) and zero lateral distance. Its relative velocity suggests it's approaching the ego vehicle, but the substantial distance provides ample time to react.  MDC and TTC for obstacle 344 would have a risk score of 5.

Obstacle 350, despite being closer longitudinally (14.64m) compared to 344, exhibits a significant lateral distance (19.83m) and is moving away laterally at 5.79m/s.  This trajectory poses no immediate risk. Thus, obstacle 350 represents a Negligible risk. MDC and TTC for obstacle 350 would have a risk score of 5.
