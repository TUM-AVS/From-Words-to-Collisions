Obstacle 31 is in the Front-left of the ego car. The real distance is longitudinal 1.75 m and lateral 3.37 m. It is very close to the ego vehicle and moving towards it both longitudinally and laterally with a high relative longitudinal velocity of -12.50 m/s and lateral velocity of -4.20 m/s. This indicates an extremely high risk of collision. Risk score: 1 (Extreme Risk).

Obstacle 325 is in the Behind of the ego car. The real distance is longitudinal -0.17 m and lateral 0.00 m. The longitudinal distance is very small, close to collision. Although the relative longitudinal velocity is positive (6.71 m/s) indicating that obstacle 325 is moving away from the ego car longitudinally from behind, the small distance suggests a possible collision. The lateral alignment and small longitudinal distance raise concerns. Risk score: 1 (Extreme Risk).

Obstacle 344 is in the Behind of the ego car. The real distance is longitudinal -19.54 m and lateral 0.00 m.  While it is approaching the ego vehicle from behind with a relatively high longitudinal velocity (11.65 m/s), the distance is still relatively safe. Risk score: 3 (Medium Risk).

Obstacle 350 is in the Front-left of the ego car. The real distance is longitudinal 14.64 m and lateral 19.83 m. While it is moving towards the ego vehicle longitudinally (-2.19 m/s), it is moving away laterally (5.79 m/s) and the distances are relatively large, suggesting a low risk of collision. Risk score: 4 (Low Risk).


Risk Levels:
0: Collision - Physical contact occurred or unavoidable
1: Extreme Risk - Immediate collision likely
2: High Risk - Close to collision, needs quick action
3: Medium Risk - Manageable with proper reaction
4: Low Risk - Minimal risk, sufficient time to react
5: Negligible Risk - No significant risk
