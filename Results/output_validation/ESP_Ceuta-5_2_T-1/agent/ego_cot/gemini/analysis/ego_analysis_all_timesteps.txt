### Safety analysis for timestep 1.0s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

Obstacle 31 exhibits the highest risk. At t=1.0s, the longitudinal and lateral distances are both 1.75m, and the relative velocities indicate it is rapidly approaching the ego vehicle from the front-left (-12.50 m/s longitudinally and -4.20 m/s laterally). This combination of proximity and converging trajectory suggests a near-certain collision within the next time step.  Obstacle 325 is also at extreme risk; the longitudinal distance is -0.17 m, and the relative velocity is 6.71 m/s; itâ€™s very likely that the collision will occur before the next time step. Obstacle 344 and 350 poses no immediate threat.



### Obstacle Analysis:
- **Obstacle ID:** 31
- **Distance Risk reason:** Extremely close proximity (1.75m longitudinally and laterally) and approaching from the front-left.
- **Distance safety score:** 1
- **Time Risk reason:** Very short TTC due to high closing velocity (-12.5 m/s longitudinally, -4.2 m/s laterally) indicating likely collision in the immediate future.
- **Time safety score:** 1
- **Overall Risk score:** 1

- **Obstacle ID:** 325
- **Distance Risk reason:** Extremely close proximity (-0.17m longitudinally) and approaching from behind.
- **Distance safety score:** 0
- **Time Risk reason:** Collision is imminent due to negative longitudinal distance and positive relative longitudinal velocity.
- **Time safety score:** 0
- **Overall Risk score:** 0

- **Obstacle ID:** 344
- **Distance Risk reason:**  Relatively far (-19.54 m longitudinally and laterally) and approaching from behind.
- **Distance safety score:** 5
- **Time Risk reason:** Sufficient time to react due to the distance and relative velocity (11.65 m/s longitudinally, 0.67 m/s laterally).
- **Time safety score:** 5
- **Overall Risk score:** 5

- **Obstacle ID:** 350
- **Distance Risk reason:** Relatively far (14.64 m longitudinally and laterally) and positioned to the front-left. While the longitudinal distance suggests some risk, the lateral movement and distance mitigates it.
- **Distance safety score:** 5
- **Time Risk reason:** Ample time to react given the distance and relative velocity (-2.19 m/s longitudinally, 5.79 m/s laterally).
- **Time safety score:** 5
- **Overall Risk score:** 5
