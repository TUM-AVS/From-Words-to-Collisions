* **Obstacle 31 Analysis:**

This obstacle is approaching the ego vehicle from the front-left.  Over the past second, both its longitudinal and lateral distances have been rapidly decreasing.

At t=1.0s:
- Longitudinal distance: 1.75m
- Lateral distance: 3.37m
- Longitudinal velocity: -12.50 m/s (approaching)
- Lateral velocity: -4.20 m/s (approaching)

Longitudinal TTC = 1.75m / 12.50m/s = 0.14s
Lateral TTC = 3.37m / 4.20m/s = 0.80s

MDC is difficult to precisely calculate without path projections, but given the close proximity and high closing velocities in both dimensions, it is likely less than 0.5m.

Risk Assessment:  Both TTC (longitudinal) and MDC suggest **Extreme Risk (1)**.

* **Obstacle 325 Analysis:**

This obstacle is approaching the ego vehicle from directly behind and is in the same lane (lateral distance = 0.00m). This obstacle exhibits concerning behavior: it maintains exact lateral alignment with the ego vehicle while rapidly closing the longitudinal distance.  

At t=1.0s:
- Longitudinal distance: -0.17m (almost touching bumpers)
- Longitudinal velocity: 6.71 m/s (approaching rapidly)

Longitudinal TTC = 0.17m / 6.71m/s = 0.025s

MDC â‰ˆ 0m (practically touching)

Risk Assessment: Both TTC and MDC indicate an **imminent Collision (0)**.

* **Obstacle 344 Analysis:**

This obstacle is approaching from behind, similar to Obstacle 325, and also maintains exact lateral alignment. However, it is much further away.

At t=1.0s:
- Longitudinal distance: -19.54m
- Longitudinal velocity: 11.65 m/s (approaching)

Longitudinal TTC = 19.54m / 11.65m/s = 1.68s

MDC is not relevant here as the obstacle is directly behind.  

Risk Assessment: Based on TTC, this is a **Medium Risk (3)**.

* **Obstacle 350 Analysis:**

This obstacle is in the front-left quadrant, but while it is closing longitudinally, it is moving away laterally.

At t=1.0s:
- Longitudinal distance: 14.64m
- Lateral distance: 19.83m
- Longitudinal velocity: -2.19 m/s (approaching)
- Lateral velocity: 5.79 m/s (diverging)

Longitudinal TTC = 14.64m / 2.19m/s = 6.68s

Lateral motion is diverging, so lateral TTC is not relevant for collision risk.

Risk Assessment:  Based on the trajectory and longitudinal TTC, this is **Negligible Risk (5)**.
