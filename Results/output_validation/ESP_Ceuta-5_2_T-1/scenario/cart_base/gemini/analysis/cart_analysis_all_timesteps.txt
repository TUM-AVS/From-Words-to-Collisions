At t=1.2s, Ego is in lanelet 66824.

Obstacle 31 (lanelet 66985) is far and poses negligible risk.

Obstacle 325 (lanelet 66725) is in a different lanelet than Ego but is relatively close.  Analyzing the trajectories, both Ego and Obstacle 325 appear to have been in the same lanelet (66725) previously.  While Ego has since changed lanelets and Obstacle 325's lateral movement isn't significant, caution is needed. Risk score: 3 (Medium Risk).

Obstacle 344 (lanelet 66725)  poses a higher risk. It is in the same lanelet that Ego was in moments before, and is moving significantly faster than Ego. Although there is lateral separation now due to Ego's lane change, this situation needs careful monitoring. Risk score: 2 (High Risk).

Obstacle 350 (lanelet 66823) is far and poses negligible risk.
