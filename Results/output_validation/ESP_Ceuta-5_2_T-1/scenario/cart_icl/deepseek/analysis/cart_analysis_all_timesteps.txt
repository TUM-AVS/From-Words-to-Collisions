### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep (1.2 seconds):

### Obstacle Analysis:

#### Obstacle ID: 31.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is moving away from the ego vehicle (increasing X distance over time). Current distance is ~4.8m (longitudinal) and ~5.1m (lateral).
- **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- **Time Risk reason**: Relative velocity is high (~9.2 m/s), but obstacle is moving away with increasing distance.
- **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 325.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is in the same lanelet as ego and approaching (distance decreasing from ~2.5m to ~1.8m over last timesteps). Current distance is ~1.8m.
- **Distance safety score**: 2 (High Risk)
- **Time Risk reason**: Relative velocity is ~6.1 m/s with TTC ~0.3s. Acceleration trends show obstacle is decelerating but still closing distance.
- **Time safety score**: 2 (High Risk)
- **Overall Risk score**: 2

#### Obstacle ID: 344.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is moving away from ego (distance increasing from ~12m to ~19m over timesteps). Current distance is ~19m.
- **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- **Time Risk reason**: High relative velocity (~10.8 m/s) but moving away with increasing distance.
- **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 350.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is moving away (distance increasing from ~24.7m to ~24.5m). Current distance is ~24.5m.
- **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- **Time Risk reason**: Relative velocity is ~2.7 m/s with obstacle moving away.
- **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. Ego vehicle is in lanelet 66824.0 at 1.2s
2. Only obstacle 325.0 is in same/similar lanelet (66725.0) and showing concerning proximity
3. Distance to 325.0 is decreasing (1.8m) with TTC ~0.3s
4. Other obstacles are either moving away or at safe distances
5. No actual collision has occurred yet
6. Situation requires monitoring but no immediate collision
