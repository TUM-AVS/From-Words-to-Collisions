### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 31.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is in a different lane and moving away from the ego vehicle.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason:  Relative velocity suggests no immediate risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 325.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is in the same lane and moving in a similar direction but slightly slower than the ego vehicle, increasing distance.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: The relative velocities and accelerations suggest decreasing risk of collision.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- Obstacle ID: 344.0
- Distance Risk reason:  This obstacle is in the same lane, behind the ego vehicle, but traveling significantly faster and rapidly approaching.
- Distance safety score: 2
- Time Risk reason: The high closing speed based on relative velocity and acceleration poses a high risk.
- Time safety score: 2
- Overall Risk score: 2

- Obstacle ID: 350.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is in a different lane and moving further away from the ego vehicle.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: No risk based on relative velocity and direction.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5


### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. **Initial Assessment**: At t=1.2s, Obstacle 344 is in the same lane and approaching the ego vehicle rapidly from behind.
2. **Trajectory Analysis**: Observing the past trajectories, obstacle 344 first appears at t=0.6s, and its high closing speed suggests a potential collision risk if this trend continues.
3. **Collision Possibility**: Without intervention, obstacle 344 might collide with the ego vehicle.

### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
  "CollisionObstacles": [],
  "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null,
  "ScenarioAnalysis": {
    "IsCollisionScenario": false,
    "Reasoning": "No obstacle has a risk score of 0, indicating no immediate collision. However, Obstacle 344 presents a high risk (score 2) due to its high closing speed from behind in the same lane and requires attention."
  }
