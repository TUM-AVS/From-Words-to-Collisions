### Obstacle Analysis at 1.2 Seconds:

#### Obstacle: 31
- **Distance Risk reason:** Position data over 10 timesteps show obstacle 31 moving parallel in a different lanelet without convergence towards the ego's trajectory. Although it's close, the trajectory isn't indicating a merge or path alignment towards the ego.
- **Distance safety score:** 4
- **Time Risk reason:** Constant velocity and minor acceleration changes observed; obstacle consistently moved in a parallel lane and maintained a safe distance.
- **Time safety score:** 5
- **Overall Risk score:** 5

#### Obstacle: 325
- **Distance Risk reason:** Despite sharing the initial lanelet with the ego vehicle, obstacle 325 shows divergence in movement patterns and continues in a straight path without intersecting the ego's trajectory.
- **Distance safety score:** 4
- **Time Risk reason:** Consistent slowdown trend and stable trajectory suggest maintained distancing from the ego over time.
- **Time safety score:** 4
- **Overall Risk score:** 4

#### Obstacle: 344
- **Distance Risk reason:** Located in a separate lanelet throughout; maintained a fast pace but without lateral movements threatening the ego vehicle.
- **Distance safety score:** 4
- **Time Risk reason:** Maintained high velocity but showed a consistent trajectory apart from the ego's path, indicating no immediate threat.
- **Time safety score:** 4
- **Overall Risk score:** 4

#### Obstacle: 350
- **Distance Risk reason:** Remains in a different lanelet throughout the observation period. Consistent orientation divergence minimizes direct collision risks.
- **Distance safety score:** 5
- **Time Risk reason:** Despite deceleration, it's on a separate course, reducing any likelihood of threat to the ego even if speeds were to decrease.
- **Time safety score:** 5
- **Overall Risk score:** 5

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
None of the obstacles pose significant collision risks for the given timestep with the ego vehicle. The closest threats (31 and 325) maintain separate trajectories or lanelets from the ego and their velocities suggest no immediate collision trajectory. Overall, all indicators like consistent lanes and velocities favor a non-collision scenario.
