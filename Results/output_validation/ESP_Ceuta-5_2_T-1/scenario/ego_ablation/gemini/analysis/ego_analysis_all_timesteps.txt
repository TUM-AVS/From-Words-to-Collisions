Obstacle 31 is positioned to the left of the ego vehicle, with a longitudinal distance of 0.00 m and a lateral distance of 2.74 m. Although there is no longitudinal separation, the lateral distance suggests a near miss or a potential sideswipe.  The relative velocity indicates Obstacle 31 is moving alongside the ego vehicle longitudinally (-13.67 m/s) and slightly towards it laterally (-2.82 m/s).

Obstacle 325 shows a collision with the ego vehicle, indicated by both longitudinal and lateral distances being 0.00 m. This confirms a collision has occurred in this timestep.

Obstacle 344, located behind the ego vehicle at a longitudinal distance of -17.23 m, poses no immediate threat.

Obstacle 350, positioned to the front-left of the ego vehicle, is not a risk due to a large real distance.

Due to the collision with Obstacle 325, this is a collision scenario.
