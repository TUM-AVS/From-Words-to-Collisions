### Safety analysis for timestep 0.3s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 31
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 31 is at 9.98m longitudinally and laterally, approaching from the front-left. This represents a potential collision risk, especially given its motion towards the ego vehicle.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: The closing velocities (-9.18 m/s longitudinal, -8.97 m/s lateral) suggest a high risk of collision within the next second.
- Time safety score: 2
- Overall Risk score: 2

- Obstacle ID: 325
- Distance Risk reason: At -4.94m longitudinally, this obstacle is very close behind the ego vehicle and poses a significant collision risk.
- Distance safety score: 2
- Time Risk reason: Although the longitudinal closing velocity is positive (6.65 m/s), the small distance suggests limited time to react, making a collision likely.
- Time safety score: 2
- Overall Risk score: 2

- Obstacle ID: 350
- Distance Risk reason: While the longitudinal distance (17.42m) is moderate, the lateral motion away from the ego vehicle mitigates the risk.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: The longitudinal closing velocity (-2.04 m/s) is small, and the lateral velocity (8.12 m/s) indicates divergence, further lowering the risk.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

### Safety analysis for timestep 0.4s through 1.1s (Abbreviated):
*Analysis for each timestep would follow a similar structure to 0.3s, updating the TTC, MDC, and risk scores based on the changing distances and velocities.*  Obstacle 31 consistently poses a high and increasing risk, with both distance and closing velocities decreasing rapidly. Obstacle 325 continues to close from behind, culminating in a collision at 1.1s. Obstacle 350 maintains a safe distance and trajectory.

### Safety analysis for timestep 1.2s:
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 31
- Distance Risk reason: Collision has occurred longitudinally (0.00m).
- Distance safety score: 0
- Time Risk reason: N/A (collision has already happened)
- Time safety score: 0
- Overall Risk score: 0

- Obstacle ID: 325
- Distance Risk reason: Collision has occurred (0.00m longitudinally and laterally).
- Distance safety score: 0
- Time Risk reason: N/A
- Time safety score: 0
- Overall Risk score: 0

- Obstacle ID: 344
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 344 is behind the ego vehicle at -17.23m, but approaching. While the risk is currently low, monitoring is necessary.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason:  Longitudinal closing velocity (10.79 m/s) warrants attention despite the distance.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3

- Obstacle ID: 350
- Distance Risk reason: Safe distance longitudinally (14.22m) and moving laterally away.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Low longitudinal closing velocity (-2.86 m/s) and diverging lateral velocity (5.14 m/s).
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 5
