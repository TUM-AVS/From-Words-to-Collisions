### Obstacle Analysis

#### Obstacle 31
- **Location:** Front-left
- **Adjusted Distances:** Longitudinal 0.47m, Lateral 3.05m
- **Relative Velocities:** Longitudinal -13.21 m/s, Lateral -3.67 m/s
- **Analysis:**
  - Trajectory: Decreasing both longitudinal and lateral distances towards the ego vehicle.
  - **Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC):** Given the adjusted longitudinal distance is 0.47m which is almost zero, and a high closing velocity, MDC is very low, at around 0.47m.
  - **Time-to-Collision (TTC):** Longitudinal TTC = 0.47 m / 13.21 m/s ≈ 0.036 seconds.
  - **Risk Assessment:** Due to the extremely short TTC and low MDC, this obstacle merits a risk score of 1 (Extreme Risk).

#### Obstacle 325
- **Location:** Collision
- **Adjusted Distances:** Longitudinal 0.00m, Lateral 0.00m
- **Relative Velocities:** Longitudinal 6.11 m/s, Lateral 0.24 m/s
- **Analysis:**
  - The obstacle's position indicates it is currently colliding with the ego vehicle.
  - **Risk Assessment:** Due to the obstacle's exact alignment at position zero in both dimensions, this is a clear collision condition resulting in a risk score of 0 (Collision).

#### Obstacle 344
- **Location:** Behind
- **Adjusted Distances:** Longitudinal -17.23m, Lateral 0.00m
- **Relative Velocities:** Longitudinal 10.79 m/s (closing), Lateral 0.57 m/s
- **Analysis:**
  - While this obstacle is closing fast, its proximity is still significant, and it is not in the same lane.
  - **Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC):** Significant due to negative longitudinal distance, not an immediate threat.
  - **Time-to-Collision (TTC):** Longitudinal TTC = 17.23 m / 10.79 m/s ≈ 1.60 seconds.
  - **Risk Assessment:** Medium risk level due to relatively broad distance and closing velocity, resulting in a risk score of 3 (Medium Risk).

#### Obstacle 350
- **Location:** Front-left
- **Adjusted Distances:** Longitudinal 14.22m, Lateral 20.91m
- **Relative Velocities:** Longitudinal -2.86 m/s, Lateral 5.14 m/s
- **Analysis:**
  - The obstacle is moving away laterally, which minimizes collision risk.
  - **Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC):** Large due to both distances.
  - **Time-to-Collision (TTC):** Both TTC values exceed the 5-second threshold due to increasing lateral and broad longitudinal separation.
  - **Risk Assessment:** No immediate risk, leading to a risk score of 5.

### Conclusion

Given the detailed analysis above, the scenario does qualify as a collision scenario due to the presence of Obstacle 325 colliding with the ego vehicle, evidenced by the zero distance in both dimensions.
