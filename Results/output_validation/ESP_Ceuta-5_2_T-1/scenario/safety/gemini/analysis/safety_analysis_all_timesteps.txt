### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 31
- Relative Direction: Left
- Distance Risk Reason: DTClong is 0.0m indicating a collision longitudinally.  DTClat is 2.74m, a high lateral risk, and has been decreasing over time. The obstacle has transitioned from Front-left to Left in this timestep, meaning the longitudinal collision has just occurred.
- Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 0
- Lateral Distance Safety Score: 3
- Overall Distance Safety Score: 3.0  (0 * 0.0 + 3 * (1 - 0.0))
- Time Risk Reason: TTClong is 0.0s, indicating collision. TTClat is 0.97s, posing a high risk, and has been generally increasing.
- Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 0
- Lateral Time Safety Score: 2
- Overall Time Safety Score: 2.0 (0 * 0.0 + 2 * (1 - 0.0))
- Overall Risk Score: 3 (0.5 * 3 + 0.5 * 2 = 2.5, rounded to 3)

- Obstacle ID: 325
- Relative Direction: Behind
- Distance Risk Reason:  DTClong is 0.0m, indicating a collision. DTClat is 0.0m, also indicating a collision. This aligns with the "Collision" state reported for this obstacle.
- Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 0
- Lateral Distance Safety Score: 0
- Overall Distance Safety Score: 0.0 (0 * 1.0 + 0 * (1 - 1.0))
- Time Risk Reason: TTClong and TTClat are both 0.0s, confirming the collision state.
- Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 0
- Lateral Time Safety Score: 0
- Overall Time Safety Score: 0.0 (0 * 1.0 + 0 * (1 - 1.0))
- Overall Risk Score: 0 (0.5 * 0 + 0.5 * 0 = 0)

- Obstacle ID: 344
- Relative Direction: Behind
- Distance Risk Reason: DTClong is -17.23m, indicating the obstacle is behind the ego vehicle and relatively far.  DTClat is 0.0, which means it is directly behind in the same lane. It has been getting closer over time.
- Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 5
- Lateral Distance Safety Score: 0
- Overall Distance Safety Score: 5.0 (5 * 1.0 + 0 * (1 - 1.0))
- Time Risk Reason: TTClong is 1.60s, a medium risk and decreasing over time, and TTClat is 0.0s.
- Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 3
- Lateral Time Safety Score: 0
- Overall Time Safety Score: 3.0 (3 * 1.0 + 0 * (1 - 1.0))
- Overall Risk Score: 4 (0.5 * 5 + 0.5 * 3 = 4)

- Obstacle ID: 350
- Relative Direction: Front-left
- Distance Risk Reason: DTClong is 14.22m and DTClat is 20.91m, both indicating negligible risk and have been decreasing over time while increasing lat.
- Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 5
- Lateral Distance Safety Score: 5
- Overall Distance Safety Score: 5.0 (5 * 0.5 + 5 * (1 - 0.5))
- Time Risk Reason: TTClong is 4.98s, representing a low risk. TTClat is infinite, indicating no lateral collision risk.  TTClong has been decreasing over time.
- Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 4
- Lateral Time Safety Score: 5
- Overall Time Safety Score: 4.5 (4 * 0.5 + 5 * (1 - 0.5))
- Overall Risk Score: 5 (0.5 * 5 + 0.5 * 4.5 = 4.75, rounded to 5)
