Obstacle 3044: This obstacle is in the same lane as the ego vehicle and is moving at a slightly higher velocity.  The distance between the ego and obstacle 3044 is decreasing over the provided timesteps, indicating a potential risk. While the distance is not extremely close yet, the trend suggests a high risk of collision if the ego vehicle does not react or if the obstacle continues to accelerate.  The fluctuations in acceleration of obstacle 3044 make prediction slightly challenging. Given the closing distance and the relatively short timeframe, a risk score of 2 (High Risk) is assigned.

Obstacle 3045: This obstacle is further ahead of the ego vehicle than obstacle 3044 and in the same lane.  While its velocity is also higher than the ego vehicle's, its distance and the observed trend across the timesteps suggest that an immediate collision is less likely than with obstacle 3044.  Therefore, this obstacle poses a medium risk, considering the possibility of unforeseen changes in the obstacle's behavior. Given the current distance and velocity difference, sufficient time and space likely exist for the ego vehicle to react and avoid collision.  The fluctuating acceleration of obstacle 3045 makes it difficult to predict precisely. A more conservative risk score of 2 (High Risk) seems prudent.
