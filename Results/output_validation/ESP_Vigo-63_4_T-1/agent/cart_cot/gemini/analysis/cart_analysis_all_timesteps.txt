At timestep 8.1 seconds, both obstacles 3044 and 3045 are moving in roughly the same direction as the ego vehicle, within the same lanelet.  Obstacle 3044 is closer to the ego vehicle than 3045.

While the provided data doesn't directly give TTC or MDC, we can infer risk based on positions, velocities, and accelerations.  Obstacle 3044 shows a decreasing distance to the ego vehicle over multiple timesteps and its velocity and acceleration are not significantly different to the ego vehicle which suggests some level of risk. Obstacle 3045 is further away and does not appear to pose an immediate threat. A more precise risk assessment would require calculating TTC and MDC. Based on the available information:

Obstacle 3044 is assessed as a medium risk (3) due to its proximity and  relative motion.
Obstacle 3045 is assessed as a low risk (4) due to greater distance, despite some acceleration.
