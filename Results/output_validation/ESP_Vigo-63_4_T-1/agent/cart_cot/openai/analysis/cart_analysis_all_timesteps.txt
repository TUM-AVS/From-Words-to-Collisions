At the final timestep of 8.1 seconds, we evaluate the ego vehicle and obstacles 3044.0 and 3045.0. The goal is to understand their relative trajectories and potential risks for collision.

### Analysis:
- **Ego Vehicle (3040.0)** is consistently moving at a steady velocity of 6.9567 m/s with no acceleration, maintaining a straight path in lanelet 223.0.

- **Obstacle 3044.0** is moving slightly faster than the ego vehicle at 7.8921 m/s with minimal acceleration (0.0989 m/sÂ²). The obstacle maintains a close trajectory to the ego vehicle but without sharp changes in speed or direction. Given they share a lanelet and are in close proximity, the risk must be evaluated, but with consistent speeds and close parallel positioning, it is less immediate.

- **Obstacle 3045.0** maintains a slightly faster trajectory at 7.897 m/s compared to the ego vehicle. It exhibits minor acceleration and subtle orientation change (2.7055 radians). However, it is positioned further away from the ego vehicle in comparison to the near obstacle and moves steadily in the same lanelet.

### Risk Evaluation:
- **Time to Collision (TTC):** Considering steady speeds and parallel courses, the TTC must be assessed over more extended periods, indicating that both obstacles are close but not in immediate collision paths. The slight velocity advantage they hold warrants careful monitoring.

- **Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC):** Between obstacle 3044 and the ego vehicle appears minimal, necessitating a higher risk score, but manageable given no drastic trajectory changes. Obstacle 3045 poses a reduced risk due to its greater distance despite being in the same lane.

After analyzing the context, Obstacle 3044 presents a higher threat level due to immediate proximity and orientation parallel to the ego vehicle. Therefore, the overall risk score for 3044 is higher compared to 3045, despite both being in the same lanelet. However, none appear to necessitate an extreme or physical collision.
