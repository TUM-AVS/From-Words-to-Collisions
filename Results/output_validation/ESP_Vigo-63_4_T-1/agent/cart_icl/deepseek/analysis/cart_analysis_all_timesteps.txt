### Analysis:

1. **Obstacle 3044.0**:
   - **Position**: At 8.1s, the obstacle is at (422.208, -160.7195), while the ego is at (417.7158, -158.6708).
   - **Relative Distance**: The longitudinal distance is approximately 4.49m (ego is behind), and the lateral distance is approximately 2.05m.
   - **Velocity**: Obstacle velocity is 7.8921 m/s, ego velocity is 6.9567 m/s. The relative velocity is 0.9354 m/s (obstacle is moving away).
   - **TTC**: Not applicable since the obstacle is moving away.
   - **Risk**: **Low Risk (4)** as the obstacle is moving away and the lateral distance is sufficient.

2. **Obstacle 3045.0**:
   - **Position**: At 8.1s, the obstacle is at (436.2695, -167.1574), while the ego is at (417.7158, -158.6708).
   - **Relative Distance**: The longitudinal distance is approximately 18.55m (ego is behind), and the lateral distance is approximately 8.49m.
   - **Velocity**: Obstacle velocity is 7.897 m/s, ego velocity is 6.9567 m/s. The relative velocity is 0.9403 m/s (obstacle is moving away).
   - **TTC**: Not applicable since the obstacle is moving away.
   - **Risk**: **Negligible Risk (5)** as the obstacle is far ahead and moving away.
