Obstacle 3044 is showing a decreasing trend in distance to the ego vehicle over the provided timesteps. At the last timestep (8.1s), it's approximately 5.5 meters away longitudinally and exhibiting a slightly higher velocity.  While the lateral distance isn't provided, both are in the same lanelet, suggesting potential risk if the trend continues. It requires careful monitoring.

Obstacle 3045 is further away longitudinally but also exhibits higher velocity and acceleration compared to the ego vehicle. Its lateral movement and the lack of precise lateral distance information make it difficult to accurately gauge the risk, but it should be monitored.
