To analyze the given scenario, we'll review the data from the most recent timestamp at 8.1 seconds, comparing the positions and velocities of the ego vehicle and the obstacles to determine collision risk.

### Detailed Analysis at 8.1 seconds:

1. **Ego (3040.0):** 
   - Position: (417.7158, -158.6708)
   - Velocity: 6.9567 m/s
   - Lanelet: 223.0

2. **Obstacle (3044.0):**
   - Position: (422.208, -160.7195)
   - Velocity: 7.8921 m/s
   - Lanelet: 223.0

   **Analysis:**
   - The obstacle is in the same lanelet and slightly ahead of the ego vehicle.
   - The lateral distance is approximately 2.05 meters.
   - The relative longitudinal position is about 4.49 meters ahead (`422.208 - 417.7158`), indicating it is overtaking.
   - The relative velocity is approximately 0.9354 m/s (`7.8921 - 6.9567`), meaning this obstacle is slightly faster and the distance is increasing.
   - **Risk Assessment:** No immediate risk; hence Risk Level 4.

3. **Obstacle (3045.0):**
   - Position: (436.2695, -167.1574)
   - Velocity: 7.897 m/s
   - Lanelet: 223.0

   **Analysis:**
   - This obstacle is significantly ahead of the ego vehicle.
   - The lateral distance is about 8.49 meters.
   - The longitudinal position relative to the ego is approximately 18.55 meters ahead (`436.2695 - 417.7158`).
   - The relative velocity is 0.9403 m/s (`7.897 - 6.9567`), making the obstacle maintain its lead.
   - **Risk Assessment:** No immediate risk; hence Risk Level 5.

Given these calculations and observations, neither of the obstacles presents an immediate collision risk. Both obstacles maintain or increase their distance relative to the ego vehicle, and lateral proximities are within safe boundaries.

### Output JSON:

```json
{
    "CollisionObstacles": [],
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {},
    "HighRiskObstacle": {}
}
```

In this scenario, there are no collision or extreme/high-risk obstacles.
