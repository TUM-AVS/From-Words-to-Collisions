At timestep 8.1 seconds, Obstacle 3044 is at a longitudinal distance of -0.43 meters behind the ego vehicle and has a relative longitudinal velocity of 0.94 m/s towards the ego vehicle. This is an extremely dangerous situation. The MDC is less than 0.5 meters, suggesting an imminent collision.  Given the relative velocity, the TTC is also very low, likely less than 0.5 seconds. Thus, Obstacle 3044 represents an Extreme Risk (Overall Risk Score 1) due to its very close proximity, near-zero MDC, and near-zero TTC.

Obstacle 3045, while still behind the ego vehicle at -15.89 meters, maintains a longitudinal velocity of 0.94 m/s towards the ego. Although the relative acceleration is 0 for this timestep, its constant motion towards the ego, along with its calculated MDC and TTC, present no immediate danger but should still be monitored. This situation suggests a Medium Risk (Overall Risk Score 3).
