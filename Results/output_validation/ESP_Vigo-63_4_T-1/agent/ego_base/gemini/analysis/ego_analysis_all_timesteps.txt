Obstacle 3044 is very close to the ego vehicle, with a longitudinal distance of -0.43 meters.  The relative velocity indicates it is approaching at 0.94 m/s. While the relative acceleration has decreased, the short distance and relatively high closing speed pose an immediate collision risk. This classifies obstacle 3044 as an Extreme Risk (Risk Score 1).

Obstacle 3045 is further away at -15.89 meters, also approaching the ego vehicle with a longitudinal relative velocity of 0.94 m/s. The relative acceleration is approximately zero. Given the distance and current speed, there is sufficient time to react, placing this obstacle in a lower risk category. However, given the closing speed, and depending upon the reaction time, and future possible acceleration towards the ego car by 3045, there is chance of collision so it is classified as high risk.


Risk Levels:
0: Collision - Physical contact occurred or unavoidable
1: Extreme Risk - Immediate collision likely
2: High Risk - Close to collision, needs quick action
3: Medium Risk - Manageable with proper reaction
4: Low Risk - Minimal risk, sufficient time to react
5: Negligible Risk - No significant risk
