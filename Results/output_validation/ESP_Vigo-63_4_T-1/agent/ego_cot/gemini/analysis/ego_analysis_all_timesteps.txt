### Safety analysis for timestep 8.1s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

Obstacle 3044 is very close behind the ego vehicle and approaching rapidly.  Obstacle 3045, while also behind, is much further away and poses less immediate risk. The primary concern is Obstacle 3044, which is on a collision course with the ego vehicle.

### Obstacle Analysis:

**- Obstacle ID: 3044**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 3044 is extremely close (-0.43m longitudinally and -0.43m laterally) and directly behind the ego vehicle.  This indicates a very high risk of collision.
- Distance safety score: 1 (Extreme Risk)
- Time Risk reason: The closing velocity suggests a collision is imminent if the current trajectories are maintained. Since it is so close to the vehicle, it will take less than a second to impact
- Time safety score: 1 (Extreme Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 1 (Extreme Risk)

**- Obstacle ID: 3045**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 3045 is behind the ego vehicle at a relatively safe distance (-15.89m longitudinally and -15.89m laterally).
- Distance safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- Time Risk reason: While the obstacle is moving towards the ego vehicle, the distance and relative velocity provide ample time to react.
- Time safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
