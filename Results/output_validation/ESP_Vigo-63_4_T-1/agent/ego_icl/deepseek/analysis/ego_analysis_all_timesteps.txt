### Analysis of Obstacle 3044 (Most Recent Timestep at 8.1 seconds):
- **Position**: Behind ego car (longitudinal -0.43 m, lateral 0.00 m)
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal 0.94 m/s (approaching), Lateral -0.00 m/s (stable)
- **Acceleration**: Longitudinal -0.09 m/s² (slightly decelerating), Lateral 0.04 m/s² (negligible)
- **Motion**: Driving toward ego car from behind with exact lateral alignment.

#### Trajectory Analysis (from 7.2s to 8.1s):
- Longitudinal distance decreases from -1.21 m to -0.43 m (closing at ~0.85 m/s average).
- Lateral distance remains 0.00 m (perfect alignment).
- Relative velocity is consistently positive (approaching) with minor fluctuations.

#### Risk Assessment:
1. **Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC)**:
   - Current longitudinal distance: 0.43 m (adjusted distance would be similar since lateral is 0.00 m).
   - MDC = 0.43 m → **Extreme Risk (1)** (0.43 m ≤ 0.5 m).

2. **Time-to-Collision (TTC)**:
   - TTC = Distance / Relative Velocity = 0.43 m / 0.94 m/s ≈ 0.46 s.
   - TTC ≈ 0.46 s → **Extreme Risk (1)** (TTC ≤ 0.5 s).

3. **Overall Risk**: 
   - Both MDC and TTC indicate Extreme Risk (1). 
   - Collision is imminent if trajectories continue.

### Analysis of Obstacle 3045 (Most Recent Timestep at 8.1 seconds):
- **Position**: Behind ego car (longitudinal -15.89 m, lateral 0.00 m)
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal 0.94 m/s (approaching), Lateral -0.06 m/s (negligible)
- **Acceleration**: Longitudinal -0.00 m/s² (constant speed), Lateral 0.00 m/s² (stable).
- **Motion**: Driving toward ego car from behind with exact lateral alignment.

#### Trajectory Analysis (from 7.2s to 8.1s):
- Longitudinal distance decreases from -16.61 m to -15.89 m (closing at ~0.8 m/s average).
- Lateral distance remains 0.00 m (perfect alignment).
- Relative velocity is positive but not rapidly increasing.

#### Risk Assessment:
1. **Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC)**:
   - Current longitudinal distance: 15.89 m → **No Risk (5)** (MDC > 5.0 m).

2. **Time-to-Collision (TTC)**:
   - TTC = 15.89 m / 0.94 m/s ≈ 16.9 s → **No Risk (5)** (TTC > 5.0 s).

3. **Overall Risk**: 
   - Both MDC and TTC indicate No Risk (5). 
   - No immediate threat.

### Notes:
- Obstacle 3044 is at **Extreme Risk (1)** due to very small MDC (0.43 m) and TTC (0.46 s). Collision is imminent if no action is taken.
- Obstacle 3045 poses no immediate risk (safe distance and TTC).
- No actual collision has occurred yet, but 3044 is the predicted collision obstacle if trajectories remain unchanged.
