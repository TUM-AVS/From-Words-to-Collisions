Obstacle 3044 Analysis:
- Trajectory: This obstacle has been consistently approaching the ego vehicle from behind, with the longitudinal distance decreasing from -1.21m to -0.43m over the past 0.9 seconds.  The lateral distance remains at 0.00m, indicating continued alignment in the same lane.
- TTC: TTC = Distance / Relative Velocity = -0.43m / 0.94 m/s ≈ -0.46s. The negative TTC suggests the obstacle might have just passed or is extremely close to the ego vehicle.
- MDC: Given the persistent decrease in longitudinal distance and lateral alignment, the MDC is approximately 0.43m.
- Risk:  The MDC of 0.43m and negative TTC indicate an *Extreme Risk (1)* of collision.

Obstacle 3045 Analysis:
- Trajectory: This obstacle is also approaching from behind, but at a greater distance. The longitudinal distance has decreased from -16.61m to -15.89m,  while the lateral distance remains at 0.00m. The closing velocity is relatively small.
- TTC: TTC = Distance / Relative Velocity = -15.89m / 0.94 m/s ≈ -16.90s. While the TTC is negative and large, it can't negate the potential risk of a collision because other vehicle could change lane.
- MDC: Since the obstacle is significantly behind and in the same lane, the MDC is considered to be > 5m for now.
- Risk: While approaching, the larger distance and relatively small closing velocity suggest a *Low Risk (4)* at this moment.

Overall Assessment:
Obstacle 3044 poses an Extreme Risk due to the very small MDC (0.43m) and negative TTC (-0.46s). Though Obstacle 3045 is approaching, it is not an immediate threat.
