At t=8.3s, Ego is at (416.45, -158.09) with velocity 6.96 m/s.

Obstacle 3044 is at (420.77, -160.07) with velocity 7.91 m/s.  The distance between Ego and Obstacle 3044 is approximately 4.7 meters. Given their current velocities and trajectories, a collision is possible within the next few timesteps if their paths continue unchanged and they maintain similar velocities. This represents a high risk, but not yet extreme, as there's still a small window for avoidance.

Obstacle 3045 is at (434.84, -166.50) with velocity 7.89 m/s.  The distance between Ego and Obstacle 3045 is approximately 19.05 meters, posing no immediate threat.

Given that Obstacle 3044 has a high risk of collision in the immediate future, but no actual collision is imminent, the overall scenario is not yet considered a collision scenario.
