At t=8.3s, Ego (3040.0) is at (416.45, -158.09) with velocity 6.96 m/s.

Obstacle 3044.0 is at (420.77, -160.07) with velocity 7.91 m/s. The distance is approximately 5.4 meters and closing, but the consistent lateral offset suggests parallel trajectories within the same lane.  Given the current velocities and accelerations, a collision is not imminent in the next few timesteps, but requires monitoring. Risk score: 2 (High Risk).

Obstacle 3045.0 is at (434.84, -166.49) with velocity 7.89 m/s. The larger longitudinal and lateral separation from Ego indicates a lower risk than Obstacle 3044.0. Risk score: 3 (Medium Risk).
