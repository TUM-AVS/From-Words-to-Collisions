### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 3044.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 3044.0 is in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle and, while slightly ahead, the distance has been decreasing over the past several timesteps. At the latest timestep, the obstacle is approximately 5.4 meters ahead. Given the speeds and the slight fluctuation in acceleration of both vehicles, a medium risk is assigned.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason:  While the obstacle is moving slightly faster than the ego vehicle, the relative velocity is small.  However, the fluctuating acceleration of obstacle 3044.0 makes predicting its future behavior challenging and adds to the time risk.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3

- Obstacle ID: 3045.0
- Distance Risk reason:  This obstacle is further ahead in the same lanelet and the distance between it and the ego vehicle has remained relatively stable but decreasing slightly throughout the provided timesteps. It poses a lower risk than 3044.0 due to the larger distance between it and the ego.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason:  The relative velocity between the ego vehicle and this obstacle is small. However, the fluctuating acceleration is noted. The time to collision is higher than obstacle 3044.0 at the latest timestep.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4


### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. **Most critical obstacle:** Obstacle 3044.0 presents the most immediate risk due to its proximity and decreasing distance to the ego vehicle.
2. **Trajectory analysis:** Over the 10 timesteps, obstacle 3044.0 has consistently been ahead of the ego vehicle in the same lanelet, but the distance has decreased.  The speed differential varies, so the situation needs further monitoring.
3. **Relative position, velocity, and acceleration:** The relative positions show a closing distance. Velocities show obstacle 3044.0 moving faster, although very marginally. The accelerations of both vehicles are inconsistent. These all need to be factored in the context of the relatively short observation period.  
4. **Collision determination:** No collision has occurred in the observed timeframe.  A collision is not imminent based on current data, but the trends suggest an increased risk going forward if this trend continues. 
5. **Reasoning:** While the current situation is not a collision, it cannot be ruled out as a collision scenario if the current trend continues. Constant monitoring is required.

  "CollisionObstacles": [],
  "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null,
  "ScenarioAnalysis": {
    "IsCollisionScenario": false,
    "Reasoning": "While obstacle 3044.0 is getting gradually closer to the ego vehicle and poses the highest risk, there is no collision in the observed timeframe. No obstacle shows an immediate collision risk (Risk Score 0 or 1) in the latest timestep, although close monitoring is required for obstacle 3044.0."
