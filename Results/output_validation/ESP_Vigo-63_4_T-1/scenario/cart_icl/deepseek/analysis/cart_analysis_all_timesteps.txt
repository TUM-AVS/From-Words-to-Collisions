### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep (8.3 seconds):

### Obstacle Analysis:
1. **Obstacle ID: 3041.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Moving in the same lanelet (223.0) as ego, but consistently ahead and maintaining distance (~35m longitudinal, ~19m lateral). Orientation aligns with ego.
   - **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: Velocity (8.15 m/s) slightly higher than ego (6.9567 m/s), but relative velocity is low (~1.2 m/s). Acceleration fluctuates but remains small.
   - **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low Risk)

2. **Obstacle ID: 3044.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Same lanelet (223.0), close to ego (~4.3m longitudinal, ~2.3m lateral). Orientation aligns with ego.
   - **Distance safety score**: 2 (High Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: Velocity (7.9132 m/s) higher than ego, but relative velocity (~0.96 m/s) suggests gradual approach. Acceleration is positive but small.
   - **Time safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 2 (High Risk)

3. **Obstacle ID: 3045.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Same lanelet (223.0), slightly ahead (~18.4m longitudinal, ~8.4m lateral). Orientation slightly diverges from ego.
   - **Distance safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: Velocity (7.8876 m/s) higher than ego, but relative velocity (~0.93 m/s) is low. Acceleration fluctuates but remains small.
   - **Time safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 3 (Medium Risk)

4. **Obstacle ID: 3046.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Different lanelet (127.0), moving away from ego (~53.2m longitudinal, ~37m lateral). Orientation diverges significantly.
   - **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: High velocity (9.9212 m/s) but moving away from ego. Acceleration is positive but irrelevant due to diverging paths.
   - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)

5. **Obstacle ID: 3047.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Different lanelet (2002.0), moving away from ego (~33.5m longitudinal, ~14m lateral). Orientation diverges.
   - **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: High velocity (8.9568 m/s) but moving away from ego. Acceleration is negative but irrelevant.
   - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. **Obstacle 3044.0** is the closest and poses the highest risk (High Risk, score 2) due to proximity and similar trajectory.
2. No obstacles are in immediate collision (score 0) or extreme risk (score 1).
3. Ego velocity is steady, and obstacles are either maintaining distance or diverging.
4. Historical data shows no sudden changes in trajectories or accelerations that would indicate imminent collision.
