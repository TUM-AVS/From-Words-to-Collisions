### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 3044
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 3044 is in the same lane and approaching the ego vehicle, but the distance is still significant over the past 10 time steps.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: The relative velocity between the ego vehicle and Obstacle 3044 is relatively small and hasn't shown a drastic change in the recent timesteps, suggesting a low immediate risk.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- Obstacle ID: 3045
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 3045 is further down the lane than Obstacle 3044 and maintains a safe distance from the ego vehicle.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: The relative velocity and acceleration suggest no immediate risk of collision.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5


### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
This is not a collision scenario. Both obstacles are in the same lane as the ego vehicle but maintain a safe distance, and their relative velocities and accelerations do not indicate an immediate collision risk.
