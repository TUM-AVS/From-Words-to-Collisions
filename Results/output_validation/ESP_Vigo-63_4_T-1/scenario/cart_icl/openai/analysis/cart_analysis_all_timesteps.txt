### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 3044**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is slightly ahead of the ego but within close proximity in the same lane due to its orientation and position. The trajectory shows a consistent path in the same lanelet, maintaining a small distance to the ego.
  - **Distance safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk due to moderate closeness)
  - **Time Risk reason**: Relatively higher velocity compared to the ego with minor fluctuations in acceleration, indicating it is moving slightly away over time but remains in close proximity.
  - **Time safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk due to manageable distance and velocity trend)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 3

- **Obstacle ID: 3045**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Obstacle positioning is further down the lane, beyond the immediate vicinity of the ego vehicle. It retains a consistent trajectory.
  - **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk due to greater distance)
  - **Time Risk reason**: Maintains a slightly higher velocity than the ego. Although accelerations have minor fluctuations, the overall trajectory hasn't posed any immediate risk throughout the analyzed period.
  - **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk due to manageable and consistent behavior)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 4

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. Both obstacles are within lanelet 223 and maintain consistent orientations and velocities relative to the ego vehicle.
2. Obstacle 3044, although close, does not converge towards the ego with any acceleration trends indicating an increased collision risk.
3. Obstacle 3045 maintains its distance further down the lane, posing even less direct collision threat.
4. No historical data suggests imminent collision due to steady velocity and minimal acceleration trends.
5. There is no indication of colliding paths within the assessed time.
