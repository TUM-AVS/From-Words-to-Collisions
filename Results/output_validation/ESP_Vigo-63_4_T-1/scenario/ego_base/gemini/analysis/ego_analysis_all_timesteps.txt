Obstacle 3044 is very close to the ego vehicle, with a longitudinal distance of only -0.24 meters at the most recent timestep (8.3 seconds).  It is approaching the ego vehicle with a relative velocity of 0.96 m/s. While the relative acceleration fluctuates, the overall trend suggests an impending collision if this motion continues.

Obstacle 3045, while further away at -15.71 meters, also presents a potential risk as it approaches with a relative velocity of 0.93 m/s. However, given the larger distance, it does not pose an immediate threat like obstacle 3044.


**Risk Levels and Definitions:**
<Collision (Score: 0)>: Actual collision has occurred or is unavoidable within the next timestep.
<Extreme Risk (Score: 1)>: Immediate collision or very high likelihood of impact. Urgent action is required.
<High Risk (Score: 2)>: Close to collision or highly probable collision path. Needs prompt attention and quick manoeuvring.
<Medium Risk (Score: 3)>: Moderate collision risk but manageable with timely reactions and proper strategies.
<Low Risk (Score: 4)>: Minimal collision risk. The situation is controllable with sufficient time to react.
<Negligible Risk (Score: 5)>: No significant collision risk. Obstacles are either moving away or far enough not to interfere.
