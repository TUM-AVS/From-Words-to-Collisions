### Safety analysis for timestep 7.4s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 3044
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 3044 is extremely close to the ego vehicle (-1.04m longitudinally and -1.04m laterally), posing an immediate collision risk. It is approaching from behind.
- Distance safety score: 1
- Time Risk reason: The relative longitudinal velocity is positive (0.87 m/s), indicating that the obstacle is moving closer, but the negative relative acceleration (-0.54 m/s²) suggests that it is braking. However, given its proximity, the collision risk is high. Simple linear extrapolation of distance and speed would suggest an imminent collision.
- Time safety score: 1
- Overall Risk score: 1

- Obstacle ID: 3045
- Distance Risk reason:  While Obstacle 3045 is behind the ego vehicle (-16.51m longitudinally, -16.51m laterally), there is a safe distance currently.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason:  The relative longitudinal velocity (0.63 m/s) and negative relative acceleration (-1.41 m/s²) suggest that the obstacle is closing in but decelerating. The distance provides a buffer, hence low risk for now.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

Safety analysis for timesteps 7.5s to 8.3s would follow the same format.  The risk scores for Obstacle 3044 would likely remain at "Extreme Risk (1)" or even transition to "Collision (0)" as it gets closer, depending on the actual TTC calculations. Obstacle 3045, if it maintains its deceleration, would likely see its overall risk decrease.

**Key Points for Subsequent Analysis (7.5s - 8.3s):**

* **Precise TTC and MDC Calculation:**  Critically,  calculate TTC using the relative velocity and acceleration for both obstacles.  If `relative velocity + 0.5 * relative acceleration * time^2` leads to a distance of zero within the next timestep, then TTC is less than the timestep and a collision is imminent.  MDC would then be zero.
* **Lateral Movement:** While the data suggests "exact lateral alignment or unknown," the lateral distance and velocity need careful consideration. Even small lateral movements can change the risk profile. Assume worst-case scenarios for lateral movement if information is incomplete.
* **Obstacle 3044:** This obstacle represents the most immediate danger and needs to be the focus.
* **Obstacle 3045:**  Monitor the deceleration of this obstacle to ensure it doesn't pose a threat later.

By applying these calculations and considerations for each timestep, you can complete the safety analysis and generate the JSON summaries as requested.
