### Obstacle-by-Obstacle Analysis

#### Obstacle 3044 (Most Recent Timestep: 8.3 seconds)
- **Position**: Behind ego car (longitudinal -0.24 m, lateral 0.00 m)
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal 0.96 m/s (approaching), Lateral -0.00 m/s (stable)
- **Motion**: Exact lateral alignment, driving toward ego car from behind.
- **Trajectory Analysis**:
  - Longitudinal distance decreases from -1.04 m at 7.4s to -0.24 m at 8.3s (0.8 m over 0.9s, consistent with ~0.89 m/s closing speed).
  - Lateral distance remains 0.00 m (exact alignment).
  - Relative velocity is stable (~0.9 m/s), indicating consistent approach.

- **TTC Calculation**:
  - Longitudinal TTC = 0.24 m / 0.96 m/s = **0.25 seconds** (Extreme Risk, TTC ≤ 0.5s).
  - Lateral TTC = N/A (no lateral movement).

- **MDC Calculation**:
  - Longitudinal MDC = 0.24 m (Extreme Risk, MDC ≤ 0.5m).
  - Lateral MDC = 0.00 m (Collision Risk if longitudinal distance also closes).

- **Risk Assessment**:
  - TTC and MDC both indicate **Extreme Risk (1)** due to very small distance and imminent collision.
  - Trajectory shows obstacle will reach ego vehicle in ~0.25s if velocities remain constant.

#### Obstacle 3045 (Most Recent Timestep: 8.3 seconds)
- **Position**: Behind ego car (longitudinal -15.71 m, lateral 0.00 m)
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal 0.93 m/s (approaching), Lateral -0.04 m/s (negligible)
- **Motion**: Exact lateral alignment, driving toward ego car from behind.
- **Trajectory Analysis**:
  - Longitudinal distance decreases slowly from -16.51 m at 7.4s to -15.71 m at 8.3s (0.8 m over 0.9s, ~0.89 m/s closing speed).
  - Lateral distance remains 0.00 m (exact alignment).
  - Relative velocity is stable (~0.9 m/s), indicating slow approach.

- **TTC Calculation**:
  - Longitudinal TTC = 15.71 m / 0.93 m/s = **16.89 seconds** (No Risk, TTC > 5.0s).
  - Lateral TTC = N/A (no lateral movement).

- **MDC Calculation**:
  - Longitudinal MDC = 15.71 m (No Risk, MDC > 5.0m).
  - Lateral MDC = 0.00 m (Collision Risk only if longitudinal distance closes significantly).

- **Risk Assessment**:
  - TTC and MDC indicate **No Risk (5)** due to large distance and slow approach.
  - No immediate threat.

### Collision Scenario Determination
- **Obstacle 3044**: Extreme Risk (1) due to TTC = 0.25s and MDC = 0.24m. Collision is imminent if no intervention occurs.
- **Obstacle 3045**: No Risk (5). Not a concern.

This is a **collision scenario** because Obstacle 3044 is in Extreme Risk (score 1) with TTC ≤ 0.5s and MDC < 0.5m, indicating an unavoidable collision if trajectories remain unchanged.
