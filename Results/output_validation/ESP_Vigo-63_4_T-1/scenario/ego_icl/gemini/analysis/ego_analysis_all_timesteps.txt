Obstacle 3044 Analysis:
- Trajectory: Obstacle 3044 has been consistently approaching the ego vehicle from behind, with the longitudinal distance decreasing from -1.04m to -0.24m over the observed time steps. Lateral distance remains at 0.00m, indicating it is directly behind and in the same lane.
- TTC (Longitudinal):  -0.24m / 0.96m/s = -0.25s (Note: negative TTC typically means obstacle has passed, but since the distance is small and approaching 0, it suggests imminent collision).
- MDC:  Approximately 0.24m (based on longitudinal distance).
- Risk Assessment:
    - MDC indicates Extreme Risk (1) due to proximity (< 0.5m).
    - Negative TTC with a small MDC indicates Extreme Risk (1).

Obstacle 3045 Analysis:
- Trajectory: Obstacle 3045 is also approaching the ego vehicle from behind, but from a much greater distance. Longitudinal distance is decreasing slightly (from -16.51m to -15.71m).  The lateral distance is consistently at 0.00m suggesting same lane alignment, but not yet a critical factor.
- TTC (Longitudinal): -15.71m / 0.93m/s = -16.89s. Again, the negative value is due to the negative longitudinal distance (behind ego) - but because the distance is substantial, this doesn't denote risk currently.
- MDC: Approximately 15.71m (based on longitudinal distance).
- Risk Assessment:  No Risk (5)

Collision Scenario Determination:
Yes, this is a collision scenario. Obstacle 3044 poses an Extreme Risk (1) with a very low MDC (0.24m) and a negative TTC, indicative of an imminent rear-end collision.
