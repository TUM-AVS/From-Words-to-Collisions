### Obstacle Analysis

#### Obstacle 3044

- **Most Recent Timestep (8.3 seconds):**
  - Adjusted Longitudinal Distance: -0.24 meters (Obstacle behind the ego vehicle)
  - Adjusted Lateral Distance: 0.00 meters (Exact lateral alignment)
  - Relative Longitudinal Velocity: 0.96 m/s (approaching)
  - Relative Lateral Velocity: 0.00 m/s
  - Motion: Obstacle is driving toward the ego car from behind.

- **Trajectory Analysis:**
  - Obstacle 3044 has been consistently closing the distance with the ego vehicle over the observed timesteps, moving from -1.04 meters at 7.4 seconds to -0.24 meters at 8.3 seconds.
  - Relative velocity shows consistent minor variability but remains around 0.94 to 0.96 m/s toward the ego vehicle.

- **Calculations:**
  - **TTC (Longitudinal):** Distance / |Relative Velocity| = 0.24 m / 0.96 m/s = 0.25 seconds (Extreme Risk)
  - **MDC (Longitudinal):** Adjusted distance is already near zero; projected trajectory is convergent.

- **Risk Assessment:**
  - **TTC and MDC indicate an Extreme Risk (1):** With the trajectory converging, an immediate collision is highly likely without intervention.

#### Obstacle 3045

- **Most Recent Timestep (8.3 seconds):**
  - Adjusted Longitudinal Distance: -15.71 meters
  - Adjusted Lateral Distance: 0.00 meters
  - Relative Longitudinal Velocity: 0.93 m/s (approaching)
  - Relative Lateral Velocity: -0.04 m/s
  - Motion: Obstacle is driving toward the ego car from behind.

- **Trajectory Analysis:**
  - Obstacle 3045 shows a slow but consistent approach toward the ego vehicle, with both distance and velocity mainly constant across timesteps.

- **Calculations:**
  - **TTC (Longitudinal):** Distance / |Relative Velocity| = 15.71 m / 0.93 m/s â‰ˆ 16.9 seconds
  - **MDC (Longitudinal):** 15.71 meters

- **Risk Assessment:**
  - **Low Risk (4):** Current high distance and TTC significantly reduce immediate collision concerns.

### Collision Scenario Determination

- **Obstacle 3044** is in an **Extreme Risk** situation with a longitudinal TTC much less than 0.5 seconds and a minimal distance rapidly converging.
  
- **Conclusion:** This is determined to be a collision scenario due to Obstacle 3044's extreme proximity and rapid approach, necessitating immediate intervention to prevent collision.
