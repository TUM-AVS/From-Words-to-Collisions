### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
    - Obstacle ID: 3044
    - Relative Direction: Behind
    - Distance Risk Reason: Obstacle 3044 is very close behind the ego vehicle, with DTClong = 0.24m.  The longitudinal distance has been decreasing over the past 10 timesteps, indicating a closing trajectory and increasing risk. Lateral distance is not a concern as the obstacle is directly behind.
    - Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 1
    - Lateral Distance Safety Score: 5
    - Overall Distance Safety Score: 1.0
    - Time Risk Reason:  TTClong is critically low at 0.26s, indicating a high probability of imminent collision if the current trajectories continue. TTClat is not relevant as the obstacle is directly behind. The decreasing trend in TTClong over the timesteps confirms the escalating risk.
    - Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 1
    - Lateral Time Safety Score: 5
    - Overall Time Safety Score: 1.0
    - Overall Risk Score: 1

    - Obstacle ID: 3045
    - Relative Direction: Behind
    - Distance Risk Reason: Obstacle 3045 is at a safe distance behind the ego vehicle, with DTClong = 15.71m. The longitudinal distance has been slightly decreasing over time, but remains far enough to be negligible risk currently.  Lateral distance is not a factor due to the directly behind relative direction.
    - Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 5
    - Lateral Distance Safety Score: 5
    - Overall Distance Safety Score: 5.0
    - Time Risk Reason: TTClong is 16.88s, indicating ample time to react. This along with the overall trajectory indicates a low risk of collision from this obstacle currently.  TTClat is not relevant as the obstacle is directly behind.
    - Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 5
    - Lateral Time Safety Score: 5
    - Overall Time Safety Score: 5.0
    - Overall Risk Score: 5


### Summary in JSON Format:  Summarize all obstacles with collision risk which Overall Risk Score is 0 and all obstacles with extreme risk which Overall Risk Score is 1 in the following JSON format. Make sure if they don't exist, set them as `null`:
```json
