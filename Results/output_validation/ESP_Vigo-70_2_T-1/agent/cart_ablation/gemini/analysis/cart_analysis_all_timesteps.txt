Analysis:

Obstacle 3393: This obstacle is in the same lane as the ego vehicle (lanelet 406).  Over the provided time steps, the y-position of this obstacle is decreasing, approaching the ego vehicle's y-position.  Additionally, obstacle 3393's velocity is consistently higher than the ego vehicle's velocity and its acceleration is fluctuating. This combination of closing distance and higher velocity represents a significant and increasing risk of collision.  The risk level is high and approaches extreme risk.

Obstacle 3394: This obstacle is in a different lane (lanelet 503) and the x-position difference suggests it is unlikely to collide with the ego vehicle. Although its velocity is higher than the ego vehicle's, the lateral separation suggests a low risk.

Obstacle 3395: This obstacle is also in a different lane (lanelet 2254) and the x-position indicates it is moving away from the ego vehicle. Therefore, the risk of collision with this obstacle is negligible.
