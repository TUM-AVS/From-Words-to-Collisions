Obstacle 3393 is in the same lane as the Ego vehicle and initially located ahead. Over the timesteps, its velocity is significantly higher than the Ego vehicle's, and it is accelerating more aggressively. While the absolute distance between them decreases, the y-coordinates suggest Obstacle 3393 might be pulling slightly ahead in the lane, which reduces the immediate collision risk somewhat.  However, given the continuous approach and the difference in acceleration, the situation needs close monitoring. I classify this as a high risk (2).

Obstacle 3394 is in a different lane (503) and does not pose a collision risk throughout the provided timesteps. Its trajectory keeps it separated from the Ego vehicle. Risk is negligible (5).

Obstacle 3395 is also in a different lane (2254) and its trajectory keeps it away from the Ego vehicle throughout the provided timesteps. Risk is negligible (5).
