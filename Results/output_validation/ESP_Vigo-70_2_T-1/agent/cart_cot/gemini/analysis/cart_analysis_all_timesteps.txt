Obstacle 3393 is showing concerning behavior.  While the distance between ego and obstacle 3393 is currently not extremely close, obstacle 3393's acceleration is increasing and its heading is changing to a similar value to the ego vehicle's.  This suggests a potential for the obstacle to cut into the ego vehicle's lane. Further monitoring is critical and evasive action may soon be required if this trend continues. The other obstacles do not present an immediate risk at this timestep.
