### Analysis:

#### Obstacle 3393.0
- **Trajectory & Relative Motion:** This obstacle is in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle (406.0). Over the analyzed period, its velocity increased significantly from 9.4417 to 11.2747 m/s, while the ego's velocity remained around 6.9663 m/s. This results in the obstacle closing the distance to the ego vehicle rapidly.
- **TTC (Time to Collision):** Considering the closing velocity (difference in velocities), the rapid increase in velocity, and the proximity, the TTC is reducing quickly.
- **MDC (Minimum Distance to Collision):** At 8.6 seconds, the positions are (-531.3424, 506.8559) for the ego vehicle and (-531.8545, 512.444) for the obstacle, indicating they are very close on the y-axis but slightly separated on the x-axis.
- **Overall Risk Score:** Given the rapid approach in the same lanelet without any notable divergence in path, there is an extreme risk of collision.

#### Obstacle 3394.0
- This obstacle is located in a different lanelet (503.0) and has consistently shown a safe distance across all time steps. Its path and velocity changes do not reflect immediate risk to the ego vehicle.

#### Obstacle 3395.0
- This obstacle is in lanelet 2254.0, consistently maintaining a safe distance from the ego vehicle with no significant trajectory shifts that endanger the ego vehicle's path.

### Conclusion:
- **Obstacle 3393.0** presents the highest risk due to its closing trajectory in the same lanelet. Based on the analysis, there is an extreme risk of collision without immediate intervention.
