At timestep 8.6s, Obstacle 3393 poses the most significant risk. It is in the same lanelet (406) as the ego vehicle and rapidly approaching from behind.  While the provided data doesn't directly give us longitudinal and lateral distances to calculate precise TTC, the decreasing Y-coordinate difference between the ego and Obstacle 3393, coupled with Obstacle 3393's much higher velocity and increasing acceleration, suggests a very high probability of a near-term collision if the trajectories remain unchanged.

Other obstacles (3394 and 3395) are in different lanelets and don't present immediate risks based on the available information.
