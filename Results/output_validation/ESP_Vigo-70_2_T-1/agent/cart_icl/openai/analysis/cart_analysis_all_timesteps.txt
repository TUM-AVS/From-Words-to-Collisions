To analyze the scenario provided, we'll evaluate the relative motion of each obstacle compared to the Ego vehicle over the most recent and previous timesteps, focusing on their positions, velocities, and lane associations. We will calculate the Time to Collision (TTC) and Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC) by assessing the obstacles' relative motion and predicted trajectories. Based on these calculations and relative distances, we will assign a risk level to each obstacle.

### Analysis:

1. **Ego Vehicle 3390.0**:
   - Consistently moving in lanelet 406.0 with small positive velocity and negligible acceleration.

2. **Obstacle 3393.0**:
   - Same lanelet (406.0) as the Ego vehicle throughout.
   - Positions trend: Getting closer to Ego, remains at a higher velocity and is accelerating.
   - Most recent relative position at 8.6s, ahead of Ego: Longitudinally about 5.6 meters.
   - Relative velocity: 11.2747 - 6.9663 = 4.3084 m/s towards Ego.
   - **TTC Calculation**: Longitudinal distance / Relative velocity = ~1.3 seconds.
   - Due to rapid closing in the same lane, this is a high collision risk scenario.

3. **Obstacle 3394.0**:
   - Different lanelet (503.0) and moving away from the Ego.
   - Not relevant for collision risk due to different lane and longitudinal increasing separation.

4. **Obstacle 3395.0**:
   - Different lanelet (2254.0) and moving away from the Ego.
   - Not relevant for collision risk due to different lane and longitudinal increasing separation.

### Risk Assessments:

- **Obstacle 3393.0**:
  - The obstacle is in the same lane as Ego and closing rapidly with a calculated TTC of ~1.3 seconds.
  - Assigned risk level **1: Extreme Risk (likely and imminent collision)**.

- **Obstacles 3394.0 and 3395.0**:
  - Moving in different lanelets and progressing away from the Ego vehicle.
  - Assigned risk level **4-5: Low or Negligible Risk** due to lane separation.
