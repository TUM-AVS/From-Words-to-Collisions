Obstacle 3393 is very close to the ego vehicle, with a longitudinal distance of -1.10 meters.  It is approaching rapidly at 4.31 m/s. Although the lateral velocity is near zero, the rapid approach from behind represents a very high risk of collision in the next few moments. This obstacle would be classified as an extreme risk.

Risk Levels:
0: Collision - Physical contact occurred or unavoidable
1: Extreme Risk - Immediate collision likely
2: High Risk - Close to collision, needs quick action
3: Medium Risk - Manageable with proper reaction
4: Low Risk - Minimal risk, sufficient time to react
5: Negligible Risk - No significant risk
