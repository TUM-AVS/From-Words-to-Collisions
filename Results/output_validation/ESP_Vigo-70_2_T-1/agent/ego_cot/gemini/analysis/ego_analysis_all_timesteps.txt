### Safety analysis for timestep 8.6s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

**Calculations and Assumptions:**

Since the provided context lacks vehicle dimensions to calculate adjusted distances (adjusted_d_long and adjusted_d_lat), I'll assume both ego and obstacle vehicles have a length of 4 meters and a width of 2 meters.  I will use these dimensions to estimate a safety margin for MDC calculations. I will also use the most recent timestep's velocity and acceleration to estimate TTC.  Note that without precise adjusted distances, these calculations represent approximations.

**Obstacle Analysis:**

- **Obstacle ID: 3393**
    - Distance Risk reason: At 8.6s, Obstacle 3393 is directly behind the ego vehicle at approximately 1.1m longitudinally and 1.1m laterally.  Considering vehicle dimensions, this is extremely close.
    - Distance safety score: 1 (Extreme Risk)
    - Time Risk reason:  The relative longitudinal velocity indicates Obstacle 3393 is approaching the ego vehicle rapidly.  The small longitudinal distance combined with a positive relative longitudinal velocity means a collision is imminent if the ego vehicle doesn't accelerate or the obstacle doesn't decelerate significantly. The low lateral distance and velocity suggest a lateral collision is also highly likely.
    - Time safety score: 1 (Extreme Risk)
    - Overall Risk score: 1 (Extreme Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 3394**
   - Distance Risk reason: Last seen at 8.0 seconds. At that time the obstacle was -25.05m longitudinally and -25.05m laterally. At that distance, the risk level would be evaluated as 5. The update at 8.6s indicates this obstacle does not pose a collision risk based on how far away it is.  The descriptions provided show it moving farther longitudinally so we can assign a risk score of 5.
    - Distance safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
    - Time Risk reason:  The relative motion and speed suggest that the obstacle is unlikely to collide with the ego vehicle even in the absence of any evasive action due to large longitudinal and lateral distances, thus risk level should be evaluated as 5.
    - Time safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
    - Overall Risk score: 5 (Negligible Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 3395**
    - Distance Risk reason: Last seen at 7.9 seconds. At that time, the obstacle was 20.99m longitudinally and -20.99m laterally. At that distance, the risk level would be evaluated as 5. Since then there have been no updates regarding this vehicle. However, the descriptions provided show it moving farther longitudinally and laterally so we can assign a risk score of 5.
    - Distance safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
    - Time Risk reason: Due to the substantial longitudinal and lateral separation, there seems to be no imminent risk of collision with this obstacle, hence the time risk score should be evaluated as 5.
    - Time safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
    - Overall Risk score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
