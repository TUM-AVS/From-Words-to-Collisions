Obstacle 3393 Analysis:
- Trajectory: This obstacle has been consistently behind the ego vehicle and approaching rapidly.  The longitudinal distance has decreased from -3.91m to -1.10m over the provided timesteps, while lateral distance remains 0.00m indicating it stays in the same lane.
- At 8.6 seconds:
    - Longitudinal distance: -1.10m
    - Longitudinal relative velocity: 4.31 m/s (approaching)
    - TTC (longitudinal): 1.10m / 4.31 m/s = 0.26 seconds
    - MDC: Approximately 1.10m (using longitudinal distance as it's directly behind). 
- Risk Assessment:
    - TTC indicates Extreme Risk (1)
    - MDC indicates High Risk (2)
    - Overall Risk: Extreme Risk (1) - prioritizing the higher risk (lower score).

Obstacle 3394 Analysis:
- Trajectory: This obstacle was initially rear-right and moving away longitudinally while approaching laterally. At 8.0 seconds, it is directly behind the ego vehicle and moves further away in following timestamps
- At 8.0 seconds:
    - Longitudinal distance: -25.05 m
    - Longitudinal relative velocity: -5.87 m/s (moving away)
    - Lateral Distance: 0.00m
    - Lateral relative velocity: 10.01 m/s (approaching)
    - TTC (longitudinal): N/A due to separating
    - TTC (lateral): 0.00m/ 10.01m/s = 0s
    - MDC: Approximately -25.05m

- Risk Assessment:
    - Although the lateral velocity is high, there is a diverging trajectory longitudinally.
    - Overall Risk: Negligible Risk (5)

Obstacle 3395 Analysis:
- Trajectory: Consistently rear-left and moving away from the ego vehicle both longitudinally and laterally.
- At 7.9 seconds:
    - Longitudinal distance: -20.99m
    - Longitudinal relative velocity: -11.16 m/s (moving away)
    - Lateral distance: 11.88m
    - Lateral relative velocity: 9.30 m/s (moving away)
- TTC (longitudinal and lateral): N/A - moving away in both directions
- MDC: Given the diverging trajectory, MDC is not relevant
- Risk Assessment:
    - Overall Risk: Negligible Risk (5)
