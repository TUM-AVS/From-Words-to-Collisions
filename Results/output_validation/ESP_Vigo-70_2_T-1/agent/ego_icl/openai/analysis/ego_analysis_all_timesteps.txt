Based on the information provided, let us analyze the most recent timestamp at 8.6 seconds to assess the risk associated with each obstacle:

### Obstacle-by-Obstacle Analysis

#### Obstacle 3393
- **Direction**: Behind the ego vehicle
- **Adjusted Position**: Longitudinal = -1.10 m, Lateral = 0.00 m (exact lateral alignment)
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal = 4.31 m/s toward ego, Lateral = 0.04 m/s
- **Motion Description**: Driving toward the ego car from behind, exact lateral alignment

**Trajectory & Calculations**:
- **Longitudinal position** is rapidly closing (-3.91 m to -1.10 m over the analyzed timeframe).
- **Longitudinal Velocity**: Closing because the velocity is positive, indicating approach.
- **TTC Longitudinal** = | -1.10 m / 4.31 m/s | = approx. 0.26 seconds
- **MDC**: Given exact lateral alignment and rapidly closing longitudinal gap, the MDC is effectively the longitudinal gap at this snapshot, which is 1.10 m.

**Risk Assessment**:
- **TTC** indicates Extreme Risk as 0.26 seconds falls below 0.5 seconds.
- **MDC** indicates High Risk because the closing distance points to an immediate need for action within 1 meter.
- **Final Risk Score**: Given the criteria, the highest risk is determined by the TTC result, leading to an **Extreme Risk** score (1).

#### Obstacle 3394
- **Direction**: Rear-right, now aligned behind at 8.0 seconds, but heading away longitudinally from the ego
- **Adjusted Position**: Longitudinal = -25.05 m, Lateral = 0.00 m (exact alignment laterally)
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal = -5.87 m/s (moving away longitudinally), Lateral = 10.01 m/s
- **Motion Description**: Moving away longitudinally

**Trajectory & Calculations**:
- **Longitudinal gap** is increasing as the relative velocity is negative (moving away).
- Since it's aligned laterally but moving away, the risk is considerably lower.
- **TTC** would be irrelevant here as the relative velocity indicates a separation.
- **MDC** > 5 meters, as there's no closing gap.

**Risk Assessment**:
- **Final Risk Score**: As there is no immediate risk and all calculated values indicate paths separating, it is a **Negligible Risk** (5).

#### Obstacle 3395
- **Direction**: Rear-left, still rear-left at prior timestamps, now absent in the latest timestamp indicating no immediate threat
- **Trajectory Analysis**: Over previous timesteps, it was moving away longitudinally and laterally.

**Risk Assessment**:
- With the information provided and its absence in the last timestep, it's not considered a risk in the immediate scenario.

### JSON Summary of Findings
```json
{
    "CollisionObstacle": {},
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "3393",
        "OverallRiskScore": "1"
    },
    "HighRiskObstacle": {}
}
```

This analysis indicates that Obstacle 3393 poses an **Extreme Risk** due to its rapid approach from behind, necessitating immediate attention to avoid collision.
