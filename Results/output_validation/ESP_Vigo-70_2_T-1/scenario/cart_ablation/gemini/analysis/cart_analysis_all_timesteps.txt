At t=8.8s, Ego is at (-531.2179, 505.4682) in lanelet 406. Obstacle 3393 is at (-531.6455, 510.1605), also in lanelet 406.  Obstacle 3394 is at an unknown position at this timestep, but was previously located in a different lanelet (503). Obstacle 3395 is also at an unknown position at this timestep and previously in lanelet 2254.

Focusing on Obstacle 3393, both its x and y coordinates are close to the Ego vehicle and it shares the same lanelet. Additionally, obstacle 3393 shows a pattern of increasing velocity and fluctuating, but generally positive acceleration values. The y-coordinate differences are decreasing over subsequent timestamps suggesting a closing distance between the vehicles and potential collision or extreme risk. Considering both position and dynamic states, Obstacle 3393 poses an Extreme Risk.
