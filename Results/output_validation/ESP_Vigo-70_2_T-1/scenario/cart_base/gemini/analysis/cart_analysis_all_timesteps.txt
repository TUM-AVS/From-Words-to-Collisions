Obstacle 3393 is in the same lane as the ego vehicle (lanelet 406) and its y-position is rapidly approaching the ego vehicle's. While the x-position difference suggests a slight lateral offset, the obstacle's significantly higher velocity (11.58 m/s vs. 6.97 m/s) and continued acceleration indicate a high probability of a rear-end collision within the next few seconds if the obstacle's behavior doesn't change.  The closing rate in the y-direction combined with the small x-difference and the obstacle's accelerating behavior pushes the risk assessment to Extreme (1).
