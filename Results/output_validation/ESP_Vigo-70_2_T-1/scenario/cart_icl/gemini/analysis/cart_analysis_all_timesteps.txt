### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 3393.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 3393.0 is in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle and rapidly approaching from behind.  The distance between them is decreasing over time, posing a significant risk.
- Distance safety score: 2
- Time Risk reason: The relative velocity and acceleration trends indicate a high probability of a near-term collision if no evasive action is taken.
- Time safety score: 2
- Overall Risk score: 2

- Obstacle ID: 3394.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 3394.0 is in a different lanelet and poses no immediate threat based on the current trajectories.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason:  The relative motion suggests no risk of collision in the near future.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5


### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
This is not a collision scenario at the most recent timestep. While Obstacle 3393.0 presents a high risk, it has not yet collided with the ego vehicle.  The situation requires immediate attention to avoid a collision.
