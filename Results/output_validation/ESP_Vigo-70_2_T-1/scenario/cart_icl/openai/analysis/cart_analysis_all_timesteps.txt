### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep at 8.8 seconds:

### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 3393.0**
  - **Distance Risk Reason**: The obstacle 3393.0 is in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle and is approaching from behind with significant travel distance over the previous timesteps. The distance between the ego and this obstacle has been decreasing consistently, indicating an increasing collision risk. Current relative position shows the obstacle very close, approximately 4.7 units apart longitudinally.
  - **Distance Safety Score**: 1 (Extreme Risk due to close proximity and same lane)
  - **Time Risk Reason**: The velocity of the obstacle is higher than the ego, with an increasing trend of speed and dynamic movement forward. Accelerating faster than the ego, reducing TTC to a concerning level.
  - **Time Safety Score**: 1 (Extreme Risk due to lack of sufficient time to prevent collision)
  - **Overall Risk Score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)

### Other Observations:
- **Obstacle ID: 3394.0** and **Obstacle ID: 3395.0** do not need a detailed breakdown for the most recent timestep as they have deviated lanes and pose no immediate risk considering their positions.

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
- **Step 1**: Evaluate proximity in the same lanelets. Obstacle 3393.0 consistently closing the gap with ego.
- **Step 2**: Review speed and acceleration patterns indicating reduced TTC for Obstacle 3393.0 as it continually gains on ego.
- **Conclusion**: Risk of collision is present for Obstacle 3393.0 due to proximity and trajectory within the same lanelet. TTC indicates urgent action required; therefore, an extreme risk of collision is established.
