Obstacle 3393 is extremely close to the ego vehicle at -0.20 meters longitudinally and 0.00 meters laterally. The relative longitudinal velocity indicates that the obstacle is approaching the ego vehicle at 4.61 m/s.  Given the minimal distance and the closing speed, a collision is imminent within the next timestep.

    "IsCollisionScenario": false,
    "Reasoning": "Obstacle 3393 poses an extreme risk with a very high likelihood of collision in the next timestep due to its proximity (-0.20m longitudinal, 0.00m lateral) and high closing velocity (4.61 m/s). While not a collision yet, it is highly probable to occur imminently."
