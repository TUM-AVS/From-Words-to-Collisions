Obstacle 3393 is very close to the ego vehicle at the most recent timestep (8.8 seconds), with a longitudinal distance of -0.20 meters.  The relative longitudinal velocity is 4.61 m/s, indicating it is approaching rapidly.  While the lateral velocity is minimal (0.01 m/s) and the lateral distance is 0, the closing longitudinal distance combined with the high relative velocity suggests an extremely high risk of collision in the next few moments.

        "Reasoning": "Obstacle 3393 poses an extreme risk with a very high probability of collision in the immediate future due to its proximity and high closing velocity relative to the ego vehicle.  While not yet a collision, it is highly likely to become one within the next timestep."
