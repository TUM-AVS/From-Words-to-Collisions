### Safety analysis for timestep 7.9s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 3393
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 3393 is very close behind the ego vehicle (-3.5m longitudinally and -3.5m laterally).  The negative longitudinal distance indicates it's behind the ego vehicle. Its motion suggests it's approaching. This poses a high risk.
- Distance safety score: 2
- Time Risk reason:  The relative longitudinal velocity is positive (2.29 m/s) while the distance is negative. This implies that the obstacle is closing the distance with the ego vehicle rapidly. Given the small distance, the TTC is very low increasing collision probability.
- Time safety score: 2
- Overall Risk score: 2

- Obstacle ID: 3394
- Distance Risk reason: While longitudinally distant (-24.47m), the lateral distance is also substantial (-24.47m) and the obstacle is moving towards the ego vehicle laterally, posing a medium risk.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason:  Longitudinally moving away (-6.65 m/s), reducing risk. However, the lateral relative velocity (9.94 m/s) and distance suggest a moderate TTC, requiring attention.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3

- Obstacle ID: 3395
- Distance Risk reason:  A safe longitudinal distance (-20.99m) and lateral distance (-20.99m). It's moving away both longitudinally and laterally.  
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Moving away in both directions (longitudinal -11.16 m/s, lateral 9.30 m/s) indicating no immediate time-related risk.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4


### Safety analysis for timestep 8.0s - 8.8s:
Obstacle 3393 continues to approach the ego vehicle from behind across these timesteps.  The longitudinal distance decreases steadily, while the lateral distance remains close. The relative longitudinal velocity increases, indicating that the approaching speed is getting faster. This consistently raises the risk of a collision.  Obstacle 3394 continues to move away longitudinally and there is no additional risk.


### Obstacle Analysis for 8.8s (example - other timesteps follow similar logic with escalating risk for 3393):
- Obstacle ID: 3393
- Distance Risk reason: Extremely close proximity behind the ego vehicle (-0.20m longitudinally and laterally). Imminent collision.
- Distance safety score: 1
- Time Risk reason: The relative velocity and close proximity point towards a very short TTC, almost certain collision unless immediate action is taken.
- Time safety score: 1
- Overall Risk score: 1

### Summary in JSON Format:

{
  "CollisionObstacle": null,
  "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {
    "ObstacleID": "3393",
    "OverallRiskScore": "1"
  },
  "IsCollisionScenario": false, 
  "Justification": "While a collision is not confirmed within the provided timeframe, Obstacle 3393 poses an extreme risk and is on a near-certain collision path with the ego vehicle if no evasive action is taken. The distance and relative velocity suggest imminent collision."
