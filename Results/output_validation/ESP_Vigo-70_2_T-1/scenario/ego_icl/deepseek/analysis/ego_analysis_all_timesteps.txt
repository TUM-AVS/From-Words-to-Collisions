### Obstacle-by-Obstacle Analysis (Most Recent Timestep: 8.8 seconds)

#### **Obstacle 3393** (Behind, Exact Lateral Alignment)
- **Adjusted Distance**: Longitudinal -0.20m (effectively 0.20m behind ego), Lateral 0.00m (aligned)
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal 4.61 m/s (approaching), Lateral 0.01 m/s (negligible)
- **Motion**: Driving toward ego from behind with exact lateral alignment.
  
**Risk Assessment**:
1. **Proximity**: 0.20m longitudinal distance is extremely close (MDC ≈ 0.20m → **Extreme Risk (1)**).
2. **TTC**: 
   - Longitudinal TTC = 0.20m / 4.61 m/s ≈ **0.043 seconds** (<< 0.5s → **Extreme Risk (1)**).
   - Lateral TTC: Not applicable (lateral velocity ≈ 0).
3. **Trajectory**: Over the last 1.0s, longitudinal distance decreased from -3.50m to -0.20m with increasing velocity (4.61 m/s at 8.8s). Collision is imminent.
4. **Overall Risk**: **0 (Collision)**. 
   - Justification: At 8.9s, the obstacle will reach ego’s rear (distance ≤ 0m). Even if ego brakes, the closing speed is too high to avoid collision.

#### **Obstacle 3394** (Behind, Exact Lateral Alignment)
- **Adjusted Distance**: Longitudinal -25.05m, Lateral 0.00m.
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal -5.87 m/s (moving away), Lateral 10.01 m/s (rapidly approaching laterally).
- **Motion**: Moving away longitudinally but driving toward ego laterally from the right.

**Risk Assessment**:
1. **Proximity**: Lateral distance is 0.00m (aligned), but longitudinal distance is large (25.05m).
2. **TTC**:
   - Longitudinal TTC: Not applicable (moving away).
   - Lateral TTC: 0.00m / 10.01 m/s = 0s → **Collision (0)** if lateral alignment persists.
3. **Trajectory**: Lateral velocity is extremely high (10.01 m/s), suggesting a potential sideswipe. However, longitudinal distance is increasing, so actual collision risk depends on timing.
4. **Overall Risk**: **1 (Extreme Risk)** due to lateral TTC = 0s. 

#### **Obstacle 3395** (Rear-Left)
- **Adjusted Distance**: Longitudinal -20.99m, Lateral 11.88m.
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal -11.16 m/s (moving away), Lateral 9.30 m/s (moving away).
- **Motion**: Moving away in both dimensions.

**Risk Assessment**:
1. **Proximity**: Large distances in both dimensions (MDC >> 5.0m → **No Risk (5)**).
2. **TTC**: Not applicable (diverging paths).
3. **Overall Risk**: **5 (No Risk)**.

### **Collision Scenario Determination**
- **Obstacle 3393**: 
  - **Collision occurring** (longitudinal distance ≈ 0.20m with closing speed 4.61 m/s; TTC ≈ 0.043s).
  - Even if ego brakes, collision is unavoidable due to proximity and velocity.
- **Obstacle 3394**: 
  - **Extreme Risk** (lateral TTC = 0s), but longitudinal divergence may prevent actual collision. Still critical to monitor.
