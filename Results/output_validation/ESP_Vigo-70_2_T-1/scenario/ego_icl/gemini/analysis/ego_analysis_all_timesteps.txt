At the most recent timestamp (8.8 seconds), Obstacle 3393 is behind the ego vehicle and rapidly approaching.  Let's analyze the trajectory and risk:

**Obstacle 3393 Trajectory Analysis:**

Across the provided timestamps, Obstacle 3393 consistently remains directly behind the ego vehicle (lateral distance = 0.00m). The longitudinal distance decreases from -3.50m at 7.9 seconds to -0.20m at 8.8 seconds, indicating rapid closing.  The longitudinal relative velocity is consistently positive and increasing, confirming the rapid approach.

**Obstacle 3393 Risk Assessment (8.8 seconds):**

* **Longitudinal Distance:** -0.20m
* **Lateral Distance:** 0.00m
* **Longitudinal Relative Velocity:** 4.61 m/s
* **Lateral Relative Velocity:** 0.01 m/s

* **TTC (Longitudinal):**  -0.20m / 4.61 m/s â‰ˆ -0.04 seconds. The negative TTC indicates the obstacle is predicted to have just passed based on its current velocity. This aligns with the extremely close longitudinal distance.

* **MDC:**  Since lateral alignment is reported as 0.00m, MDC is primarily determined by the longitudinal distance, which is extremely small (0.20m).

* **Risk Score:**  MDC is below 0.5m and the TTC is negative with a very low magnitude along with an increasing velocity, suggesting an imminent collision. The obstacle has already passed or is extremely close to the ego's rear bumper.  Given the rapid closure rate and alignment, this warrants an **Extreme Risk (1)** rating.

**Other Obstacles at 7.9 seconds:**

* **Obstacle 3394:** Located rear-right and moving away longitudinally while approaching laterally. Since it is moving away longitudinally (increasing distance), the risk of longitudinal collision is low.  
* **Obstacle 3395:** Located rear-left and moving away in both directions. This obstacle poses no immediate risk. 

**Other Obstacles - Later timesteps**

Obstacles 3394 and 3395 are not consistently observed in the later timesteps, possibly due to sensor limitations or them going out of view, and so no risk assessment is conducted.

**Collision Scenario Determination:**

Since Obstacle 3393 has an overall risk score of 1 (Extreme Risk) at the most recent timestep with near-zero distance and converging trajectories, this is classified as a **collision scenario**.


```json
{
  "CollisionObstacle": {},
  "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {
    "ObstacleID": "3393",
    "OverallRiskScore": "1"
  },
  "IsCollisionScenario": true,
  "Justification": "Obstacle 3393 poses an Extreme Risk (1) at the final timestamp with near-zero distance and high closing velocity toward ego's rear, thus constituting a collision scenario."
}
