### Obstacle-by-Obstacle Analysis at the Most Recent Timestep (8.8 seconds)

#### Obstacle 3393
- **Position**: Behind the ego car
- **Real Distances**: Longitudinal -0.20 m, Lateral 0.00 m
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal 4.61 m/s, Lateral 0.01 m/s
- **Motion Description**: Obstacle is driving toward the ego car from behind. Exact lateral alignment or unknown case.

**Trajectory Analysis**:
- The longitudinal distance between the ego vehicle and Obstacle 3393 is decreasing rapidly.
- From 7.9 seconds to 8.8 seconds, the longitudinal distance decreased from -3.5 m to -0.2 m, while the longitudinal velocity increased, indicating the obstacle is closing in quickly from behind.
- The lateral distance remains at 0.00 m, meaning both vehicles are aligned laterally, sharing the same lane.

**Calculations**:
- **TTC Calculation**:
  - Longitudinal TTC = Adjusted Longitudinal Distance / |Relative Longitudinal Velocity| = 0.20 / 4.61 â‰ˆ 0.043 s
  - Lateral TTC is not applicable due to no significant lateral movement impacting collision risk.
- **MDC**:
  - Closest longitudinal distance is 0.20 m.

**Risk Assessment**:
- **TTC**: 0.043 s indicates collision is imminent.
- **MDC**: 0.20 m is well within collision range.

**Risk Score**: 0 (Collision)

#### Obstacle 3394
- **Position**: Originally Rear-Right, moving Behind the ego vehicle
- **Current Timestep Adjusted Distances**: Longitudinal approximately -25.05 m, Lateral 0.00 m
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal -5.87 m/s, Lateral 10.01 m/s
- **Motion Description**: Obstacle is moving away longitudinally. Exact lateral alignment or unknown case.

**Trajectory Analysis**:
- The longitudinal distance is increasing, indicating the obstacle is moving away from behind.
- Initially moving from Rear-Right, now directly behind, indicating lateral closing motion but not significant enough to indicate imminent collision.

**Calculations**:
- **TTC Calculation**:
  - Longitudinal TTC = Adjusted Longitudinal Distance / |Relative Longitudinal Velocity| cannot be calculated as the obstacle is receding (negative velocity).
  - Lateral velocity indicates increased separation laterally.
- **MDC**:
  - Minimum distance far exceeds 5 meters.

**Risk Assessment**:
- Low risk due to diverging paths and large longitudinal distance.

**Risk Score**: 5 (No Risk)

### Conclusion
**Is this a Collision Scenario?**: Yes

**Justification**: Obstacle 3393 presents a collision scenario due to a very low longitudinal TTC (0.043 s) and a very small MDC (0.20 m) with converging trajectory.
