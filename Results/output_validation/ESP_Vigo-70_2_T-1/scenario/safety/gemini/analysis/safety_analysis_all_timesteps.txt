### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
    - Obstacle ID: 3393
    - Relative Direction: Behind
    - Distance Risk Reason: The obstacle is very close behind the ego vehicle, with DTClong = -0.20m. The obstacle has been consistently approaching the ego vehicle from behind over the past 10 timesteps. DTClat = 0.0m indicates perfect lateral alignment, further increasing the risk of a rear-end collision.
    - Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 1
    - Lateral Distance Safety Score: 5
    - Overall Distance Safety Score: 1.0
    - Time Risk Reason: TTClong = 0.04s, indicating an imminent collision. This aligns with the decreasing TTClong trend observed over the previous timesteps. TTClat = 0.0s is not relevant in this "Behind" scenario but reinforces the direct path of the obstacle towards the ego vehicle.
    - Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 1
    - Lateral Time Safety Score: 0
    - Overall Time Safety Score: 1.0
    - Overall Risk Score: 1
