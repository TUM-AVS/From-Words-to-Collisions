Here's the collision risk analysis:

**Obstacle 3391.0:** This obstacle is stationary and located at (-518.3852, 550.7047) throughout the provided timeframe. Given the Ego vehicle's trajectory and position, there is no indication of a collision risk with this obstacle.  Risk score: 5 (Negligible risk).

**Obstacle 3393.0:** This obstacle is moving and shows a varying acceleration and velocity. It maintains a safe lateral distance and has passed the Ego Vehicle, so there is no immediate risk of collision. Risk score: 4 (Low risk).

**Obstacle 3395.0:** This obstacle shows some concerning behavior. While initially moving with a positive acceleration, it exhibits erratic negative acceleration (-4.5) at 3.5s.  Its location appears to be behind the Ego Vehicle but in the same lane (503). This necessitates careful observation. Risk score: 3 (Medium risk). Its erratic deceleration requires observing its subsequent behavior for better risk assessment.
