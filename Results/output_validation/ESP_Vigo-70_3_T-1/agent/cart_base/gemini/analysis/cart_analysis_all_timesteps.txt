Obstacle 3391.0: This obstacle is stationary and relatively far from the ego vehicle's trajectory.  The y-coordinate difference remains fairly constant around 12-13 units, while the x-coordinate difference is larger, increasing from around 10 to 10 units over the provided timesteps. Given the ego vehicle's trajectory and decreasing velocity, a collision is unlikely.  Risk score: 5 (Negligible Risk)

Obstacle 3393.0: This obstacle is moving relatively fast and its x-coordinate is approaching the ego vehicle's. While the initial distance is significant, the closing rate warrants observation. However, the y-coordinate difference between the vehicles suggests diverging paths, minimizing collision risk. As the ego vehicle decelerates and Obstacle 3393 moves primarily along the x-axis, the risk diminishes over the given time period.  Risk score: 4 (Low Risk initially, transitioning to 5 - Negligible Risk).

Obstacle 3395.0:  This obstacle's position is initially very close to the ego vehicle.  While its y-coordinate stays relatively constant and close to the ego's, the x-coordinate difference fluctuates but remains small (around 9-10 units) initially then slowly increases toward the end of the time period. Combined with the vehicles' respective velocities and decelerations, this suggests a moderate risk of collision that decreases toward the end of the period. Risk score: 3 (Medium Risk initially, transitioning to 4).
