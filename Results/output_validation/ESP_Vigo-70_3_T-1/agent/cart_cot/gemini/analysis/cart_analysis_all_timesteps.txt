Obstacle 3391 is stationary and distant from the ego vehicle, posing no immediate risk. Obstacles 3393 and 3395 are moving and require further analysis.

In the most recent timestep (3.8 seconds), obstacle 3393 is at (-547.886, 534.2634) and the ego vehicle is at (-527.9988, 537.4316).  Obstacle 3393 has a velocity of 7.5802 and is moving somewhat laterally relative to the ego vehicle (y-coordinate is increasing at a slower rate than the ego vehicle's). Given the current trajectories and velocities, a moderate risk assessment is appropriate.

Obstacle 3395, at (-533.2915, 539.6039), is closer to the ego vehicle than 3393, but their y-coordinates are very close.  Obstacle 3395 has a velocity of 6.0637. Although the x-coordinate difference suggests 3395 is moving closer to the ego, the similar y-coordinates and the current heading of the ego and obstacle 3395 suggest that the vehicles are roughly on parallel paths that won't intersect in the near future.  The risk from obstacle 3395 is medium as well.
