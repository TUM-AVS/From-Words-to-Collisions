In the provided scenario, we are analyzing the risk levels of various obstacles relative to the ego vehicle using their position, orientation, and velocity at time 3.8 seconds. Hereâ€™s the assessment of the obstacles:

1. **Obstacle 3391**: 
   - This obstacle is stationary at (-518.3852, 550.7047). Since it is not moving, the ego vehicle has the flexibility to adjust its path appropriately to maintain a safe distance. The risk remains low as it is stationary, and its position isn't within immediate collision path.
   - **Overall Risk Score**: 5 

2. **Obstacle 3393**: 
   - At position (-547.886, 534.2634) with velocity 7.5802 meters/second. Its trajectory indicates a substantial speed, but it is not on a collision course with the ego vehicle which is moving slowly and in a direction generally clear of this obstacle's path.
   - **Overall Risk Score**: 4

3. **Obstacle 3395**: 
   - Positioned at (-533.2915, 539.6039) with a velocity of 6.0637 meters/second. Despite being the closest dynamically, its trajectory isn't directly headed towards the Ego.
   - However, due to its proximity and the ego vehicle's slowing speed, continuous monitoring is necessary, hence it presents a medium risk.
   - **Overall Risk Score**: 3

Based on the analysis, none of the obstacles have an extreme or high-risk score that would trigger a score of 0 or 1. Therefore, these scenarios list as lower risk levels.

Here's the structured JSON format, ensuring proper syntax:

```json
{
    "CollisionObstacles": [],
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null,
    "HighRiskObstacle": null
}
```

No formatting issues are present in the JSON, and all objects are marked with appropriate scores based on the current risk evaluation strategy.
