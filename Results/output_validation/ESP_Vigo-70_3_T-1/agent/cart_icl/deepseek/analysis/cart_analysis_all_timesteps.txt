### Analysis:

1. **Obstacle 3391.0**:  
   - **Position**: Stationary at (-518.3852, 550.7047)  
   - **Distance to Ego**: ~13.5m (calculated using Euclidean distance)  
   - **Relative Motion**: Ego is moving away from the obstacle (no convergence in trajectories).  
   - **Risk**: Negligible (5)  

2. **Obstacle 3393.0**:  
   - **Position**: Moving from (-553.362, 529.785) to (-547.886, 534.2634)  
   - **Relative Motion**: Moving diagonally away from the ego vehicle.  
   - **Distance to Ego**: Increasing (~25m to ~20m over timesteps).  
   - **Risk**: Low (4)  

3. **Obstacle 3395.0**:  
   - **Position**: Moving from (-538.5016, 540.1235) to (-533.2915, 539.6039)  
   - **Relative Motion**: Approaching the ego vehicle but with a lateral offset.  
   - **Distance to Ego**: Decreasing (~10m to ~5m over timesteps).  
   - **TTC**: ~5s (assuming constant velocity).  
   - **Risk**: Medium (3)  

### Highest Risks:
- No collision (0) or extreme risk (1) obstacles detected.  
- Obstacle 3395.0 poses the highest risk but is manageable (Medium Risk).
