### Analysis

#### Obstacle 3391.0:
- **Position:** (-518.3852, 550.7047)
- **Velocity:** 0.0 (stationary)
- **Trajectory:** Not moving, no change in position.
- **Risk Level:** 5 - Negligible Risk as there's no motion.

#### Obstacle 3393.0:
- **Position at 3.8s:** (-547.886, 534.2634), with velocity decreasing to 7.5802 m/s.
- **Trend:** Steady path with slight deceleration. 
- **Relative position to Ego:** The distance is increasing laterally and longitudinally from the ego vehicle.
- **Risk Level:** 4 - Low Risk. No immediate danger due to consistent separation.

#### Obstacle 3395.0:
- **Position at 3.8s:** (-533.2915, 539.6039) moving with velocity 6.0637 m/s.
- **Trend:** Increasing velocity but trajectory remains separate from Ego.
- **Relative position to Ego:** Lateral and longitudinal distance is maintained.
- **Risk Level:** 4 - Low Risk as trajectories do not converge based on current data.

In this scenario, no obstacles present immediate or severe risk to the ego vehicle. The stationary nature of obstacle 3391.0 and the trajectories of obstacles 3393.0 and 3395.0 suggest that the risk levels remain low and separate from the path of the Ego.
