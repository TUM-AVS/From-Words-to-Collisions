Obstacle 3391: This obstacle is to the left of the ego vehicle, with a significant lateral distance of 14.76 meters.  Longitudinal velocity and acceleration suggest it might be slightly moving towards the ego vehicle but poses no immediate risk.  Overall risk score: 5 (Negligible Risk).

Obstacle 3393: This obstacle is behind and to the right of the ego vehicle.  The real distance is decreasing and it is approaching the ego vehicle both longitudinally and laterally. However, the distances are still relatively large (9.14m longitudinally and 13.20m laterally). Taking the motion into account, combined with the distances, the overall risk score is 4 (Low Risk).

Obstacle 3395: This obstacle is directly behind the ego vehicle and very close longitudinally (0.99 meters). The relative longitudinal velocity is high (4.68 m/s), indicating a rapidly closing distance. This represents a very dangerous situation. Considering the minimal distance, high closing speed, and the fact that there is almost no lateral displacement, the risk score is 1 (Extreme Risk).
