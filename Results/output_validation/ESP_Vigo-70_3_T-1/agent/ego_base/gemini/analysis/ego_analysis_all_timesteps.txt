Obstacle 3391: This obstacle is to the left of the ego vehicle and maintains a parallel trajectory.  The lateral distance is substantial (14.76 m), and there is no lateral relative motion.  This obstacle poses no immediate risk. Risk score: 5

Obstacle 3393: This obstacle is approaching the ego vehicle from the rear-right. While it is closing the distance, it is still relatively far (9.14m longitudinally and 13.20m laterally).  The relative velocities suggest it might be changing lanes, but it's not an immediate threat. Risk score: 3

Obstacle 3395: This obstacle is directly behind the ego vehicle and rapidly closing in (longitudinal distance 0.99 m).  Its high longitudinal relative velocity (4.68 m/s) and the short distance make a collision very likely in the next second or two if the ego vehicle doesn't react. Risk score: 1


Risk Levels:
0: Collision - Physical contact occurred or unavoidable
1: Extreme Risk - Immediate collision likely
2: High Risk - Close to collision, needs quick action
3: Medium Risk - Manageable with proper reaction
4: Low Risk - Minimal risk, sufficient time to react
5: Negligible Risk - No significant risk
