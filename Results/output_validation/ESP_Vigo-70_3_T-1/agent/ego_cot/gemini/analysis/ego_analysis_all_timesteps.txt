### Safety analysis for timestep 3.8 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

**Calculations and Assumptions:**

* **Adjusted Distance:**  Since no vehicle sizes are provided, I'm assuming the provided longitudinal and lateral distances are already adjusted for vehicle size.  If this is not the case, the analysis may be inaccurate.
* **TTC Calculation:** I'm assuming a simplified TTC calculation using distance/relative velocity. More sophisticated calculations might consider acceleration as well. However, given that information, a simplified calculation is applied here.
* **Collision Prediction:** Based on proximity and direction, the risk scores will be determined.

### Obstacle Analysis:

**- Obstacle ID: 3391**
- Distance Risk reason:  Longitudinal and lateral distances are both 0.00m, indicating a collision.  
- Distance safety score: 0
- Time Risk reason:  Collision is imminent given 0 distance.
- Time safety score: 0
- Overall Risk score: 0

**- Obstacle ID: 3393**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is at longitudinal -9.14 m and lateral -9.14 m (Rear-right).  While a safe distance currently, the obstacle is moving towards the ego vehicle both longitudinally and laterally.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Need relative velocities and accurate distances to calculate TTC, but the movement suggests a potential future risk that isn't imminent.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

**- Obstacle ID: 3395**
- Distance Risk reason:  Obstacle is at longitudinal -0.99 m and lateral -0.99 m (Behind).  This is extremely close.
- Distance safety score: 1
- Time Risk reason: Given the close proximity and the movement of this obstacle towards the ego vehicle, a collision is likely imminent.
- Time safety score: 1
- Overall Risk score: 1
