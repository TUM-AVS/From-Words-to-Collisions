At t=4.0s, Ego is at (-527.856, 537.3188) with a velocity of 0.8177 m/s.

Obstacle 3391 is stationary at (-518.3852, 550.7047).  The distance between Ego and Obstacle 3391 is approximately 14.4 meters. Given the trajectories and lanelets (different lanelets imply they are likely on different roads or separated by a median/barrier), there is no immediate risk. Risk score: 5.

Obstacle 3393 is at (-546.7188, 535.2246) with a velocity of 7.6066 m/s.  This obstacle is moving towards the Ego's general vicinity, and merits further examination.  Calculating distance shows approximately 19 meters separation. Additionally, they are in different lanelets, suggesting different road sections, thus reducing the immediate collision risk. Risk score: 3.

Obstacle 3395 is at (-532.1027, 539.2331) with a velocity of 6.4143 m/s.  The distance to Ego is about 4.7 meters. The proximity and closing velocity pose a high risk, as any sudden maneuver or change in acceleration from either vehicle could lead to a collision within the next few seconds. Risk score: 2.

  "ScenarioAnalysis": {
    "IsCollisionScenario": false,
    "Reasoning": "No obstacle presents an immediate collision risk at t=4.0s. Obstacle 3395 poses the highest risk (Risk Score 2) due to its proximity and velocity relative to Ego, warranting close monitoring. Other obstacles are further away and/or in different lanelets, indicating lower risk."
