At t=4.0s, Ego is at (-527.856, 537.3188) and decelerating.

Obstacle 3391.0 is stationary at (-518.3852, 550.7047).  The y-coordinate difference is significant (~13.4), and Ego is moving essentially parallel to the x-axis, so collision risk with this obstacle is negligible.

Obstacle 3393.0 is at (-546.7188, 535.2246) and accelerating. The x and y differences between Ego and this obstacle are around -18.9 and 2.1 respectively. Given the trajectories, this obstacle represents a low risk, as it's moving away from the Ego vehicle in the y direction although the x coordinates are converging.

Obstacle 3395.0 is at (-532.1027, 539.2331) and accelerating.  The x and y differences between Ego and this obstacle are around -4.2 and 1.9 respectively. Given that both are moving in roughly the same direction (along the x-axis), and the differences in both x and y are relatively small and the x-coordinates are converging, there is a higher risk of collision.  Based on the previous time steps, the rate of convergence in the x-coordinate seems concerning, though it's not an immediate collision (within the next second).  Classifying this as a High Risk (2).
