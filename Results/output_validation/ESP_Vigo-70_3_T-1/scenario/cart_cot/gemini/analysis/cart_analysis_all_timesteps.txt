### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 3391.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 3391.0 is stationary and located in a different lanelet (409.0) than the ego vehicle (2254.0). Its Y-coordinate is consistently around 13 units greater than the ego vehicle's, indicating a significant lateral separation. The historical data reinforces its static nature and lack of risk.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: The obstacle is stationary, posing no immediate time-related risk.  The historical data consistently shows zero velocity and acceleration.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 3393.0
- Distance Risk reason:  Obstacle 3393.0 is in lanelet 503.0 and though it started further away from the ego vehicle, it has been approaching over the past 10 timesteps. The X-coordinate difference has decreased significantly, indicating a closing distance.  At the most recent timestamp the x coordinate shows a difference of ~19 units while the y coordinate shows a difference of ~3 units, still suggesting separation at the current moment, though closing rapidly.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: This obstacle has a high velocity (around 7.6 m/s) and is moving towards the ego vehicleâ€™s X coordinate.  While its acceleration fluctuates, the overall trend indicates this obstacle may pose a high risk in the near future.
- Time safety score: 2
- Overall Risk score: 2

- Obstacle ID: 3395.0
- Distance Risk reason:  Obstacle 3395.0 is in the same lanelet (503.0) as obstacle 3393.0 but closer to the ego vehicle in terms of X-coordinate. It started much closer to the ego vehicle than 3393.0 and it appears that if the ego vehicle maintains current speed/acceleration it may be a lower risk than 3393.0 given the observed behavior of obstacle 3395.0. However, the difference in x position is less than 6 units at the final timestep and the y position is less than 2 units suggesting the current situation is medium risk, and monitoring is still required.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: Obstacle 3395.0's velocity and acceleration have fluctuated considerably throughout the provided timesteps.  It appears that the ego vehicle may be braking, which would lessen the chances of immediate collision in the short term. However, there is a risk in the near future if any sudden velocity changes happen or acceleration resumes in a way that closes the distance at a higher rate.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. **Most critical obstacles:** Obstacles 3393.0 and 3395.0 are the most critical due to their proximity to the ego vehicle and their location in a lane that could cause a collision. Obstacle 3391.0 is stationary and in a different lanelet, posing no immediate threat.

2. **Trajectory analysis:** Over the 10 timesteps, obstacle 3393.0 has consistently moved towards the ego vehicle with a relatively high velocity. Obstacle 3395.0 initially shows an increase in velocity but reduces significantly.

3. **Relative positions, velocities, and accelerations:** Both 3393.0 and 3395.0 are relatively close to the ego vehicle at the final timestep. 3393.0 has a much higher velocity compared to the decelerating ego vehicle, increasing the risk of collision. 3395.0 is closer to the ego vehicle at the final time step but presents a lesser velocity.

4. **Collision determination:**  No collision has occurred yet. However, given the relative velocities and positions, a collision with obstacle 3393.0 is highly possible in the near future if the current trajectories continue.  Obstacle 3395.0 also shows a high probability of collision given it is much closer at the final timestep.

5. **Reasoning:** The continuous decrease in distance between the ego vehicle and obstacle 3393.0, coupled with the high velocity of 3393.0, suggest a high risk of a collision. Although 3395.0 velocity decreases significantly over the last few timesteps it is much closer to the ego vehicle. The continuous deceleration of the ego vehicle does somewhat mitigate the collision, it is not enough to deem the scenario safe. This is further compounded by the uncertainty introduced by fluctuating accelerations.

### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
  "CollisionObstacles": null,
  "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {
    "ObstacleID": "3393.0",
    "OverallRiskScore": 2
  },
  "ScenarioAnalysis": {
    "IsCollisionScenario": false,
    "Reasoning": "While no collision has occurred yet, obstacle 3393.0 poses a high risk due to its proximity, high velocity, and closing distance to the ego vehicle. Obstacle 3395.0 also poses risk of collision because despite slower speeds its very close to the ego vehicle.  The ego vehicle's deceleration reduces the immediacy of the risk, but the potential for collision is still present in the near future, so it remains a high-risk scenario."
