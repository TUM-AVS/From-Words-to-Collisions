### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 3391.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is located in a different lanelet and far from the ego vehicle.  History shows no indication of potential intersection paths.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Stationary obstacle poses no immediate time-based risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 3393.0
- Distance Risk reason: Although in a different lanelet, the obstacle's trajectory over the past few timesteps suggests it is moving somewhat closer to the ego vehicle's lanelet, requiring monitoring.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: The obstacle's velocity is higher than the ego vehicle's, but the acceleration is fluctuating and currently decreasing slightly, indicating slightly reduced risk.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- Obstacle ID: 3395.0
- Distance Risk reason: This obstacle is in the same lanelet as obstacle 3393 and also shows a trend of moving slightly closer to the ego vehicle's lanelet over time, warranting attention.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Although exhibiting fluctuations in acceleration, the obstacle's overall velocity history suggests it maintains a speed significantly higher than the ego vehicle.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4


### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
This is not a collision scenario. No obstacles are on a direct collision course with the ego vehicle in the immediate future. While obstacles 3393.0 and 3395.0 are moving somewhat closer to the ego vehicle's lanelet, they are still a safe distance away and present a low risk at the current time. Continued monitoring is advised.


### Summary in JSON Format:
