### Obstacle Analysis for the Most Recent Timestep (4.0 seconds):

1. **Obstacle ID: 3391.0**
   - **Distance Risk Reason**: Stationary, located in lanelet 409.0, far enough not to interfere with Ego in lanelet 2254.0.
   - **Distance Safety Score**: 5
   - **Time Risk Reason**: Stationary for all timesteps, no immediate collision threat.
   - **Time Safety Score**: 5
   - **Overall Risk Score**: 5

2. **Obstacle ID: 3393.0**
   - **Distance Risk Reason**: High relative velocity compared to Ego, located in lanelet 503.0, on a different trajectory than Ego. Position incrementally moving away.
   - **Distance Safety Score**: 4
   - **Time Risk Reason**: Consistent velocity decreasing slightly with no drastic changes. Not on collision course given lanelet difference.
   - **Time Safety Score**: 4
   - **Overall Risk Score**: 4

3. **Obstacle ID: 3395.0**
   - **Distance Risk Reason**: Located in lanelet 503.0, moving slightly toward Ego's current trajectory but at a safe distance. 
   - **Distance Safety Score**: 3
   - **Time Risk Reason**: Moderate velocity and acceleration, potentially moving closer to Ego in future if the trajectory remains unchanged.
   - **Time Safety Score**: 3
   - **Overall Risk Score**: 3

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:

- **At the latest timestep, none of the obstacles are in the same lanelet as the Ego vehicle.**
- **Obstacle 3391.0** is stationary, consistently in a non-colliding position.
- **Obstacle 3393.0** maintains lateral movement and sufficient distance from Ego's forward path.
- **Obstacle 3395.0** shows a pattern of movement that may gradually bring it closer, but current separation prevents immediate risk.
- **TTC and MDC calculations** neither show imminent collision scenarios nor breach medium risk thresholds.
