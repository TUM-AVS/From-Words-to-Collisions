Obstacle 3395 is very close to the ego vehicle, with a longitudinal distance of -0.01m, meaning it's almost directly behind the ego vehicle.  The lateral distance is 0.00 m, indicating perfect lateral alignment.  The relative longitudinal velocity of 5.20 m/s suggests 3395 is approaching the ego vehicle rapidly from behind. Although the overall motion suggests a potential collision, the context lacks information about the obstacles' and ego's sizes and shapes. Therefore, it is impossible to determine with certainty if an actual collision will occur. However, the proximity and relative velocity present an extreme risk.

**Risk Levels and Definitions:**
<Collision (Score: 0)>: Actual collision has occurred or is unavoidable within the next timestep.
<Extreme Risk (Score: 1)>: Immediate collision or very high likelihood of impact. Urgent action is required.
<High Risk (Score: 2)>: Close to collision or highly probable collision path. Needs prompt attention and quick manoeuvring.
<Medium Risk (Score: 3)>: Moderate collision risk but manageable with timely reactions and proper strategies.
<Low Risk (Score: 4)>: Minimal collision risk. The situation is controllable with sufficient time to react.
<Negligible Risk (Score: 5)>: No significant collision risk. Obstacles are either moving away or far enough not to interfere.
