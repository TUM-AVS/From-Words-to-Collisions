### Safety analysis for timestep 3.1s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 3391
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 3391 has 0 longitudinal and lateral distance indicating a collision with the ego vehicle from Left.
- Distance safety score: 0
- Time Risk reason:  Since the distance is 0, TTC calculation is not applicable although relative longitudinal velocity is negative, implying the obstacle might move away shortly.
- Time safety score: 0
- Overall Risk score: 0

- Obstacle ID: 3393
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 3393 is at a safe distance behind and to the right of the ego vehicle, posing no immediate risk, but getting closer.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Based on current velocities and relative motion, a collision is unlikely in the near future but requires continuous monitoring since it is approaching.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- Obstacle ID: 3395
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 3395 is relatively close behind and to the right of the ego vehicle, posing a moderate risk as it is approaching.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: With its current speed and trajectory, obstacle 3395 poses a high risk of collision in the near future since it's rapidly approaching the ego vehicle.
- Time safety score: 2
- Overall Risk score: 2


### Safety analysis for timestep 3.2s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 3391
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 3391 maintains 0 distance, indicating a continuous collision state with the ego vehicle.
- Distance safety score: 0
- Time Risk reason: Although there is a negative longitudinal relative velocity, the continuous 0 distance suggests the obstacle might be stationary or stuck to the ego vehicle from Left.
- Time safety score: 0
- Overall Risk score: 0

- Obstacle ID: 3393
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 3393 remains at a safe distance but its continuous approach necessitates close monitoring.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: The risk of collision remains low for now, but due to its movement towards the ego vehicle, constant observation is needed since it is approaching.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- Obstacle ID: 3395
- Distance Risk reason: The decreasing distance of Obstacle 3395 poses an increasing risk as it's moving closer to the ego vehicle from Rear-right.
- Distance safety score: 2
- Time Risk reason: Obstacle 3395's speed and trajectory present a high risk of collision shortly.
- Time safety score: 2
- Overall Risk score: 2



### Safety analysis for timestep 3.3s through 4.0s:
Obstacle 3391 continues to maintain zero distance, indicating an ongoing collision, most likely alongside the ego vehicle since it is on the left, resulting in risk scores of 0 for distance and time, thus an overall risk score of 0.

Obstacle 3393 generally maintains a safe distance, but its continued approach requires monitoring.  Risk scores fluctuate between 3 and 4 for both distance and time, indicating a low to medium overall risk level.  A precise risk score for each time step would require more detailed calculations based on the provided data.

Obstacle 3395 poses an increasing risk throughout the timeframe.  Initially a high risk (Overall Score 2), its decreasing distance and closing velocity escalate to an extreme risk and likely a collision at or just before 4.0 seconds (Overall Score 1 or 0). The information suggests it approaches from behind and to the right.
