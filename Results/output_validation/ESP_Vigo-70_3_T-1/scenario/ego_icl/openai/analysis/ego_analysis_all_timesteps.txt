Let's assess each obstacle at the most recent timestep (4.0 seconds) using the adjusted distances.

### 1. Obstacle 3391
- **Direction**: Left
- **Adjusted Distances**: Longitudinal 0.00 m, Lateral 14.76 m
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal -0.82 m/s, Lateral -0.00 m/s
- **Trajectory and Motion Description**: Exact longitudinal alignment, no lateral relative motion.

#### Analysis:
This obstacle is consistently at a significant lateral distance from the ego vehicle. There is no lateral velocity, indicating no movement towards our vehicle laterally. The longitudinal relative velocity is negative, suggesting it moves away in the longitudinal direction.

- **TTC**: Not applicable (not approaching laterally or longitudinally).
- **MDC**: > 5.0 meters

#### Risk Assessment:
- **Risk Score**: 5 (No Risk)

### 2. Obstacle 3393
- **Direction**: Rear-right
- **Adjusted Distances**: Longitudinal -8.99 m, Lateral -11.73 m
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal 0.76 m/s, Lateral 7.44 m/s
- **Trajectory and Motion Description**: Driving towards the ego car both longitudinally and laterally.

#### Analysis:
The trajectory shows the obstacle moving towards the ego car in both dimensions, but the longitudinal distance remains considerable.

- **TTC Longitudinal**: 8.99 m / 0.76 m/s ≈ 11.83 s
- **TTC Lateral**: 11.73 m / 7.44 m/s ≈ 1.58 s
- **MDC**: 1.73 m (considering minimal lateral overlap due to fast lateral closure)

#### Risk Assessment:
Based on lateral outpacing the longitudinal approach in near term:
- **Risk Score**: 3 (Medium Risk)

### 3. Obstacle 3395
- **Direction**: Behind
- **Adjusted Distances**: Longitudinal -0.01 m, Lateral 0.00 m
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal 5.20 m/s, Lateral 2.23 m/s
- **Trajectory and Motion Description**: Exact lateral alignment or unknown case.

#### Analysis:
The obstacle has aligned directly behind the ego vehicle longitudinally, and it's rapidly approaching. Given the near-zero longitudinal distance, the obstacle is essentially on a collision path.

- **TTC Longitudinal**: 0.01 m / 5.20 m/s ≈ 0.002 s
- **TTC Lateral**: 0.00 m / 2.23 m/s = 0.0 s (no need to compute)
- **MDC**: 0.01 m

#### Risk Assessment:
- **Risk Score**: 0 (Collision)

### Conclusion
Based on the analysis:

- Obstacle 3395 is in a collision scenario with the ego vehicle due to near-zero MDC and TTC.
- Thus, this is identified as a collision scenario.
