### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 3391
- Relative Direction: Left
- Distance Risk Reason: Obstacle 3391 has maintained a safe lateral distance over all timesteps, posing no longitudinal risk as it remains parallel to the ego vehicle. DTClat is consistently > 5 and DTClong is 0.
- Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 0
- Lateral Distance Safety Score: 5
- Overall Distance Safety Score: 5.0  (0 * 0.0 + 5 * (1 - 0.0) = 5)
- Time Risk Reason:  No longitudinal time to collision risk as the obstacle is parallel to the ego vehicle. No lateral risk due to large lateral distance and no relative lateral motion.
- Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 0
- Lateral Time Safety Score: 5
- Overall Time Safety Score: 5.0 (0 * 0.0 + 5 * (1 - 0.0) = 5)
- Overall Risk Score: 5 (0.5 * 5.0 + 0.5 * 5.0 = 5)

- Obstacle ID: 3393
- Relative Direction: Rear-right
- Distance Risk Reason:  Obstacle 3393 is approaching from behind and the right but currently at a safe longitudinal and lateral distance. DTClong and DTClat values over previous timesteps show decreasing distance and increasing risk but DTClong > 5 and DTClat > 5. 
- Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 5
- Lateral Distance Safety Score: 5
- Overall Distance Safety Score: 5.0 (5 * 0.5 + 5 * (1-0.5) = 5.0)
- Time Risk Reason: Although approaching, the obstacle has sufficient TTC in both directions. Trends show decreasing TTC values over time.  TTClong > 5 and 1 < TTClat <= 3.
- Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 5
- Lateral Time Safety Score: 3
- Overall Time Safety Score: 4.0 (5 * 0.5 + 3 * (1-0.5) = 4)
- Overall Risk Score: 5 (0.5 * 5.0 + 0.5 * 4.0 = 4.5, rounded to 5)

- Obstacle ID: 3395
- Relative Direction: Behind
- Distance Risk Reason: Obstacle 3395 is almost directly behind the ego vehicle and very close, presenting an extreme longitudinal collision risk. Lateral distance is negligible as it is directly behind.  DTClong has been consistently decreasing over time.
- Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 1
- Lateral Distance Safety Score: 0
- Overall Distance Safety Score: 1.0 (1 * 1.0 + 0 * (1 - 1.0) = 1)
- Time Risk Reason: Obstacle 3395 poses an extreme risk as TTClong is approaching 0, showing a clear collision course.  TTClat is also 0.
- Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 0
- Lateral Time Safety Score: 0
- Overall Time Safety Score: 0.0 (0 * 1.0 + 0 * (1-1.0) = 0)
- Overall Risk Score: 1 (0.5 * 1.0 + 0.5 * 0.0 = 0.5, rounded to 1)
