Obstacle 3511.0: This obstacle is stationary and located in the same lane as the ego vehicle, but it maintains a safe lateral distance and poses no immediate threat. Risk score: 4 (Low Risk)

Obstacle 3515.0: This obstacle is in the same lane as the ego vehicle and initially moving faster. However, it's decelerating significantly over the timesteps. While the distance between the ego and this obstacle is decreasing, the deceleration suggests that a collision is unlikely in the near future. The situation requires monitoring, but no immediate action seems necessary.  Risk score: 3 (Medium Risk)

Obstacle 3516.0: This obstacle is in a different lane (595) and moving away from the ego vehicle. While its velocity is high, the lateral separation and divergent trajectories suggest a negligible risk of collision. Risk score: 5 (Negligible Risk)

Obstacle 3519.0: This obstacle is in the same lane as the ego vehicle and moving slightly faster initially. Its velocity fluctuates slightly over the timesteps.  However, its trajectory doesn't indicate an immediate collision risk. Risk score: 4 (Low Risk)
