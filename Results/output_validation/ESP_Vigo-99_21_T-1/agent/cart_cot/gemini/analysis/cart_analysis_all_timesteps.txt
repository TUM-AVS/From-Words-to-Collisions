Obstacle 3515 is braking heavily while moving in the same lane as the ego vehicle and ahead of it.  There is a possibility of a rear-end collision if the ego vehicle does not react appropriately. Obstacle 3511 is stationary and does not present a risk. Obstacle 3519 is also in the same lane as the ego vehicle but further ahead and its motion does not pose an immediate threat. Obstacle 3516 is in a different lane and although moving with higher velocity, is not on a direct collision course with the ego vehicle at this time.
