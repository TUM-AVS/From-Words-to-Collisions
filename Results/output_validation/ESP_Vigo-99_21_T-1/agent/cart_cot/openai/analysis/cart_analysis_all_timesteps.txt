Upon reviewing the recent timesteps, particularly focusing on the object interactions at 14.3 seconds, here's the analysis:

1. **Obstacle 3511.0**:
   - It has remained stationary with zero velocity throughout the observation period.
   - It is relatively far from the ego vehicle, suggesting no immediate collision risk.
   - **Risk Score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)

2. **Obstacle 3515.0**:
   - Positioned close to the ego vehicle's lanelet, with a decreasing velocity trend.
   - The gradual reduction in speed implies it might stop or slow significantly before any potential intersection with the ego vehicle.
   - Given the progressively decreasing speed and the manageable distance trajectory, there is no immediate collision risk.
   - **Risk Score**: 3 (Medium Risk)

3. **Obstacle 3516.0**:
   - This obstacle is not present in the final analyzed timeframe, indicating it either moved away or is no longer relevant.
   - **Risk Score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)

4. **Obstacle 3519.0**:
   - Moving steadily along with the lane, with its trajectory align closely with the ego's route.
   - However, its velocity isn't high enough to catch up with the ego quickly.
   - While being closer, no immediate change in course or hazard to the ego.
   - **Risk Score**: 3 (Medium Risk)

No imminent collision or extreme risks are detected for obstacles near the ego vehicle. The nearest concerns were at manageable distances and with reducing velocity trends.
