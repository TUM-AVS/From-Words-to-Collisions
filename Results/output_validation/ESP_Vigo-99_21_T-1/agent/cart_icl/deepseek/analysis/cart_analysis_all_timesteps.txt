### Analysis:

1. **Obstacle 3511.0**:  
   - **Position**: (63.5087, -384.3391)  
   - **Velocity**: 0.0 (stationary)  
   - **Relative Position**: Behind and to the right of the ego vehicle.  
   - **Risk**: Low (4) - No motion, and lateral distance is significant.  

2. **Obstacle 3515.0**:  
   - **Position**: (58.7498, -367.9342)  
   - **Velocity**: 1.3247 m/s (decelerating)  
   - **Relative Position**: Ahead and to the left of the ego vehicle.  
   - **TTC**: Ego is moving very slowly (0.0438 m/s), and the obstacle is moving away.  
   - **Risk**: Low (4) - No immediate danger.  

3. **Obstacle 3516.0**:  
   - **Position**: (56.0327, -402.0228) at 14.0s (last observed)  
   - **Velocity**: 8.2836 m/s (high speed, moving away)  
   - **Relative Position**: Far behind and to the right, in a different lanelet (595.0).  
   - **Risk**: Negligible (5) - No meaningful risk due to lateral and longitudinal separation.  

4. **Obstacle 3519.0**:  
   - **Position**: (56.8150, -359.0728)  
   - **Velocity**: 1.5142 m/s (moderate speed, ahead of ego)  
   - **Relative Position**: Ahead and to the left, in the same lanelet (268.0).  
   - **TTC**: Ego is moving very slowly, and the obstacle is moving away.  
   - **Risk**: Low (4) - No immediate danger.  

### Highest Risks:
- No obstacles pose an immediate collision (0) or extreme risk (1).  
- All obstacles are either stationary, moving away, or sufficiently separated.
