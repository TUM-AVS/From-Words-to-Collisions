Obstacle 3511 is stationary and poses no immediate risk. Obstacle 3515 is in the same lane as the ego vehicle and is decelerating, but currently poses a medium risk.  Obstacle 3519 is also in the same lane and its behavior is somewhat erratic in terms of acceleration, but currently poses a medium risk as well.

Obstacle 3516, however, requires careful attention.  It appears to be cutting across lanes and is moving at a significantly higher speed than the ego vehicle. Although its lateral distance is currently large, its high velocity and changing heading suggests a potential high risk if it continues on its current trajectory. It's trajectory should be closely monitored in subsequent timesteps to ensure there is no collision risk.
