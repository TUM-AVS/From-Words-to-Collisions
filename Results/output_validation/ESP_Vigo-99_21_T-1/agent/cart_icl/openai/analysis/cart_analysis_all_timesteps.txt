**Scenario Analysis:**

The analysis will start by observing the ego vehicle and the obstacles over the given timesteps. We will examine their position, velocity, and lanelet information focusing on the latest timestep to gauge the risk and proximity between the ego and the obstacles.

**At 14.3 seconds:**

- **Ego Vehicle:**  
  - Position: (59.9628, -372.6765)
  - Lanelet: 268.0
  - Velocity: 0.0438 m/s

- **Obstacle 3511.0: (Stationary)**  
  - Position: (63.5087, -384.3391)
  - Lanelet: 268.0
  - Velocity: 0.0 m/s
  - Risk Analysis: Position is relatively far from Ego, no movement in trajectory. No immediate risk.  
  - Risk Level: 5 (Negligible Risk)

- **Obstacle 3515.0:**  
  - Position: (58.7498, -367.9342)
  - Lanelet: 268.0
  - Velocity: 1.3247 m/s
  - This obstacle maintains a trajectory towards the Ego, showing a history of decreasing speed.  
  - If movements converge with ego's path, risk increases. However, considering velocity and current distance, urgent action is not needed immediately.  
  - Risk Level: 3 (Medium Risk)

- **Obstacle 3516.0:**  
  - Previous position up to 14.0 seconds was noted, ceased to be monitored at 14.1-14.3 seconds in provided data.
  - No longer relevant at 14.3 seconds.

- **Obstacle 3519.0:**  
  - Position: (56.815, -359.0728)
  - Lanelet: 268.0
  - Velocity: 1.5142 m/s
  - The obstacle's trajectory and path keep it at a reasonable distance parallel to the ego without immediate intersection threat.  
  - Risk Level: 4 (Low Risk)

**Summary of Obstacles:**

- **Risk Score 0 (Unavoidable Collision):** None of the obstacles have an unavoidable collision scenario.  
- **Risk Score 1 (Extreme Risk):** None manifest urgent collision risk requiring immediate avoidance actions based on trajectory predictions at this moment.  
- **Risk Score 2 (High Risk):** None of the entities present a high risk with a need for immediate concern given the current data.

**Final JSON Output:**

```json
{
    "CollisionObstacles": [],
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null,
    "HighRiskObstacle": null
}
```

This structured format reflects the current collision assessment based on the data provided. The analysis concludes with no immediate extreme risks or unavoidable collisions based on the positions and velocities at the last reported moment.
