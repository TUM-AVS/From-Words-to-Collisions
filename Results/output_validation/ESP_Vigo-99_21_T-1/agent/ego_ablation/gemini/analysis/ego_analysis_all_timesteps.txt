At timestamp 14.3 seconds, the following obstacles are present:

* **Obstacle 3511:** Located 7.67m in front of the ego vehicle, with a very small negative relative longitudinal velocity (-0.04 m/s).  This indicates the obstacle is nearly stationary or slightly moving towards the ego vehicle. While there's no immediate collision risk, the proximity warrants attention.  Given the MDC > 5 meters and TTC > 5 seconds (assumed based on near-zero relative velocity and substantial distance), the risk level is negligible.  Proximity score: 4, MDC score: 5, TTC score: 5.

* **Obstacle 3515:** Located -0.39m *behind* the ego vehicle (meaning slightly more than a foot inside the ego vehicle's rear boundaries). This clearly represents a collision. Proximity score: 0, MDC score: 0, TTC score: 0.

* **Obstacle 3519:**  Located -9.45m behind the ego vehicle with a relative longitudinal velocity of 1.47m/s. This obstacle is approaching the ego vehicle from behind.  Although some distance remains, the closing speed could present a near-term risk.  Roughly TTC is 9.45m / 1.47 m/s = 6.4 seconds, resulting in a low risk. However, the risk is increasing in comparison to previous timestamps and requires careful monitoring. proximity score: 4, MDC score: 5, TTC score: 5.
