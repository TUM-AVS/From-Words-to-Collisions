### Safety analysis for timestep 14.3s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

Given that the provided scenario only includes real distances and relative velocities, we will perform a simplified TTC calculation and use the provided distances as proxies for MDC.  A proper TTC calculation requires accurate relative accelerations and would ideally incorporate the vehicle dimensions into the distance calculations as alluded to with "adjusted distances". The analysis will focus on the final provided timestep (14.3s) and refer to previous timesteps for trajectory context.

**Assumptions & Simplifications:**

* **MDC Approximation:** Since adjusted distances are not provided, real distances (DTClong, DTClat) will be used as approximations for Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC). This assumption affects the accuracy of risk assessments.
* **Simplified TTC Calculation:**  Due to fluctuating or unavailable acceleration data, TTC will be simplified as Distance / Velocity.  This simplification assumes constant velocity and might not accurately represent real-world scenarios.  Lateral TTC (TTClat) will be calculated using absolute lateral velocity to represent the time until the lateral distance becomes zero, regardless of the direction.
* **Combined TTC:**  An overall TTC is not computed due to the complexities of combining longitudinal and lateral TTCs reliably without more sophisticated trajectory predictions.  Instead, longitudinal and lateral TTC are considered separately and contribute to the overall risk assessment.
* **"Exact lateral alignment or unknown case" Interpretation:** This phrase will be interpreted as potentially leading to a collision if the longitudinal trajectory also poses a risk.

### Obstacle Analysis:

**- Obstacle ID: 3511**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is 7.67m in front of the ego vehicle, representing some proximity.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: The obstacle has a very small negative longitudinal velocity, indicating it might be nearly stationary or slightly moving towards the ego vehicle. The simplified TTC calculation is unreliable here. Based on other timesteps, we take note of its rather consistent longitudinal position relative to the ego vehicle and thus won't consider it as a collision risk.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

**- Obstacle ID: 3515**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is very close behind the ego vehicle (-0.39m indicates it is practically touching).
- Distance safety score: 1
- Time Risk reason:  The obstacle is approaching rapidly from behind, with positive longitudinal velocity.  The small distance and closing velocity create an extreme risk scenario.
- Time safety score: 1
- Overall Risk score: 1

**- Obstacle ID: 3516**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is far away from the ego vehicle (23.22m) in the front-right direction.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: The obstacle is moving away from the ego vehicle both longitudinally and laterally.  No collision risk is perceived.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

**- Obstacle ID: 3519**
- Distance Risk reason:  Obstacle is at a moderate distance behind the ego vehicle (-9.45m).
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: The obstacle is approaching from behind. The greater distance compared to Obstacle 3515 gives more reaction time. 
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3
