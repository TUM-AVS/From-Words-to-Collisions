Using the information from the most recent timestep, combined with past data from previous timesteps, let's analyze the potential collision and risk levels for each obstacle in the current scenario:

### Obstacle Analysis

#### Obstacle 3511:
- **Position**: Front of the ego vehicle
- **Adjusted Longitudinal Distance**: 7.67 m
- **Relative Longitudinal Velocity**: -0.04 m/s (approaching slowly)
  
**Trajectory Analysis**:
- Over multiple timesteps, the distance consistently remained around 7.69 m to 7.67 m with minimal velocity change, indicating near-stationarity.

**TTC Calculation**:
- TTC = 7.67 m / 0.04 m/s = 191.75 seconds
  
**Assessment**:
- MDC is around 7.67 m and the velocity is very low indicating no significant risk.
- **Risk Level**: 5 (Negligible Risk)

#### Obstacle 3515:
- **Position**: Behind the ego vehicle
- **Adjusted Longitudinal Distance**: -0.39 m (indicating behind)
- **Relative Longitudinal Velocity**: 1.28 m/s (approaching)

**Trajectory Analysis**:
- The longitudinal distance is rapidly decreasing as the obstacle speeds up towards the ego vehicle.

**TTC Calculation**:
- TTC = 0.39 m / 1.28 m/s = 0.30 seconds
  
**Assessment**:
- Given the extremely short TTC and decreasing distance, the obstacle is at extreme risk of collision.
- **Risk Level**: 1 (Extreme Risk)

#### Obstacle 3516:
- **Position**: Front-right
- **Adjusted Longitudinal Distance**: 22.77 m
- **Adjusted Lateral Distance**: -8.81 m
- **Relative Longitudinal Velocity**: 1.29 m/s (moving away)
- **Relative Lateral Velocity**: -8.16 m/s (moving away)

**Trajectory Analysis**:
- The longitudinal distance slightly varied with the relative velocity indicating it’s moving away.

**TTC Calculation**:
- No collision risk since both longitudinal and lateral distances are increasing and with diverging velocities.

**Assessment**:
- Given large distances and diverging paths, this obstacle poses no risk.
- **Risk Level**: 5 (Negligible Risk)

#### Obstacle 3519:
- **Position**: Behind the ego vehicle
- **Adjusted Longitudinal Distance**: -9.45 m
- **Relative Longitudinal Velocity**: 1.47 m/s

**Trajectory Analysis**:
- The distance is decreasing with positive velocity implying it’s speeding up towards the ego vehicle.

**TTC Calculation**:
- TTC = 9.45 m / 1.47 m/s = 6.43 seconds
  
**Assessment**:
- Though approaching from behind, the TTC and MDC provide sufficient time for corrective action.
- **Risk Level**: 4 (Low Risk)
