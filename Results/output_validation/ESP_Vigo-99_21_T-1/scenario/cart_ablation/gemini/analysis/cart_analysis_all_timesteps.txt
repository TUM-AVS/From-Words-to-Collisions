At t=14.5s, Ego (ID 3518) is at (59.9651, -372.685) with velocity 0.0438 m/s.

Obstacle 3511 is stationary at (63.5087, -384.3391).  No immediate risk due to lateral separation and Ego's low speed. Risk score: 4 (Low).

Obstacle 3515 is at (58.81, -368.177) with velocity 1.2063 m/s. It is approaching Ego from behind in the same lane, but sufficient longitudinal separation exists for now. Risk score: 3 (Medium).  Monitoring needed as 3515 decelerates.

Obstacle 3519 is at (56.8755, -359.3623) with velocity 1.459 m/s. It is also in the same lane and further behind than 3515.  Risk score: 4 (Low).


Obstacle 3516, though laterally distant at (not provided, -not provided) in a different lane (595), is disregarded for collision analysis in this Cartesian coordinate framework. It represents a low risk (4) despite its high velocity and acceleration as it does not pose an immediate collision risk.

No obstacles present a collision or extreme risk.
