Obstacle 3515 is in the same lane as the ego vehicle and its x-coordinate is approaching the ego vehicle's x-coordinate. While Obstacle 3515 is decelerating, its current velocity and proximity suggest a high risk of collision in the immediate future if the ego vehicle does not react.  Obstacle 3519 is also in the same lane and even closer to the ego vehicle than Obstacle 3515, posing an even greater risk of collision if the ego vehicle does not react immediately.

        "Reasoning": "Obstacle 3519 is very close to the ego vehicle in the same lane and poses an immediate collision risk. Obstacle 3515 is also a concern due to its proximity and closing velocity, but 3519 represents the most immediate danger."
