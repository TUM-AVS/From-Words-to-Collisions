### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 3511.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is laterally separated and far from ego, maintaining a safe distance over time.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Obstacle is stationary, posing no immediate time-based risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 3515.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is in the same lane and approaching ego, but still at a safe distance. The closing distance requires monitoring.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason:  Obstacle is decelerating, reducing the risk of collision over the observed time.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- Obstacle ID: 3516.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is in a different lane and moving away from ego. Lateral and longitudinal separation is significant.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Obstacle's trajectory indicates no risk of interaction with the ego vehicle.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 3519.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is in the same lane and ahead of the ego vehicle, but with a safe distance.  The distance is decreasing slightly over time, requiring continued monitoring.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Obstacle is slightly decelerating.  The relative velocity suggests no immediate threat, but monitoring is needed.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4


### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
No obstacle shows an immediate risk of collision. All obstacles maintain a safe distance or are moving away from the ego vehicle. Deceleration of obstacles 3515.0 and 3519.0 further reduces risk over the analyzed timesteps.  This is not a collision scenario.
