### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep:

#### Obstacle Analysis:

1. **Obstacle ID: 3511.0**
   - **Distance Risk Reason**: The obstacle has not moved for the last 10 timesteps, remaining stationary at a position significantly away from the ego vehicle.
   - **Distance Safety Score**: 5
   - **Time Risk Reason**: With zero velocity and zero acceleration, there's no risk of future movement towards the ego vehicle.
   - **Time Safety Score**: 5
   - **Overall Risk Score**: 5

2. **Obstacle ID: 3515.0**
   - **Distance Risk Reason**: The obstacle is moving in the same lanelet with a slight deceleration. Currently, it is following a path ahead of the ego vehicle but at a relatively safe distance.
   - **Distance Safety Score**: 4
   - **Time Risk Reason**: The decreasing velocity and consistent negative acceleration indicate it is slowing down further away.
   - **Time Safety Score**: 4
   - **Overall Risk Score**: 4

3. **Obstacle ID: 3519.0**
   - **Distance Risk Reason**: The obstacle is on a similar path but slightly ahead of the ego vehicle. It maintains a safe lateral distance at its velocity.
   - **Distance Safety Score**: 4
   - **Time Risk Reason**: The acceleration and velocity changes are minor, with the obstacle maintaining a steady pace.
   - **Time Safety Score**: 4
   - **Overall Risk Score**: 4

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
This is not a collision scenario as all relevant obstacles are maintaining safe distances and trajectories relative to the ego vehicle. The static obstacle (3511.0) poses no threat. While other obstacles are on the same path, they are either moving steadily or slowing down, reducing any potential risk of collision.
