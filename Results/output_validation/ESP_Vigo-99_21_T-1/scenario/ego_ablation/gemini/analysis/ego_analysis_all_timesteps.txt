Obstacle 3515 is behind the ego vehicle and poses an extreme risk. It is only 0.14 meters behind the ego vehicle and closing at 1.16 m/s.  This implies a very high likelihood of a rear-end collision within the next timestep.

Obstacle 3511 is in front of the ego vehicle at a distance of 7.67 meters.  While it is moving slowly towards the ego vehicle, the distance and relative velocity suggest no immediate risk.

Obstacle 3519 is behind the ego vehicle at a distance of 9.15 meters and moving towards the ego vehicle at 1.41 m/s. This represents a potential risk, but not immediate.

Obstacle 3516 is moving away from the ego vehicle and poses no risk.

  "ScenarioAnalysis": {
    "IsCollisionScenario": false,
    "Reasoning": "Obstacle 3515 poses an extreme risk due to its very close proximity behind the ego vehicle and its closing velocity.  While not a collision yet, a collision is highly likely in the next timestep if no evasive action is taken.  Other obstacles do not pose an immediate collision risk."
