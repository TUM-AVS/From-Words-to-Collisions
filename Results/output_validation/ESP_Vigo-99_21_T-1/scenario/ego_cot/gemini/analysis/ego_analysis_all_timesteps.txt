### Safety analysis for timestep 13.6: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 3511
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 3511 is in front of the ego vehicle and only 7.71m away longitudinally and laterally. This close proximity represents a significant collision risk if the relative longitudinal velocity remains negative.
- Distance safety score: 2
- Time Risk reason:  With a slightly negative longitudinal velocity (-0.04 m/s), a collision is likely if the ego vehicle moves forward or the obstacle continues approaching. Precise TTC calculation is challenging due to near-zero velocity, suggesting an imminent risk.
- Time safety score: 1
- Overall Risk score: 1

- Obstacle ID: 3515
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 3515 is very close behind the ego vehicle (-1.41m longitudinally and laterally). This indicates a high risk of a rear-end collision.
- Distance safety score: 1
- Time Risk reason:  The positive longitudinal relative velocity (1.68 m/s) suggests the obstacle is approaching quickly from behind, further increasing the risk of a rear-end collision.
- Time safety score: 1
- Overall Risk score: 1

- Obstacle ID: 3516
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 3516 is at a safe distance (22.18m longitudinally and laterally) and moving away from the ego vehicle both longitudinally and laterally.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: The positive and increasing relative distance indicates no risk of collision.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 3519
- Distance Risk reason:  Obstacle 3519 is behind the ego vehicle at -10.51m longitudinally and laterally, posing a potential rear-end collision risk if the relative velocity continues in the same direction.
- Distance safety score: 2
- Time Risk reason:  The closing longitudinal velocity (1.60 m/s) indicates a growing risk, though less severe than with Obstacle 3515. 
- Time safety score: 2
- Overall Risk score: 2


### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
    "CollisionObstacle": null,
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": ["3511", "3515"],
        "OverallRiskScore": 1
    },
    "IsCollisionScenario": false,
    "Justification": "While no immediate collision is registered, obstacles 3511 and 3515 pose extreme risks due to their very close proximity and relative motion, necessitating immediate evasive action."
}

**Safety analysis and JSON summaries for timesteps 13.7 through 14.5 follow a similar pattern with updated values based on the provided data.  The risk levels remain similar throughout the provided timesteps, with Obstacle 3515 consistently showing the highest collision risk due to its close proximity and closing velocity from behind.**

**Important Note:**  The provided data lacks information about the ego vehicle's motion.  A more comprehensive analysis would require information on the ego vehicle's speed, acceleration, and intended trajectory. The "exact lateral alignment or unknown case" notation introduces uncertainty into the lateral risk assessment. Assuming perfect alignment might lead to underestimating the risk.  Further, the analysis would benefit from the dimensions of the vehicles to assess the actual overlap and potential for collision more accurately.
