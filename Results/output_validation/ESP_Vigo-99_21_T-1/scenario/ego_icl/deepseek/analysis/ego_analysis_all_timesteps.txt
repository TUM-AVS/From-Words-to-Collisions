Let me analyze the most recent timestep (14.5 seconds) and assess collision risks for each obstacle:

1. Obstacle 3511 (Front):
   - Longitudinal distance: 7.67m (stable)
   - Lateral distance: 0.00m (exact alignment)
   - Relative velocity: -0.04m/s (very slowly approaching)
   - TTC: 7.67/0.04 = 191.75s (No Risk)
   - MDC: 7.67m (No Risk)
   - Overall Risk: 5 (No Risk) - Moving very slowly toward ego but at safe distance

2. Obstacle 3515 (Behind):
   - Longitudinal distance: -0.14m (very close behind)
   - Lateral distance: 0.00m (exact alignment)
   - Relative velocity: 1.16m/s (approaching quickly)
   - TTC: 0.14/1.16 = 0.12s (Extreme Risk)
   - MDC: 0.14m (Extreme Risk)
   - Overall Risk: 1 (Extreme Risk) - About to collide from behind within 0.14m at high speed

3. Obstacle 3519 (Behind):
   - Longitudinal distance: -9.15m
   - Lateral distance: 0.00m
   - Relative velocity: 1.41m/s
   - TTC: 9.15/1.41 = 6.49s (No Risk)
   - MDC: 9.15m (No Risk)
   - Overall Risk: 5 (No Risk) - Following at safe distance

Trajectory Analysis:
- Obstacle 3515 has been rapidly closing the distance from behind (from -1.41m at 13.6s to -0.14m at 14.5s)
- The relative velocity has been consistently positive (approaching) around 1.2-1.6m/s
- At current rate, will collide with ego within the next 0.1s timestep

This is a collision scenario because Obstacle 3515 has:
1. Extreme Risk score (1)
2. TTC of just 0.12 seconds
3. MDC of only 0.14 meters
4. Converging trajectory with exact lateral alignment
