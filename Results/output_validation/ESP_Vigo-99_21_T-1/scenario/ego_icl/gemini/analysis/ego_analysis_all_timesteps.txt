* **Obstacle 3511 (Front):** This obstacle remains directly in front of the ego vehicle (lateral distance 0.00m) throughout the provided timestamps. The longitudinal distance slightly decreases from 7.71m to 7.67m, indicating very slow closing. The relative longitudinal velocity is -0.04 m/s, meaning the obstacle is slightly moving away from the ego vehicle.  Given the slow closing velocity and stable longitudinal distance around 7.67m, the TTC is large and MDC is > 5.0m. This indicates a low risk.

* **Obstacle 3515 (Behind):** This obstacle is approaching the ego vehicle from behind, remaining laterally aligned (0.00m). The longitudinal distance rapidly decreases from -1.41m to -0.14m (meaning getting closer from behind).  The relative longitudinal velocity is around 1.16 m/s at the last timestamp. Calculating TTC: 0.14m / 1.16 m/s ≈ 0.12s.  MDC is < 0.5m. This is an **Extreme Risk (1)** due to the very low TTC and close proximity with converging trajectories, indicating an imminent rear-end collision.

* **Obstacle 3516 (Front-Right):** This obstacle starts at a longitudinal distance of 22.18m and lateral distance of -6.97m. Over the timestamps, it moves further away both longitudinally and laterally from the ego vehicle. The increasing distances and negative relative velocities indicate no risk of collision.

* **Obstacle 3519 (Behind):** This obstacle approaches the ego from behind, similar to Obstacle 3515, with a lateral distance of 0.00m. The longitudinal distance steadily decreases from -10.51m to -9.15m. At the last timestamp, the relative longitudinal velocity is 1.41 m/s. TTC calculation: 9.15m / 1.41m/s ≈ 6.5s. The MDC is > 5m. This is a low risk situation at the moment, though monitoring is necessary.

**Collision Scenario Determination:** Yes, this is a collision scenario. Obstacle 3515 poses an Extreme Risk (1) with a very low TTC (0.12s) and very small MDC (<0.5m) at the last timestamp, indicating a high probability of a rear-end collision in the immediate future.
