To evaluate the collision risks in the given scenario, we'll perform an obstacle-by-obstacle analysis for the most recent timestep (14.5 seconds). We'll analyze the trajectory changes from previous timesteps to estimate potential collision risks. This will involve calculating the Time-to-Collision (TTC) and Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC) while considering longitudinal and lateral dynamics. We'll particularly focus on the adjusted longitudinal and lateral distances, which account for actual vehicle sizes. Following this analysis, a risk score will be assigned to each obstacle, and we'll determine if this scenario constitutes a collision scenario.

### Obstacle-by-Obstacle Analysis:

#### Obstacle 3511
- **Position**: Front of ego vehicle
- **Adjusted Distance**: Use provided values (assuming direct distances due to lack of explicit adjusted data)
- **Longitudinal Distance**: 7.67 m
- **Lateral Distance**: 0.00 m
- **Relative Velocity**: -0.04 m/s (longitudinal), 0.00 m/s (lateral)

**Trajectory Analysis**:
- Longitudinal distance has remained fairly stable from 7.71 m to 7.67 m over several seconds, indicating a very slow closing speed.
- The obstacle is longitudinally aligned, suggesting it's in the same lane.
- **TTC Calculation**: Not applicable as relative velocity is negative (obstacle slowly moving away), ensuring no immediate collision.
- **MDC Calculation**: Given stable separation and low closing speed, MDC > 5.0m indicative of no risk.

**Risk Score**: 5 (No Risk)

#### Obstacle 3515
- **Position**: Behind the ego vehicle
- **Adjusted Distance**: -0.14 m longitudinally, 0.00 m laterally
- **Relative Velocity**: 1.16 m/s (longitudinal), -0.04 m/s (lateral)

**Trajectory Analysis**:
- Longitudinal distances moved from -1.41 m to -0.14 m, indicating rapid approach.
- Obstacle is exactly aligned longitudinally and potentially aligning in the same lane.

**TTC Calculation**: \[ \text{TTC} = \frac{0.14}{1.16} \approx 0.12 \, \text{seconds (extremely low)} \]
**MDC Calculation**: Since the obstacle is closing to within 0.5 meters very quickly. At time of analysis, extremely close, suggesting extreme risk.

**Risk Score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)

#### Obstacle 3519
- **Position**: Behind the ego vehicle
- **Adjusted Distance**: -9.15 m longitudinally, 0.00 m laterally
- **Relative Velocity**: 1.41 m/s (longitudinal), -0.10 m/s (lateral)

**Trajectory Analysis**:
- Obstacle is approaching from behind at a considerable distance.
- Relative velocity is positive and stable, indicating continual approach but substantial distance.

**TTC Calculation**: \[ \text{TTC} = \frac{9.15}{1.41} \approx 6.49 \, \text{seconds} \] Indicates a no-risk or low-risk situation.
**MDC Calculation**: Given the large distance, MDC > 5.0m indicating no immediate collision threat.

**Risk Score**: 5 (No Risk)

### Collision Scenario Determination
- **Obstacle 3515** is at an extremely low distance and has a high relative closing speed, presenting immediate risk of collision.
- A risk score of 1 (Extreme Risk) for Obstacle 3515 marks this as a collision scenario.
