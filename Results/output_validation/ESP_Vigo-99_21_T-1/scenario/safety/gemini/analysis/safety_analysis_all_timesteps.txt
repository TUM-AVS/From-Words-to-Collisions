### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
                    - Obstacle ID: 3511
                    - Relative Direction: Front
                    - Distance Risk Reason: DTClong is 7.67m, which is > 5, indicating negligible risk longitudinally. DTClat is 0.00m indicating a collision risk laterally. Since the relative direction is Front, the longitudinal distance is dominant. Over the past several timesteps, DTClong has been decreasing slightly, but remains above 5 meters.
                    - Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 5
                    - Lateral Distance Safety Score: 0
                    - Overall Distance Safety Score: 5.0
                    - Time Risk Reason: TTClong is 175.14s, indicating negligible risk longitudinally. TTClat is 0.00s, meaning collision risk is present. The dominant direction is Front. Over the past several timesteps, TTClong has remained very high.
                    - Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 5
                    - Lateral Time Safety Score: 0
                    - Overall Time Safety Score: 5.0
                    - Overall Risk Score: 5

                    - Obstacle ID: 3515
                    - Relative Direction: Behind
                    - Distance Risk Reason: DTClong is -0.14m, indicating extreme risk longitudinally. DTClat is 0.00m, indicating collision risk laterally.  Since the relative direction is Behind, the longitudinal distance is dominant.  DTClong shows the obstacle rapidly approaching over the previous timesteps.
                    - Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 1
                    - Lateral Distance Safety Score: 0
                    - Overall Distance Safety Score: 1.0
                    - Time Risk Reason: TTClong is 0.12s, indicating extreme risk longitudinally. TTClat is 0.00s, indicating collision risk laterally. The dominant direction is Behind. TTClong has been decreasing rapidly in previous timesteps, showing imminent collision risk.
                    - Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 1
                    - Lateral Time Safety Score: 0
                    - Overall Time Safety Score: 1.0
                    - Overall Risk Score: 1

                    - Obstacle ID: 3519
                    - Relative Direction: Behind
                    - Distance Risk Reason: DTClong is -9.15m which is < -5m, indicating negligible risk longitudinally. DTClat is 0.00m, indicating collision risk laterally.  Since the relative direction is Behind, the longitudinal component is dominant. DTClong has been increasing slightly over previous timesteps.
                    - Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 5
                    - Lateral Distance Safety Score: 0
                    - Overall Distance Safety Score: 5.0
                    - Time Risk Reason: TTClong is 6.48s, indicating negligible risk longitudinally. TTClat is 0.00s indicating collision risk laterally. The dominant direction is Behind. Over the past several timesteps TTClong has remained above 5s.
                    - Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 5
                    - Lateral Time Safety Score: 0
                    - Overall Time Safety Score: 5.0
                    - Overall Risk Score: 5
