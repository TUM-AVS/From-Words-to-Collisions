Here's the collision risk analysis:

**Ego Vehicle (3514.0):** The ego vehicle is changing lanes and accelerating. This maneuver needs careful monitoring concerning surrounding obstacles.

**Obstacle 3511.0:**  This obstacle poses negligible risk. It exhibits very low velocity and acceleration, remaining virtually stationary throughout the scenario. Its location is far from the ego vehicle's trajectory. Risk Score: 5

**Obstacle 3512.0:** This obstacle initially presents a medium risk. It is in a different lane but is accelerating and moving somewhat toward the ego vehicle's path. However, as the scenario progresses, it diverges and moves into a different lane, the risk is reduced to low. Further monitoring is needed. Risk Score: 3.

**Obstacle 3513.0:** This obstacle is in a different lane and moving in roughly the same direction. It doesn't pose any immediate risk and maintains distance. Risk Score: 4.

**Obstacle 3515.0:** This obstacle is stationary and far from the ego vehicle's trajectory, posing negligible risk. Risk Score: 5.

**Obstacle 3517.0:** This obstacle is in the same lane as the ego vehicle and initially travels at a similar speed. At 3.5 seconds, it presented a medium risk. However, at 3.6 and 3.7 seconds, it began to decelerate slightly, and at 3.8 seconds, it has decelerated further. At 3.9 and 4.0 seconds, it accelerates but has clear distance to the ego vehicle. This obstacle requires continuous monitoring. Risk Score: 3.

**Obstacle 3520.0:** This obstacle is also in the same lane as the ego vehicle and initially travels at a slightly higher speed. At 3.5 seconds, it is further ahead of the ego vehicle and poses less of a risk. At 3.6-3.8 seconds, it continues its path with varying accelerations. However, the distance to the ego vehicle remains substantial, and their paths do not seem to converge.  The risk is therefore low. Further monitoring is needed. Risk Score: 4.
