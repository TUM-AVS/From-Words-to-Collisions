Obstacle 3511: This obstacle is far from the ego vehicle and remains stationary (or very close to it).  It poses no risk. Risk score: 5

Obstacle 3512: This obstacle is initially somewhat close to the ego vehicle, but it's moving away and its trajectory doesn't intersect with the ego vehicle's path. Risk score: 3.

Obstacle 3513: This obstacle is far from the ego vehicle and is moving in a different direction, posing no risk. Risk score 5.

Obstacle 3515: This obstacle is stationary and located relatively far from the ego vehicle.  It poses no risk. Risk score: 5

Obstacle 3517: This obstacle is in the same lane as the ego vehicle and initially relatively close. While both are moving forward, Obstacle 3517's speed decreases over time, further reducing the risk. Risk score: 4

Obstacle 3520:  This obstacle is in the same lane as the ego vehicle and behind it. While it is moving faster than the ego vehicle, it's moving in the same direction, and the distance between them is not decreasing rapidly enough to warrant a high risk.  Risk score: 4
