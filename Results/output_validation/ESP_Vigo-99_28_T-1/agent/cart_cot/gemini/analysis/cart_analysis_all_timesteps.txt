Obstacle 3512 shows concerning behavior. It's accelerating and changing lanes, moving closer to the ego vehicle's path. While not an immediate collision risk in the most recent timestep (4.4 seconds), the rapid acceleration and lane change suggest a potential for high risk in the next few timesteps.  Obstacle 3517 is in the same lane as the ego vehicle and although it's moving slightly slower, requires monitoring.
