In the scenario provided, the most recent timesteps show the following:

### Analysis of Obstacle Movements:

1. **Obstacle 3511 (Stationary in Lanelet 268):**
   - Velocity is nearly zero across all timesteps, indicating it is stationary or moving very slowly.
   - The lanelet position remains unchanged and considerably far from the ego position trajectory, posing no immediate risk.

2. **Obstacle 3512:**
   - Its velocity is relatively high and increasing over time, with significant acceleration.
   - It crosses from lanelet 2100 to lanelet 595, potentially posing a collision risk if it intersects with the ego trajectory due to its unpredictable path change and high velocity.

3. **Obstacle 3513:**
   - Moves consistently but remains in lanelet 1315, which is distant from the ego vehicle's trajectory.
   - Not currently in a position/velocity threatening immediate collision risk with the ego.

4. **Obstacle 3515 (Stationary in Lanelet 268):**
   - Stationary throughout and located in a lanelet far from the ego vehicle's path, implying no collision risk.

5. **Obstacle 3517:**
   - Positioned in the same lanelet as the ego, with moderate velocity and some deceleration over time.
   - Its proximity and shared lanelet may cause close interactions but not immediate collision risk at the current trajectory.

6. **Obstacle 3520:**
   - Shares the lanelet with the ego and maintains a high velocity similar to the ego.
   - Since the trajectory and positional analysis show proximity and similar orientation, there may be potential for close calls, needing urgent attention.

### Conclusion:
- **Obstacle 3512** presents a high risk due to its high speed, lanelet changes, and trajectory that could intersect with ego's path.
- **Obstacle 3520** warrants attention due to its path aligning closely with the ego and similar speed, posing near-term collision potential.
