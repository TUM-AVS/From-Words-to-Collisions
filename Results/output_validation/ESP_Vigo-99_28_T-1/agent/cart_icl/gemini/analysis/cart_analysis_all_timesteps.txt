Obstacle 3512 shows a concerning trend. It is approaching the ego vehicle rapidly, evidenced by its high velocity and acceleration.  Its lane changes across the timesteps also suggest unpredictable behavior, increasing the risk of a collision. While not immediately colliding, the rapid approach warrants a high risk assessment. Obstacle 3517 is in the same lane as the ego vehicle and its behavior is relatively stable with regards to its acceleration and velocity but its position and velocity relative to the ego vehicle suggest that action may be needed to mitigate a potential collision.
