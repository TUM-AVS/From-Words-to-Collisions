To evaluate this scenario, we'll analyze the behavior of each obstacle at the most recent timestep, 4.4 seconds, in relation to the Ego vehicle.

**Ego vehicle status at 4.4 seconds:**
- Position: (72.5629, -396.9805)
- Velocity: 5.8457 m/s
- Lanelet: 2230.0

**Obstacle Analysis:**

1. **Obstacle 3511.0**
   - Position: (61.2698, -377.1764)
   - Velocity: 0.0034 m/s (almost stationary)
   - Lanelet: 268.0
   - Far behind Ego, very slow speed, negligible risk.

2. **Obstacle 3512.0**
   - Position: (60.988, -399.935)
   - Velocity: 9.5166 m/s (moving relatively fast)
   - Lanelet: 595.0
   - Approaching Ego vehicle from behind with a significant velocity difference. However, it is in a different lanelet/may not be in the direct path.

3. **Obstacle 3513.0**
   - Position: (59.3261, -418.4075)
   - Velocity: 7.3184 m/s
   - Lanelet: 1315.0
   - Quite far behind the Ego vehicle, not in immediate danger. Different lanelet as well.

4. **Obstacle 3515.0**
   - Position: (63.5087, -384.3391)
   - Velocity: 0.0 m/s (stationary)
   - Lanelet: 268.0
   - Stationary, far lateral and longitudinal separation, negligible risk.

5. **Obstacle 3517.0**
   - Position: (77.2208, -394.8415)
   - Velocity: 7.6028 m/s
   - Lanelet: 466.0
   - Close to Ego in both position and lanelet, moving at similar speed. This could pose a risk if the lanes merge or if any abrupt maneuvers are made.

6. **Obstacle 3520.0**
   - Position: (91.1374, -388.5434)
   - Velocity: 7.6731 m/s
   - Lanelet: 466.0
   - Ahead of Ego, moving with similar speed. Given it shares lanelet, moderate risk if Ego and obstacle's paths converge.

**Risk Assessment for 4.4s:**

- **Obstacle 3517.0**: Most concerning due to proximity and same lanelet, but still manageable risk considering current speed and lane.
- **Ego vs 3512.0 & 3517.0**: No immediate collision paths, but closer monitoring needed with obstacle 3517.0.

Let's now output the most at-risk obstacle or any collision obstacles:

```json
{
    "CollisionObstacles": [],
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "3517.0",
        "OverallRiskScore": 2
    },
    "HighRiskObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "3512.0",
        "OverallRiskScore": 2
    }
}
```

This JSON indicates no physical contact or unavoidable collision but highlights the obstacles with medium to high-risk potential based on proximity and velocity in the latest timestep.
