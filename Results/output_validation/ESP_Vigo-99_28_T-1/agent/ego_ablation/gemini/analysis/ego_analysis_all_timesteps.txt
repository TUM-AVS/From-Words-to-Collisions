At timestamp 4.4 seconds, the following obstacles present risks:

* **Obstacle 3511**: Located to the right (0.0m longitudinal, -21.15m lateral), there is no longitudinal collision risk.  Given the lateral distance and the ego vehicle's presumed width, a collision is unlikely. Proximity (5), MDC (5), TTC (5). No risk.

* **Obstacle 3512:** Located front-right (7.17m longitudinal, -0.93m lateral), moving away longitudinally but slightly towards the ego laterally. Ample longitudinal distance and separation. Proximity (4), MDC (5), TTC (5). Low risk.

* **Obstacle 3513:** Located front-left (16.92m longitudinal, 11.63m lateral), moving slightly towards the ego longitudinally but away laterally. No collision risk. Proximity (5), MDC (5), TTC (5). No risk.

* **Obstacle 3515:** Located to the right (0.0 longitudinal, -13.75m lateral) moving away longitudinally. Similar to Obstacle 3511, no collision risk due to lateral separation. Proximity (5), MDC (5), TTC (5). No risk.

* **Obstacle 3517:** Located behind (-0.61m longitudinal, 0.0m lateral), approaching the ego.  The small longitudinal distance and the closing velocity suggests a high risk of collision. Proximity (2), MDC (1), TTC (1). Extreme Risk.

* **Obstacle 3520:** Located behind (-15.88m longitudinal, 0.0m lateral) and approaching longitudinally. Sufficient distance for reaction. Proximity (4), MDC (5), TTC (5). Low risk.
