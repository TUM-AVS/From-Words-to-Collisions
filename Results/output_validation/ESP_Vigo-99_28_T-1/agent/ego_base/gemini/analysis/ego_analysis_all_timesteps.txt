At timestamp 4.4 seconds, Obstacle 3517 is closest to the ego vehicle with a longitudinal distance of -0.61m (behind the ego vehicle).  It is approaching the ego vehicle with a relative longitudinal velocity of 1.75 m/s and positive relative longitudinal acceleration of 1.59 m/sÂ².  Given the short distance and closing velocity, this obstacle represents a high risk.

Obstacle 3515 and 3511 are both laterally aligned with the ego vehicle at 0.0m longitudinally but have significant lateral distances (-13.75m and -21.15m respectively) and are moving parallel with a high lateral velocity.  They represent a low risk.

Obstacle 3512 is moving away from the ego vehicle longitudinally (3.66 m/s) and laterally (-0.36 m/s) with a distance of 7.17m longitudinally and -0.93m laterally and represents a negligible risk.

Obstacle 3513 is far away with a longitudinal distance of 16.92m and moving away laterally at 4.82 m/s.  It represents a negligible risk.

Obstacle 3520 is behind the ego vehicle (-15.88m longitudinally) and approaching with a longitudinal velocity of 1.82m/s. Given the distance, it represents a low risk currently.

Risk Levels:
0: Collision - Physical contact occurred or unavoidable
1: Extreme Risk - Immediate collision likely
2: High Risk - Close to collision, needs quick action
3: Medium Risk - Manageable with proper reaction
4: Low Risk - Minimal risk, sufficient time to react
5: Negligible Risk - No significant risk
