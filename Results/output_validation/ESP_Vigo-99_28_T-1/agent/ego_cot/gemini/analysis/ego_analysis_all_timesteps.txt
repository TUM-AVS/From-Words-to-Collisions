### Safety analysis for timestep 4.4s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

**Assumptions and Clarifications:**

* **Missing Adjusted Distances:** The prompt emphasizes using *adjusted* distances (adjusted_d_long, adjusted_d_lat). However, these values are not provided in the scenario context.  Therefore, the analysis will use the provided real distances (DTClong, DTClat) as approximations.  This might lead to slightly less accurate risk assessments.
* **TTC Calculation:**  TTC will be calculated as DTClong / Vrel_long when applicable. Lateral TTC (TTClat) is less relevant in this scenario but will be qualitatively considered.
* **Collision Point:** The provided context uses a point-based collision model.  This assumes the vehicle's extents are already factored into the distance measurements.  If these are raw distances between closest points, the actual risk is higher.



### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 3511**
- Distance Risk reason:  At 4.4 seconds, DTClong and DTClat are both 0.00 m, indicating a collision (or overlap, given the point-based model) on the right side of the ego vehicle.
- Distance safety score: 0
- Time Risk reason: TTC is essentially zero, as the obstacle is already overlapping with the ego vehicle.
- Time safety score: 0
- Overall Risk score: 0

- **Obstacle ID: 3512**
- Distance Risk reason: DTClong is 7.17 m and DTClat is 7.17m, placing it relatively far from the ego vehicle.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Vrel_long is positive (moving away). No risk of longitudinal collision. Lateral motion presents no immediate concern.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 3513**
- Distance Risk reason:  Large DTClong (16.92 m) and DTClat (16.92 m).
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: While Vrel_long is slightly negative, the large distance and slow relative velocity indicate ample time to react.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 3515**
- Distance Risk reason: DTClong and DTClat are 0.00 m, signifying a collision on the right side of the ego vehicle.
- Distance safety score: 0
- Time Risk reason: TTC is effectively zero.
- Time safety score: 0
- Overall Risk score: 0

- **Obstacle ID: 3517**
- Distance Risk reason: DTClong is -0.61 m, indicating the obstacle is close behind and slightly overlapping.
- Distance safety score: 1
- Time Risk reason: The small negative distance and positive Vrel_long suggest an impending rear-end collision.
- Time safety score: 1
- Overall Risk score: 1

- **Obstacle ID: 3520**
- Distance Risk reason:  DTClong is -15.88 m, meaning it is significantly behind the ego vehicle.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason:  Although Vrel_long is positive (approaching from behind), the substantial distance provides adequate time to react.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5
