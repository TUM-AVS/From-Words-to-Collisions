* **Obstacle 3511**: This obstacle is to the right of the ego vehicle, with a longitudinal distance of 0.00m and a lateral distance of -21.15m.  The longitudinal velocity suggests obstacle and ego are on a converging course, though given the lateral distance, collision is unlikely.  The lateral velocity is negligible, confirming minimal lateral movement. This obstacle poses no immediate risk. Risk Level: 5 (Negligible Risk)

* **Obstacle 3512**: Located front-right, this obstacle shows a longitudinal distance of 7.17m and a lateral distance of -0.93m. The longitudinal velocity is positive (3.66 m/s), indicating the obstacle is moving away from the ego vehicle. The lateral velocity is negative (-0.36 m/s), indicating it is also moving away laterally. Therefore, the risk of collision is very low. Risk Level: 5 (Negligible Risk).

* **Obstacle 3513**: This obstacle is front-left, with longitudinal distance 16.92m and lateral distance 11.63m.  Both longitudinal and lateral velocities show the obstacle is moving away from the ego vehicle. Risk Level: 5 (Negligible Risk)

* **Obstacle 3515**: This obstacle is to the right of the ego vehicle and poses a potential risk. It has a longitudinal distance of 0.00m and a lateral distance of -13.75m. While it maintains a safe lateral distance, its longitudinal alignment with the ego vehicle raises concern. The negative longitudinal velocity (-5.85 m/s) suggests a potential lane change or other maneuver that brings the vehicles into longitudinal alignment, and should be monitored.  Risk Level: 4 (Low Risk) 

* **Obstacle 3517**:  This obstacle is behind the ego vehicle and approaching rapidly. It has a longitudinal distance of -0.61m and a lateral distance of 0.00m. The positive longitudinal velocity (1.75 m/s) indicates it is closing in fast. The lateral alignment is concerning as it suggests a rear-end collision is possible if the ego vehicle were to brake suddenly or the obstacle continues to accelerate. TTC is -0.61/1.75 = -0.35s, which, combined with the small MDC, indicates this obstacle recently passed the ego vehicle. Risk Level: 2 (High Risk)

* **Obstacle 3520**: Located behind the ego vehicle at a longitudinal distance of -15.88m and a lateral distance of 0.00m. The longitudinal velocity is 1.82 m/s indicating it is approaching. Given the larger longitudinal distance, it poses less immediate risk than Obstacle 3517. Risk Level: 4 (Low Risk).
