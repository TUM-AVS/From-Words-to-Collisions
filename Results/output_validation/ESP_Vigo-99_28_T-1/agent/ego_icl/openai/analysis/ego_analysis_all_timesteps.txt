### Obstacle-by-Obstacle Analysis:

#### Obstacle 3511:
- **Position & Motion**: The obstacle is mainly to the right of the ego vehicle with zero longitudinal distance, indicating side-by-side alignment but not collision unless lateral distance also zero.
- **Trajectory**: Moving laterally from the right, but primarily aligning along longitudinal axis recently.
- **Adjusted Distances**: Longitudinal 0.00 m, Lateral -21.15 m, velocity in longitudinal direction.
- **TTC & MDC**: 
  - Longitudinal (0.00 m) with velocity indicating longitudinal movement alignment.
  - Lateral distance is large, so no immediate lateral collision risk.
- **Risk Assessment**: Medium to high risk based on trajectory alignment and limited proximity, but not colliding currently. 

#### Obstacle 3512:
- **Position & Motion**: Positioned at the front-right, moving away longitudinally, approaching laterally.
- **Trajectory**: Consistent behavior in previous timesteps of moving laterally towards the ego.
- **Adjusted Distances**: Longitudinal 7.17 m, Lateral -0.93 m.
- **TTC & MDC**:
  - Longitudinal negligible risk as moving away.
  - Lateral TTC > 5s due to slow lateral closing velocity.
- **Risk Assessment**: Low to negligible risk, future alignment suggested stable.

#### Obstacle 3513:
- **Position & Motion**: Front-left with both dimensions increasing in the past; moving away in both.
- **Trajectory**: Consistent withdrawal in both dimensions.
- **Adjusted Distances**: Longitudinal 16.92 m, Lateral 11.63 m.
- **TTC & MDC**: Much greater than 5 seconds in both dimensions.
- **Risk Assessment**: Negligible risk, continuing to move away.

#### Obstacle 3515:
- **Position & Motion**: Restricted to the right, longitudinal zero, supporting side-by-side alignment.
- **Trajectory**: Repeated alignment along longitudinal axis with zero displacement.
- **Adjusted Distances**: Longitudinal 0.00 m, Lateral -13.75 m.
- **TTC & MDC**:
  - Longitudinal alignment but motion suggests continued side positioning.
  - No imminent collision across lattices.
- **Risk Assessment**: Medium risk, alignment highlight no collision imminence, potential future risk if trajectory becomes invasive.

#### Obstacle 3517:
- **Position & Motion**: Behind with weakly closing alignment longitudinally.
- **Trajectory**: Approaching linearly over recent steps.
- **Adjusted Distances**: Longitudinal -0.61 m, Lateral 0.00 m.
- **TTC & MDC**:
  - Longitudinal closing place to within 3m; lateral stable.
  - Approaching conditions, implying Medium to high risk score.
- **Risk Assessment**: Moderate risk, mitigation via evasive still possible.

#### Obstacle 3520:
- **Position & Motion**: Primarily at the rear aligning.
- **Trajectory**: Closing towards lateral alignment and longitudinally.
- **Adjusted Distances**: Longitudinal -15.88 m, Lateral 0.00 m.
- **TTC & MDC**:
  - Longitudinal moderate considering already close speeds.
  - Lateral stationary indicating no significant convergence.
- **Risk Assessment**: Medium to negligible risk, mostly aligned but at some distance.

### Conclusion

- Obstacle 3511 presents the highest potential risk due to close alignment and empty relative proximities despite not colliding momentarily.
- No current collisions in the most recent timestep, however straightening trajectories or close velocities...
- Continuing vigilance or minor directional alterations advised to prevent high-risk convergence (risk score "2").
