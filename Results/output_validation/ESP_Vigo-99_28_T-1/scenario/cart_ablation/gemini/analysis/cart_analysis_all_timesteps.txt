At t=4.6s, Ego (3514.0) is at (71.5256, -397.5121) in lanelet 2230.0. Let's analyze the closest obstacles:

* **Obstacle 3512.0:** Located at (59.2462, -400.6995) in lanelet 595.0.  While the y-coordinates are somewhat close, the x-coordinate difference suggests this obstacle is not an immediate threat. Given its trajectory and velocity (increasing at 9.5184 and accelerating at -0.3233), it appears to be moving away from Ego. Risk score: 3 (Medium Risk).

* **Obstacle 3517.0:** Located at (75.841, -395.4916) in the same lanelet 466.0. The x and y coordinates show proximity to the ego vehicle.  This obstacle is a potential threat. Risk score: 2 (High Risk).

* **Obstacle 3520.0:** Located at (89.738, -389.1643), also in lanelet 466.0, but further ahead of Ego.  Less of a risk than 3517.0.  Risk score: 4 (Low Risk)

No obstacles pose an immediate collision risk (score 0 or 1).
