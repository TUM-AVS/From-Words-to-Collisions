Obstacle 3512 is showing a concerning trajectory. While not an immediate collision risk at the current timestep (4.6 seconds), its rapid acceleration and changing orientation suggest a high risk of collision in the near future.  It has also changed lanelets, which may indicate erratic behavior. Obstacle 3517 is in the same lane as the ego vehicle and its position and velocity suggest a medium risk. It is approaching the ego vehicle and continued movement along the current trajectories may result in a closer interaction.

    "Reasoning": "No immediate collision, but obstacle 3512's trajectory and high acceleration require close monitoring. Obstacle 3517 poses a medium risk due to its proximity and velocity relative to the ego vehicle."
