### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. Ego is in lanelet 2230 at 4.6s, previously in 466
2. Obstacle 3517 is the closest in same lane (466) but behind ego
3. No obstacles are on direct collision course
4. All obstacles are either maintaining distance or moving away
5. No immediate collision risk exists
