- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Moving at similar speed as ego.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4
- Obstacle ID: 3520.0
- Distance Risk reason:  Ahead of ego in the same lanelet, but sufficiently far.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Moving at similar speed as ego.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
No obstacles pose an immediate collision risk. The ego vehicle is moving in lanelet 2230. Obstacles 3517 and 3520 are in the same lanelet (466) as the ego vehicle was initially but are sufficiently far away and traveling at similar speeds. Other obstacles are in different lanelets and pose no risk within the analyzed timeframe.  This is not a collision scenario.
