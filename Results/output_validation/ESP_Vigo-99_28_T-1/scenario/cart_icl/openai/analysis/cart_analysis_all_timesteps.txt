### Obstacle Analysis:

#### Obstacle 3511:
- **Distance Risk reason**: This obstacle is stationary with negligible velocity and is located away from the ego vehicle, consistently outside significant interaction ranges.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: With a velocity close to zero and no significant approach trajectory toward the ego vehicle during previous timesteps, the risk is minimal.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

#### Obstacle 3512:
- **Distance Risk reason**: This obstacle has a significant speed and is on a converging path with the ego vehicle's lanelet shift, but currently located further away on a different trajectory.
- **Distance safety score**: 3
- **Time Risk reason**: The obstacle's increasing velocity implies a potential collision course if its path isn't altered, though presently no immediate threat.
- **Time safety score**: 3
- **Overall Risk score**: 3

#### Obstacle 3513:
- **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle consistently tracks away from ego's current trajectory and is distant enough to not pose an immediate hazard.
- **Distance safety score**: 4
- **Time Risk reason**: Given the steady velocity and decreasing approach trend, its interaction with the ego vehicle is unlikely.
- **Time safety score**: 4
- **Overall Risk score**: 4

#### Obstacle 3515:
- **Distance Risk reason**: This obstacle is stationary and consistently outside of the ego vehicle's lane and trajectory over multiple timesteps.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: With no movement, it poses no dynamic risk over time.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

#### Obstacle 3517:
- **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is in the same lanelet and relatively close, but maintains a parallel movement without significant convergence toward the ego vehicle.
- **Distance safety score**: 2
- **Time Risk reason**: The steady speed and minimal acceleration imply a stable trajectory, yet close proximity necessitates caution.
- **Time safety score**: 3
- **Overall Risk score**: 3

#### Obstacle 3520:
- **Distance Risk reason**: Despite being in the same lane and moving parallel, it is well ahead of the ego and stable, reducing its immediate interactive risk.
- **Distance safety score**: 4
- **Time Risk reason**: Consistent velocity trends indicate stable trajectory alignment with minimal collision risk.
- **Time safety score**: 4
- **Overall Risk score**: 4

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
- **Collision scenario**: No obstacles observed with an overall risk score of 0.
- **Extreme risk scenario**: No obstacles have an extreme risk score.
- Both 3517 and 3512 are in close parameters but maintain controlled movement, lowering immediate collision risk.
