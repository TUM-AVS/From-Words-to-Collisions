Obstacle 3517 is behind the ego vehicle and poses a high risk.  At the most recent timestep (4.6 seconds), it is only 0.25 meters behind the ego and closing at 1.57 m/s. While the relative acceleration suggests the closing speed might decrease, the proximity and current velocity indicate a very high probability of collision in the immediate future.
