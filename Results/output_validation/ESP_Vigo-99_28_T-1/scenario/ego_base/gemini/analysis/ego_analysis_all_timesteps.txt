Obstacle 3517 is very close behind the ego vehicle (-0.25m) and approaching longitudinally.  While the relative longitudinal velocity is decreasing (1.57 m/s), the proximity suggests a high risk of collision in the immediate future.

**Risk Levels and Definitions:**
Collision (Score: 0): Actual collision has occurred or is unavoidable within the next timestep.
Extreme Risk (Score: 1): Immediate collision or very high likelihood of impact. Urgent action is required.
High Risk (Score: 2): Close to collision or highly probable collision path. Needs prompt attention and quick manoeuvring.
Medium Risk (Score: 3): Moderate collision risk but manageable with timely reactions and proper strategies.
Low Risk (Score: 4): Minimal collision risk. The situation is controllable with sufficient time to react.
Negligible Risk (Score: 5): No significant collision risk. Obstacles are either moving away or far enough not to interfere.
