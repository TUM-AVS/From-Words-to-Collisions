### Safety analysis for timestep 4.6 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

It's crucial to note that the provided scenario lacks adjusted distances (adjusted_d_long and adjusted_d_lat).  As instructed, these adjusted values are essential for accurate risk assessment.  Because they are missing, the analysis below will use the raw longitudinal and lateral distances, recognizing that this introduces potential inaccuracies.  **The requestor should provide adjusted distances for a truly reliable safety analysis.**

Also, the method for calculating TTC is not specified. I will assume the simplest calculation: `TTC = Distance / Relative Velocity`. This doesn't account for acceleration, and a more sophisticated approach would improve accuracy.



### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 3511**
- Distance Risk reason:  Zero distance longitudinally and laterally, in the Right of the ego car indicates a collision.
- Distance safety score: 0
- Time Risk reason: Collision already occurred.
- Time safety score: 0
- Overall Risk score: 0

- **Obstacle ID: 3512**
- Distance Risk reason: Located Front-right with 7.87m distance in both directions.  Poses no immediate risk.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Moving away longitudinally. Laterally moving towards ego vehicle, but distance is sufficient.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 3513**
- Distance Risk reason: Located Front-left at a safe distance (17.01m).
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Moving away laterally, and although moving slightly towards the ego car longitudinally, the distance and relative velocity are low.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 3515**
- Distance Risk reason: Zero distance longitudinally and laterally, in the Right of the ego car indicates a collision.
- Distance safety score: 0
- Time Risk reason: Collision already occurred.
- Time safety score: 0
- Overall Risk score: 0

- **Obstacle ID: 3517**
- Distance Risk reason:  Very close behind the ego vehicle (-0.25m). Highly dangerous.
- Distance safety score: 1
- Time Risk reason:  Closing rapidly from behind.
- Time safety score: 1
- Overall Risk score: 1

- **Obstacle ID: 3520**
- Distance Risk reason:  Located behind the ego car at a relatively safe distance (-15.51m).
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Driving towards the ego car from behind, but distance and velocity indicate time to react.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4
