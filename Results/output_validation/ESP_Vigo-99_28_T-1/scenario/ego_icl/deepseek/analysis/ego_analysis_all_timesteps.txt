Let me analyze the most recent timestep (4.6 seconds) for collision risks:

Obstacle 3511:
- Position: Right side (longitudinal 0.00m, lateral -21.16m)
- Motion: Exact longitudinal alignment, moving toward laterally from right
- Relative velocity: longitudinal -6.07 m/s (away), lateral 0.00 m/s (stable)
- Analysis: Large lateral distance (21.16m) with no lateral movement. No collision risk.
- Risk: 5 (No Risk)

Obstacle 3512:
- Position: Front-right (longitudinal 7.87m, lateral -1.17m)
- Motion: Moving away longitudinally and laterally to right
- Relative velocity: longitudinal 3.43 m/s (away), lateral -0.62 m/s (away)
- Analysis: Both distances increasing. No collision risk.
- Risk: 5 (No Risk)

Obstacle 3513:
- Position: Front-left (longitudinal 17.01m, lateral 12.35m)
- Motion: Moving toward longitudinally but away laterally
- Relative velocity: longitudinal -0.53 m/s (closing), lateral 4.74 m/s (away)
- Analysis: Large distances with slow longitudinal approach. No collision risk.
- Risk: 5 (No Risk)

Obstacle 3515:
- Position: Right side (longitudinal 0.00m, lateral -13.77m)
- Motion: Exact longitudinal alignment, no lateral movement
- Relative velocity: longitudinal -6.07 m/s (away), lateral 0.00 m/s
- Analysis: Large stable lateral distance. No collision risk.
- Risk: 5 (No Risk)

Obstacle 3517:
- Position: Behind (longitudinal -0.25m, lateral 0.00m)
- Motion: Approaching from behind with exact lateral alignment
- Relative velocity: longitudinal 1.57 m/s (closing), lateral -0.26 m/s
- TTC: 0.25m / 1.57 m/s = 0.16 seconds (Extreme Risk)
- MDC: 0.25m (Extreme Risk)
- Analysis: Very close distance with high closing speed from behind. Extreme collision risk.
- Risk: 1 (Extreme Risk)

Obstacle 3520:
- Position: Behind (longitudinal -15.51m, lateral 0.00m)
- Motion: Approaching from behind with exact lateral alignment
- Relative velocity: longitudinal 1.58 m/s (closing)
- TTC: 15.51m / 1.58 m/s = 9.82 seconds
- Analysis: Large distance with slow approach. No immediate risk.
- Risk: 5 (No Risk)

Trajectory Analysis:
- Obstacle 3517 shows consistent approach from behind over multiple timesteps:
  - 4.3s: -0.82m
  - 4.4s: -0.61m
  - 4.5s: -0.43m
  - 4.6s: -0.25m
- Closing speed remains consistently around 1.5-2.0 m/s
- Will reach collision point (0m) within next 0.2 seconds if trajectories continue

Conclusion:
This is a collision scenario due to Obstacle 3517's extreme risk position directly behind the ego vehicle with imminent collision.

    "IsCollisionScenario": true,
    "Justification": "Obstacle 3517 is approaching from directly behind with only 0.25m distance and 1.57 m/s closing speed (TTC=0.16s), creating extreme collision risk. Collision is imminent if trajectories continue."
