### Obstacle Analysis

#### Obstacle 3511:
- **Direction:** Right of the ego car
- **Adjusted Distances:** Longitudinal 0.00 m, Lateral -21.16 m
- **Relative Velocity:** Longitudinal -6.07 m/s, Lateral 0.00 m/s
- **Trajectory Overview:** This obstacle shows a consistent trajectory towards a side alignment. It maintains a considerable lateral distance with no significant risk of side collision.
- **Calculations:**
  - **MDC (Longitudinal):** 0 meters (indicating proximity but not necessarily a collision based on lateral distance)
  - **TTC:** Not applicable as it remains at exact longitudinal alignment without real closing in lateral distance.
- **Assessment:** Due to persistent large lateral distance and stable longitudinal alignment, this is a low risk scenario for collision, leading to no reasonable path of collision.
  
#### Obstacle 3512:
- **Direction:** Front-right
- **Adjusted Distances:** Longitudinal 7.87 m, Lateral -1.17 m
- **Relative Velocity:** Longitudinal 3.43 m/s (moving away), Lateral -0.62 m/s
- **Trajectory Overview:** This obstacle is moving away longitudinally and laterally, indicating diverging paths.
- **Calculations:**
  - **MDC:** 6.42 meters (based on front-right trajectory)
  - **TTC (longitudinal):** Not applicable as it moves away
  - **TTC (lateral):** â‰ˆ 1.88 seconds (1.17 m / 0.62 m/s)
- **Assessment:** No Risk. Obstacle moves away from the ego vehicle over time in both directions.

#### Obstacle 3513:
- **Direction:** Front-left
- **Adjusted Distances:** Longitudinal 17.01 m, Lateral 12.35 m
- **Relative Velocity:** Longitudinal -0.53 m/s, Lateral 4.74 m/s
- **Trajectory Overview:** It's moving away laterally and significantly ahead longitudinally.
- **Calculations:**
  - **MDC:** 12.35 meters
  - **TTC:** No immediate closing detected; negligible risk.
- **Assessment:** No Risk. The obstacle trajectory shows continued divergence.

#### Obstacle 3515:
- **Direction:** Right of the ego car
- **Adjusted Distances:** Longitudinal 0.00 m, Lateral -13.77 m
- **Relative Velocity:** Longitudinal -6.07 m/s
- **Trajectory Overview:** This obstacle has exact longitudinal alignment with maintained lateral distance, similar to obstacle 3511.
- **Calculations:**
  - **MDC (Longitudinal):** 0 meters, no collision trajectory laterally
  - **TTC:** Not applicable as lateral distance is large.
- **Assessment:** Low risk due to persistent longitudinal alignment without lateral proximity threat.

#### Obstacle 3517:
- **Direction:** Behind
- **Adjusted Distances:** Longitudinal -0.25 m, Lateral 0.00 m
- **Relative Velocity:** Longitudinal 1.57 m/s
- **Trajectory Overview:** Continually approaching from behind, but speed differential is not significant enough to close an already negative distance rapidly.
- **Calculations:**
  - **MDC:** -0.25 meters (not an immediate threat given backward positioning)
  - **TTC:** Immediate risk based on close proximity and continuous approach
- **Assessment:** High Risk. Given closeness, this obstacle suggests possible converging path requiring monitoring.

#### Obstacle 3520:
- **Direction:** Behind
- **Adjusted Distances:** Longitudinal -15.51 m, Lateral 0.00 m
- **Relative Velocity:** Longitudinal 1.58 m/s
- **Trajectory Overview:** Approaching from behind but with substantial remaining distance.
- **Calculations:**
  - **MDC:** -15.51 meters, reflecting a low risk due to large approach distance.
  - **TTC (Longitudinal):** Approximately 9.82 seconds (15.51 m / 1.58 m/s), outside immediate concern window
- **Assessment:** No Risk. The rapid approach requires observation yet the large distance offers safety margins.

### Conclusion and Collision Scenario Evaluation

Among all obstacles, none show a longitudinal-lateral convergence suggesting imminent collision. Obstacle 3517 presents the highest concern due to close proximity from behind, classified as High Risk. No obstacles show extreme risk or certain convergence for collision within immediate timeframe. Overall, this is not marked as a collision scenario based on current assessment.
