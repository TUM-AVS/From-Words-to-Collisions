### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
    - Obstacle ID: 3511
    - Relative Direction: Right
    - Distance Risk Reason: DTClat is large (safe), DTClong is 0 indicating a collision risk. The obstacle has been approaching longitudinally and has now reached the same longitudinal position as the ego vehicle.
    - Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 0
    - Lateral Distance Safety Score: 5
    - Overall Distance Safety Score: 5.0
    - Time Risk Reason: TTClat is large (safe), TTClong is 0, indicating collision. This aligns with the DTClong indicating a current collision.
    - Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 0
    - Lateral Time Safety Score: 5
    - Overall Time Safety Score: 5.0
    - Overall Risk Score: 5

    - Obstacle ID: 3512
    - Relative Direction: Front-right
    - Distance Risk Reason:  DTClong > 5 and DTClat < 0.5, indicating a safe longitudinal distance but extreme lateral risk.  The obstacle has been consistently moving away longitudinally while approaching laterally.
    - Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 5
    - Lateral Distance Safety Score: 1
    - Overall Distance Safety Score: 3.0
    - Time Risk Reason: TTClong is inf (safe), TTClat > 5, so the lateral time to collision was initially low but has now become safer as the obstacle moves away.
    - Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 5
    - Lateral Time Safety Score: 5
    - Overall Time Safety Score: 5.0
    - Overall Risk Score: 4

    - Obstacle ID: 3513
    - Relative Direction: Front-left
    - Distance Risk Reason: Both DTClong and DTClat are > 5, indicating no risk. The obstacle has been moving away in both directions.
    - Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 5
    - Lateral Distance Safety Score: 5
    - Overall Distance Safety Score: 5.0
    - Time Risk Reason: Both TTClong and TTClat are large and increase over time, confirming the decreasing risk from this obstacle.
    - Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 5
    - Lateral Time Safety Score: 5
    - Overall Time Safety Score: 5.0
    - Overall Risk Score: 5

    - Obstacle ID: 3515
    - Relative Direction: Right
    - Distance Risk Reason: DTClong is 0 and DTClat is large, indicating a collision risk longitudinally but safe laterally. The obstacle has approached longitudinally and reached the same longitudinal position as the ego vehicle.
    - Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 0
    - Lateral Distance Safety Score: 5
    - Overall Distance Safety Score: 5.0
    - Time Risk Reason: TTClong is 0 and TTClat is inf, meaning a collision is occurring longitudinally while there is no lateral risk. This is consistent with the distance metrics.
    - Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 0
    - Lateral Time Safety Score: 5
    - Overall Time Safety Score: 5.0
    - Overall Risk Score: 5

    - Obstacle ID: 3517
    - Relative Direction: Behind
    - Distance Risk Reason: DTClong is < 0.5, indicating extreme risk; DTClat is 0. This suggests a potential collision from behind. The obstacle has been approaching longitudinally and remains laterally aligned with the ego vehicle.
    - Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 1
    - Lateral Distance Safety Score: 0
    - Overall Distance Safety Score: 1.0
    - Time Risk Reason: TTClong < 0.5 and TTClat is 0.  The obstacle is predicted to collide with the ego vehicle very soon.
    - Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 1
    - Lateral Time Safety Score: 0
    - Overall Time Safety Score: 1.0
    - Overall Risk Score: 1

    - Obstacle ID: 3520
    - Relative Direction: Behind
    - Distance Risk Reason: DTClong is < -5 (far behind) and DTClat is 0. This indicates no immediate risk, but the lateral alignment needs monitoring. The obstacle has been approaching from behind but remains far enough away longitudinally.
    - Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 5
    - Lateral Distance Safety Score: 0
    - Overall Distance Safety Score: 5.0
    - Time Risk Reason: TTClong > 5 and TTClat is 0, confirming the low risk from a longitudinal perspective while the lateral motion is undetermined or aligned.
    - Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 5
    - Lateral Time Safety Score: 0
    - Overall Time Safety Score: 5.0
    - Overall Risk Score: 5
