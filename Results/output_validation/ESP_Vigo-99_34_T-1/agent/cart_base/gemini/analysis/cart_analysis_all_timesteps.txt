Obstacle 3520 is moving longitudinally away from the ego vehicle, posing no collision risk. Obstacle 3523 is also moving longitudinally, but its lateral distance to the ego vehicle is decreasing slightly over the provided timesteps. However, the lateral distance remains significant enough that a collision is not imminent or highly likely within the predicted timeframe.  The ego vehicle is also decelerating considerably. Therefore, neither obstacle presents a high or extreme risk of collision.
