At timestep 13.8s, ego vehicle's velocity is decreasing while both obstacles maintain a relatively constant velocity.

Obstacle 3520 is moving further away longitudinally from the ego vehicle, posing less of a risk.  Obstacle 3523, although somewhat further away than 3520, is moving closer longitudinally to the ego vehicle.  Given that both vehicles have similar y-coordinates and the ego vehicle's velocity is decreasing, this obstacle requires monitoring. Both Obstacles are assessed at risk level 4 or 5.
