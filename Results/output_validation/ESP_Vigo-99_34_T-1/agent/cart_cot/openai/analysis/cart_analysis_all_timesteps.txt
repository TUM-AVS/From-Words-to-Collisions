### Analysis:

At the most recent timestep (13.8 seconds), we observe the following:

1. **Ego Vehicle (3521.0)**:
   - **Position**: (39.0383, -463.5951)
   - **Velocity**: 0.574 (still decelerating)
   - **Trend**: The ego vehicle is moving slowly and decelerating further, suggesting it's likely preparing to stop or steer to avoid a collision.

2. **Obstacle 3520.0**:
   - **Position**: (29.9163, -485.6514)
   - **Velocity**: 7.2862
   - **Trend**: The obstacle is moving significantly faster than the ego vehicle. Given its southern trajectory in a parallel lanelet, it poses less immediate threat. The relative distance is increasing, reducing direct collision risk in the short term.

3. **Obstacle 3523.0**:
   - **Position**: (41.5433, -458.1905)
   - **Velocity**: 7.3511
   - **Trend**: Moving quickly and roughly parallel or slightly diverging from the ego vehicle pathwise. Based on its more northern position compared to the ego vehicle, it might intersect or pass at an angle. Itâ€™s crucial to monitor the angular change and lateral displacement to predict potential future paths.

**Risk Assessment**:
- **Obstacle 3520.0**: This obstacle isn't on a collision course given its trajectory parallel and separate from the ego vehicle path, requiring only routine monitoring. It imposes a negligible immediate risk.
- **Obstacle 3523.0**: The rapid motion and relative closeness of this obstacle demand vigilance. However, given its motion appears either parallel or diverging, it isn't currently on a clear intercept path, placing it at a **medium risk** given the speed differential.

No obstacle is an imminent collision threat (score 0 or 1). However, continuous monitoring is crucial to ensure Ego vehicle's safety should trajectory paths change unpredictably.
