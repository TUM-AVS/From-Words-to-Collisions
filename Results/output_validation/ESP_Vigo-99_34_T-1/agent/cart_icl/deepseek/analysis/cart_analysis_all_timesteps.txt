### Analysis:

1. **Obstacle 3520.0**:
   - **Position**: (29.9163, -485.6514) at 13.8s, moving away from ego.
   - **Velocity**: 7.2862 m/s, decelerating (-0.7148 m/s²).
   - **Relative Motion**: The obstacle is behind the ego and moving away. The lateral distance is significant, and the longitudinal distance is increasing.
   - **TTC**: Not applicable (increasing distance).
   - **Risk**: **Negligible (5)**.

2. **Obstacle 3523.0**:
   - **Position**: (41.5433, -458.1905) at 13.8s, moving away from ego.
   - **Velocity**: 7.3511 m/s, accelerating (0.4115 m/s²).
   - **Relative Motion**: The obstacle is ahead of the ego and moving away. The lateral distance is significant, and the longitudinal distance is increasing.
   - **TTC**: Not applicable (increasing distance).
   - **Risk**: **Negligible (5)**.

3. **Ego Vehicle**:
   - **Position**: (39.0383, -463.5951) at 13.8s, decelerating (-0.3286 m/s²).
   - **Velocity**: 0.574 m/s, very slow.
   - **Relative Motion**: Both obstacles are moving away, and the ego is slowing down. No immediate collision risk.

### Conclusion:
- No obstacles pose a collision or extreme risk. All obstacles are moving away from the ego vehicle, and the ego is decelerating.
