At timestep 13.8s, Obstacle 3520 is behind the ego vehicle and moving faster, with a decreasing trend in acceleration. Obstacle 3523 is ahead of the ego vehicle and also moving faster, but there is a larger lateral distance. The ego vehicle is decelerating.

Calculations for Obstacle 3520 (at 13.8s):
- Ego position: (39.0383, -463.5951)
- Obstacle 3520 position: (29.9163, -485.6514)
- Longitudinal distance: 29.9163 - 39.0383 = -9.122m (behind ego)
- Lateral distance: |-485.6514 - (-463.5951)| = 22.0563m
- Ego velocity: 0.574 m/s
- Obstacle 3520 velocity: 7.2862 m/s
- Relative velocity: 7.2862 - 0.574 = 6.7122 m/s
- TTC: -9.122 / 6.7122 ≈ -1.36s (negative TTC indicates overtaking from behind)

Calculations for Obstacle 3523 (at 13.8s):
- Ego position: (39.0383, -463.5951)
- Obstacle 3523 position: (41.5433, -458.1905)
- Longitudinal distance: 41.5433 - 39.0383 = 2.505m (ahead of ego)
- Lateral distance: |-458.1905 - (-463.5951)| = 5.4046m
- Ego velocity: 0.574 m/s
- Obstacle 3523 velocity: 7.3511 m/s
- Relative velocity: 7.3511 - 0.574 = 6.7771 m/s
- TTC: 2.505 / 6.7771 ≈ 0.37s

Risk Assessment:

Obstacle 3520: Medium Risk (3). While the TTC is negative, indicating an overtake from behind, the substantial lateral distance suggests a manageable risk. The risk level is increased due to the continued closing velocity, even if the overtake is from behind.

Obstacle 3523: High Risk (2). The TTC is relatively low (0.37s) and although there is some lateral distance, the continuous closing velocity indicates a potentially dangerous situation. Requires attention and a driver/system response.
