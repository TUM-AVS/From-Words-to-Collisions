To evaluate the scenario and potential collision risks, it is important to analyze each obstacle's trajectory relative to the Ego vehicle and identify any significant risks at the latest timestep (13.8 seconds). 

### Analysis

1. **Ego Vehicle (ID: 3521.0)**
   - Position: (39.0383, -463.5951)
   - Velocity: 0.574 m/s (decelerating)
   - Orientation change indicates a slight correction of path over time.

2. **Obstacle 3520.0**
   - Position at 13.8s: (29.9163, -485.6514)
   - Velocity: 7.2862 m/s
   - Relative position to Ego: approximately 22.06 m behind in the same lanelet.
   - The obstacle is moving towards the Ego while the Ego is decelerating more quickly, but it seems to be maintaining a safe longitudinal separation.
   - **Risk**: Based on distance and trend, this fits a **Negligible Risk (5)**.

3. **Obstacle 3523.0**
   - Position at 13.8s: (41.5433, -458.1905)
   - Velocity: 7.3511 m/s
   - Relative position to Ego: approximately 5.4 m ahead but laterally separated.
   - The obstacle is consistently ahead and moving faster than the Ego, with growing lateral spacing, reducing immediate collision likelihood.
   - **Risk**: Due to lateral separation, this also fits into a **Negligible Risk (5)**.

### Conclusion

At the analyzed timestep, no obstacle is positioned such that it poses an immediate collision risk or extreme risk scenario. The closest obstacle, 3523.0, is ahead and laterally separated, and obstacle 3520.0, while behind and moving faster, still maintains a significant spatial buffer.
