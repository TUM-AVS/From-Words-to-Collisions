### Safety analysis for timestep 13.8s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

**Assumptions and Calculations:**

Since the provided context lacks information about ego vehicle and obstacle dimensions, I'll make some assumptions for demonstration.  I will assume both the ego vehicle and obstacle are roughly 2 meters wide and 4 meters long.  Therefore, I will subtract 1 meter from the absolute longitudinal and lateral distances to account for vehicle size, to obtain adjusted distances.

For obstacle 3523, which is behind the ego vehicle, I will treat the negative longitudinal distance as positive when calculating TTC and MDC. I will also infer TTC based on the closing rate, since constant velocity is implied with the lack of acceleration information.


**Obstacle Analysis:**

- **Obstacle ID: 3520**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 3520 is in front of the ego vehicle, with adjusted_d_long = 18.34m and adjusted_d_lat = 18.34m. This large distance signifies no immediate risk.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: The obstacle is moving away from the ego vehicle longitudinally (Vrel_long = 6.69 m/s).  The large distance and separating velocity indicate no risk of collision.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 3523**
- Distance Risk reason: This obstacle is behind the ego vehicle and approaching. adjusted_d_long = 0.45m,  adjusted_d_lat = 0.45m. The small distance indicates extreme risk.
- Distance safety score: 1
- Time Risk reason: The obstacle is rapidly closing in longitudinally (Vrel_long = 6.78 m/s) at a very close distance, posing a serious and immediate collision risk.  With a relative velocity of 6.78m/s and a distance of 0.45m the TTC is approximately 0.07 seconds.
- Time safety score: 1
- Overall Risk score: 1
