### Analysis for Most Recent Timestep (13.8 seconds):

#### Obstacle 3520 (Front):
- **Adjusted Distance**: Longitudinal 19.34 m, Lateral 0.00 m
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal 6.69 m/s (moving away), Lateral 0.58 m/s (moving away)
- **Motion**: Moving away longitudinally and laterally.
- **TTC**: Not applicable (relative velocity is negative in both dimensions, meaning the obstacle is moving away).
- **MDC**: 19.34 m (longitudinal) and 0.00 m (lateral). Since the obstacle is moving away, the MDC is effectively infinite.
- **Risk Assessment**: 
  - Longitudinal: No Risk (5)
  - Lateral: No Risk (5)
  - **Overall Risk**: Negligible Risk (5)

#### Obstacle 3523 (Behind):
- **Adjusted Distance**: Longitudinal -1.45 m, Lateral 0.00 m
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal 6.78 m/s (approaching), Lateral -0.04 m/s (negligible)
- **Motion**: Driving toward the ego car from behind.
- **TTC**: 
  - Longitudinal: 1.45 m / 6.78 m/s â‰ˆ 0.21 seconds (Extreme Risk, 1)
  - Lateral: Not applicable (negligible relative velocity).
- **MDC**: 
  - Longitudinal: 1.45 m (High Risk, 2)
  - Lateral: 0.00 m (but not closing, so no immediate risk).
- **Risk Assessment**: 
  - Longitudinal: Extreme Risk (1) due to very low TTC.
  - Lateral: No Risk (5).
  - **Overall Risk**: Extreme Risk (1) (prioritize the higher risk assessment).

### Trajectory Analysis:
- **Obstacle 3520**: Consistently moving away from the ego vehicle in both longitudinal and lateral directions. No risk of collision.
- **Obstacle 3523**: Consistently approaching the ego vehicle from behind with increasing relative velocity. The TTC is very low (0.21 seconds), indicating an imminent collision risk.

### Notes:
- There is no current collision (risk score 0), but Obstacle 3523 poses an extreme risk (risk score 1) due to its very low TTC and rapid approach from behind.
- Obstacle 3520 is not a concern as it is moving away from the ego vehicle.
- The predicted collision obstacle is 3523, given its current trajectory and velocity.
