At t=14.0s, Ego (3521.0) is slowing down significantly (v=0.4303, a=-0.3802) in lanelet 1315.0.

Obstacle 3520.0 is moving considerably faster (v=7.2906) and further behind Ego. While its trajectory shows some fluctuation in acceleration, the large velocity difference and distance suggest low risk currently.

Obstacle 3523.0 is also moving much faster (v=7.3003) than Ego, but it's ahead of Ego and also in the same lanelet. While the velocity difference is large, the closing distance and the fact that both are in the same lanelet requires closer attention.  However, given the current positions and velocities, an immediate collision is not imminent, making this a higher risk (but not extreme).

    "Reasoning": "No immediate collisions detected.  Obstacle 3523.0 warrants monitoring due to same lanelet occupancy and significant speed differential, but poses a medium risk at t=14.0s"
  }
