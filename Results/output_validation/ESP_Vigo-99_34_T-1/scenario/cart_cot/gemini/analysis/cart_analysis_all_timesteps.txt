### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 3520.0
- Distance Risk reason:  This obstacle is behind the ego vehicle and moving further away over time.  At t=14.0s, it's approximately 24 meters behind and slightly to the right. The historical data shows a consistent trend of increasing distance.  The orientations are similar, indicating both vehicles are headed in roughly the same direction within the same lanelet.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: The obstacle's velocity is significantly higher than the ego vehicle's, but it is moving away. While the obstacle's acceleration fluctuates, the overall trend in the distances between the two vehicles indicates no risk of collision.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 3523.0
- Distance Risk reason: This obstacle is ahead of the ego vehicle, but the distance is increasing over time. At t=14.0s, it's approximately 16 meters ahead. The historical data shows a consistent trend of increasing distance between the vehicles. Orientations are very similar suggesting they are traveling in the same direction.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: This obstacle's velocity is significantly higher than the ego vehicle's, and it's moving away. While the obstacle's acceleration fluctuates, the distances clearly show separation is increasing.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5


### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. **Most critical obstacles:**  Initially, both obstacles 3520.0 and 3523.0 warranted attention due to their proximity to the ego vehicle.
2. **Trajectory analysis (10 timesteps):**  Over the ten timesteps, obstacle 3520.0 consistently moved further behind the ego vehicle. Obstacle 3523.0 consistently moved further ahead of the ego vehicle.
3. **Relative position, velocity, and acceleration:**  Obstacle 3520.0 remained behind the ego vehicle with a higher velocity but was moving away. Obstacle 3523.0 remained ahead of the ego vehicle with a higher velocity but was moving away. The accelerations of both obstacles fluctuated but didn't indicate a risk of collision given the overall trajectory trends.
4. **Collision determination:**  No collision occurred or is imminent. Both obstacles are moving away from the ego vehicle.
5. **Reasoning:**  The continuous increase in distance between the ego vehicle and both obstacles over the ten timesteps, coupled with their similar orientations within the same lanelet, strongly indicates no collision risk.
