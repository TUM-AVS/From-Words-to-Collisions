### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 3520.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 3520.0 is behind the ego vehicle and moving away. The distance between them has been increasing over the past several timesteps.  Positions and orientations suggest no immediate risk.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: The relative velocity indicates divergence. Acceleration values also point to continued separation.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 3523.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 3523.0 is ahead of the ego vehicle, but at a safe distance. While the ego vehicle is decelerating more rapidly, the distance remains substantial.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: The relative velocities and accelerations indicate the gap between the vehicles may decrease, but not critically in the short term. Further monitoring needed.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
This is not a collision scenario. Neither obstacle poses an immediate collision risk. Obstacle 3520.0 is moving away from the ego vehicle. Obstacle 3523.0 is ahead and at a safe distance, though further monitoring is recommended as the ego vehicle decelerates.
