### Obstacle Analysis at 14.0 Seconds:

#### Obstacle ID: 3520.0
- **Distance Risk Reason:** 
  - The obstacle is located in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle but is moving further away in the negative Y direction. The initial distance from the ego vehicle was about 23.8 units and increased consistently due to its higher velocity.
- **Distance Safety Score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)
- **Time Risk Reason:** 
  - With a consistent velocity over the past time steps, the obstacle has been moving away from the ego vehicle. Given the velocity difference, there's a significant time to collision when extrapolated.
- **Time Safety Score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)
- **Overall Risk Score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)

#### Obstacle ID: 3523.0
- **Distance Risk Reason:** 
  - This obstacle is also in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle but stays consistently ahead with a position Y approximately 5 units higher. Given the trajectory, there's little chance of a crossing path.
- **Distance Safety Score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)
- **Time Risk Reason:** 
  - The obstacle has maintained a high and stable velocity with minor fluctuations. There is little change in trajectory or acceleration, leading to sufficient separation from the ego vehicle.
- **Time Safety Score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)
- **Overall Risk Score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
- **Step-by-Step:**
  1. Evaluate initial and final positions of all obstacles relative to the ego vehicle.
  2. Assess the change in distance over the measured intervals.
  3. Consider the velocity and acceleration trends to determine any approach or retreat from the ego vehicle.
  4. Determine the time to collision (TTC) based on remaining distances and relative velocities. 

- **Conclusion:**
  - Both obstacles show negligible risk as they generally move away from or maintain a safe distance from the ego vehicle.
  - No obstacles exhibit collision patterns, hence no immediate or future collision risk is observed.
  - As such, this is not a collision scenario.
