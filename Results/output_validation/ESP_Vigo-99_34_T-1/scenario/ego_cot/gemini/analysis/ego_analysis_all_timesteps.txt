### Safety analysis for timestep 13.1-14.0: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

**Calculations and Assumptions:**

* **TTC Longitudinal (TTClong):** -DTClong / Vrel_long  (If Vrel_long is positive, meaning the obstacle is moving away, TTClong is considered infinite and safe).
* **TTC Lateral (TTClat):** -DTClat / Vrel_lat (If Vrel_lat is close to zero or the sign indicates lateral movement away from the ego vehicle, TTClat is considered infinite and safe).
* **MDC:** For simplification, we consider MDC as the minimum of DTClong and DTClat over the given time steps.  A more accurate assessment would involve calculating the closest point of approach considering both longitudinal and lateral movement simultaneously.

Since "Exact lateral alignment or unknown case" is stated for each obstacle, I assume DTClong and DTClat are equal, and the lateral movement can be negligible due to the small Vrel_lat. Consequently, TTClat is also not the dominant factor. The primary concern is the longitudinal movement of Obstacle 3523.


### Obstacle Analysis:

**- Obstacle ID: 3520**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 3520 is in front of the ego vehicle and moving away. DTClong increases over time.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Obstacle 3520 is moving away from the ego vehicle (positive Vrel_long).
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

**- Obstacle ID: 3523**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 3523 is behind the ego vehicle and approaching rapidly. DTClong decreases to almost zero.
- Distance safety score: 1
- Time Risk reason: Obstacle 3523 is closing in from behind, and TTClong is very short, reaching near zero within the analyzed timeframe.
- Time safety score: 1
- Overall Risk score: 1


### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
  "CollisionObstacle": null,
  "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {
    "ObstacleID": "3523",
    "OverallRiskScore": "1"
  },
  "IsCollisionScenario": false,
  "Justification": "Obstacle 3523 poses an extreme risk due to very low DTClong and TTClong, indicating a near-collision situation from behind.  While the data doesn't explicitly show a collision (DTClong doesn't reach exactly 0 in provided data), the trend clearly indicates an impending collision if no evasive action is taken. Obstacle 3520 presents no risk as it is moving away from the ego vehicle."
