### Obstacle-by-Obstacle Analysis

#### Obstacle 3520 (Front of ego car)
- **Latest Timestep (14.0s)**:
  - **Adjusted Distance**: Longitudinal 20.68 m, Lateral 0.00 m
  - **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal 6.83 m/s (moving away), Lateral 0.64 m/s (moving away)
  - **Motion**: Moving away longitudinally, exact lateral alignment.
  - **Trajectory Analysis**:
    - Longitudinal distance increases from 14.99 m to 20.68 m over 0.9s (consistent positive relative velocity).
    - Lateral distance remains 0.00 m but lateral velocity is positive (0.64 m/s), indicating slight divergence.
  - **TTC**: Not applicable (relative velocity is negative in both dimensions, meaning paths are diverging).
  - **MDC**: Current longitudinal distance is 20.68 m (No Risk, MDC > 5.0 m).
  - **Overall Risk**: 5 (No Risk).

#### Obstacle 3523 (Behind ego car)
- **Latest Timestep (14.0s)**:
  - **Adjusted Distance**: Longitudinal -0.10 m, Lateral 0.00 m
  - **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal 6.87 m/s (approaching), Lateral -0.03 m/s (negligible).
  - **Motion**: Driving toward ego car from behind, exact lateral alignment.
  - **Trajectory Analysis**:
    - Longitudinal distance decreases from -5.85 m to -0.10 m over 0.9s (consistent positive relative velocity).
    - Lateral distance remains 0.00 m with negligible lateral velocity (-0.03 m/s).
  - **TTC**:
    - Longitudinal TTC = 0.10 m / 6.87 m/s ≈ 0.0146 s (Extreme Risk, TTC ≤ 0.5 s).
  - **MDC**:
    - Current longitudinal distance is 0.10 m (Extreme Risk, MDC ≤ 0.5 m).
  - **Overall Risk**: 1 (Extreme Risk).

### Collision Scenario Determination
- Obstacle 3523 is at Extreme Risk (Overall Risk Score = 1) due to:
  - Very small longitudinal distance (0.10 m) with high closing velocity (6.87 m/s).
  - TTC is extremely low (0.0146 s), indicating imminent collision.
  - Lateral alignment is exact (0.00 m), meaning the obstacle is directly behind the ego vehicle.
