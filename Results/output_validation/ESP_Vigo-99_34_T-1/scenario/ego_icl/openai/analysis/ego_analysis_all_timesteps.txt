### Obstacle-by-Obstacle Analysis

#### Obstacle 3520:

**Trajectory Analysis:**
- Location: Front
- Longitudinal distance consistently increasing from 13.1s to 14.0s.
- Longitudinal relative velocity: Increasing positive values, indicating the obstacle is moving away.
- Motion description confirms the obstacle is moving away longitudinally.

**TTC and MDC Calculations at 14.0s:**
- **Adjusted Distance Analysis**: Since obstacle 3520 is moving away with no lateral offset, only longitudinal distance is relevant.
- **TTC**: Not applicable as the obstacle is moving away.
- **MDC**: Not relevant as the obstacle distance is increasing beyond 5m.

**Risk Assessment:**
- **Proximity and Trajectory**: The risk level is "No Risk" due to movement away and increasing distance beyond 15 meters.

#### Obstacle 3523:

**Trajectory Analysis:**
- Location: Behind
- Longitudinal distance rapidly decreasing from 13.1s (-5.85m) to 14.0s (-0.10m).
- Lateral position remains aligned (0.00m) indicating same lane.
- Longitudinal relative velocity: Positive values indicate the obstacle is approaching from behind.

**TTC and MDC Calculations at 14.0s:**
1. **Adjusted Longitudinal Distance**: 
   - Distance at 14.0s = -0.10 m.
2. **Relative Velocity (Longitudinal)**: 
   - Positive at 6.87 m/s.
3. **TTC Calculation**: 
   - TTC = |-0.10 m| / 6.87 m/s ≈ 0.015 s (indicating imminent collision).
4. **MDC Calculation**:
   - With a longitudinal distance nearing 0 and same lane (lateral alignment), MDC is effectively 0, indicating a collision potential.

**Risk Assessment:**
- **TTC Indicator**: ≤ 0.5 seconds indicates Extreme Risk.
- **MDC Indicator**: ≤ 0 meters infers a Collision.

Given the timings and distance, Obstacle 3523 aligns with collision criteria due to its proximity, converging longitudinal trajectory, and same-lane orientation.

### Conclusion

**Is This a Collision Scenario?**

Yes, this is a collision scenario due to Obstacle 3523, which has a risk score of 0 at 14.0 seconds. Obstacle 3520 does not contribute to this risk scenario as it moves away from the ego vehicle.
