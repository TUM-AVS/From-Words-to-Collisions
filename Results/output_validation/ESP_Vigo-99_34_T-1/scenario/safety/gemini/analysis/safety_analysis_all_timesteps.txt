### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
    - Obstacle ID: 3520
    - Relative Direction: Front
    - Distance Risk Reason: DTClong is 20.68m, which is > 5, indicating negligible risk. DTClat is 0.0m, but since the obstacle is directly in front, lateral distance is less important. The obstacle has been moving away longitudinally over the past 10 timesteps.
    - Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 5
    - Lateral Distance Safety Score: 0
    - Overall Distance Safety Score: 5.0
    - Time Risk Reason: TTClong is inf, indicating no longitudinal collision risk. TTClat is 0.0, but given the longitudinal motion and direction, this doesn't pose an immediate threat.
    - Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 5
    - Lateral Time Safety Score: 0
    - Overall Time Safety Score: 5.0
    - Overall Risk Score: 5

    - Obstacle ID: 3523
    - Relative Direction: Behind
    - Distance Risk Reason: DTClong is -0.10m indicating an imminent collision risk as the obstacle is very close. The obstacle has been approaching the ego vehicle from behind over the past 10 timesteps.
    - Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 0
    - Lateral Distance Safety Score: 0
    - Overall Distance Safety Score: 0.0
    - Time Risk Reason: TTClong is 0.01s, extremely low and suggesting imminent collision.  TTClat is 0.0, but the primary risk is longitudinal. The decreasing TTClong over the previous timesteps confirms the high risk.
    - Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 1
    - Lateral Time Safety Score: 0
    - Overall Time Safety Score: 1.0
    - Overall Risk Score: 1

### Summary in JSON Format:  Summarize all obstacles with collision risk which Overall Risk Score is 0 and all obstacles with extreme risk which Overall Risk Score is 1 in the following JSON format. Make sure if they don't exist, set them as `null`:
```json
{
    "CollisionObstacle": null,
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "3523",
        "OverallRiskScore": "1"
    }
}
```
