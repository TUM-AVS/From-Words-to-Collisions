Here's the collision risk analysis:

**Obstacle 30374:** This obstacle is stationary and remains in the same lanelet (379) as the ego vehicle.  The minimum distance between the ego vehicle and this obstacle over the provided time steps is approximately 7 meters. While the vehicles are in the same lane, the distance and the ego vehicle's deceleration suggest that a collision is unlikely.  I assess the risk as **Medium (3)**.

**Obstacle 30378:** This obstacle is in a different lanelet (104) and moving with a decreasing velocity. The provided data shows no indication of a potential collision with the ego vehicle. Thus, I assess the risk as **Negligible (5)**.
