Obstacle 30374: This obstacle is stationary and remains in the same lanelet (379) as the ego vehicle. While the ego vehicle is decelerating in the same lanelet, the minimum distance between them appears to be around 6-7 meters over the provided timesteps.  This proximity, combined with the ego vehicle's changing velocity, warrants attention, but doesn't represent an immediate collision risk.  I classify this as a Medium Risk (3).

Obstacle 30378: This obstacle is in a different lanelet (104) and is moving with a relatively high velocity, though decelerating. Its trajectory does not seem to intersect with the ego vehicle's path based on the given positions.  While its proximity might warrant some attention, the different lanelets and the obstacle's consistent deceleration suggest a Low Risk (4).
