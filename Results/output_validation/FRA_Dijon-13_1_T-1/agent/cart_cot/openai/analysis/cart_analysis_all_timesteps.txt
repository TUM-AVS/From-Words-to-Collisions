### Analysis:

**Ego Vehicle** (ID: 30375.0) is in lanelet 379.0, moving with a decreasing velocity from 3.9265 m/s at 2.6 seconds to 1.2618 m/s at 3.5 seconds. It's decelerating and has a changing orientation, indicating it may be planning to stop or adjust its path significantly.

**Obstacle 30374.0** is stationary in lanelet 379.0, directly in the path of the ego vehicle. The relative positions from 2.6 to 3.5 seconds show the ego vehicle approaching this obstacle while decelerating. This obstacle poses a high risk if no action is taken by the ego vehicle to stop or change lanes since it continues to be in the path. Given that they share the same lanelet and the relative distance is decreasing, there is an extreme risk of collision unless the ego vehicle comes to a stop before reaching the obstacle.

**Obstacle 30378.0** is in a different lanelet (104.0) and is moving, but with a decelerating speed, indicating it might not stay in its lane or pose an immediate threat directly. Its decreasing velocity shows it is possibly stopping in a neighboring lane, thus potentially not directly affecting the ego vehicle's lane.

### Evaluation:

- **Obstacle 30374.0**: This stationary obstacle is in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle and poses an **extreme risk** of collision (Risk Level 1) if the ego vehicle does not stop or take evasive actions. The ego is decelerating heavily, and this justifies the expectation of collision unless preventive action is manifested.

- **Obstacle 30378.0** does not pose an immediate risk to the ego, as its lanelet and trajectory suggest it will not intersect with the ego's projected path.
