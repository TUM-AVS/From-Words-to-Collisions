Obstacle 30374 is stationary and remains in the same lane as the ego vehicle, with a decreasing distance over the timesteps. At the last timestep (3.5s), the distance is approximately 7 meters, and ego's velocity is decreasing but still positive.  This represents a high risk of collision if the ego vehicle does not brake sufficiently.

Obstacle 30378 is in a different lanelet and although initially closer to the ego vehicle than obstacle 30374, the lateral distance and differing headings suggest a low risk of collision.
