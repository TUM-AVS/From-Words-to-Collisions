### Analysis:

**Ego Vehicle and Obstacles Analysis at 3.5 seconds:**

- **Ego Vehicle** (30375.0):
  - Position: (-350.8596, -330.3005)
  - Orientation: -2.8478 rad
  - Velocity: 1.2618 m/s
  - Lanelet: 379.0

- **Obstacle 30374.0**:
  - Position: (-355.619, -331.7315)
  - Orientation: -2.8496 rad
  - Velocity: 0.0 m/s (stationary)
  - Lanelet: 379.0
  - Relative to Ego: 
    - Longitudinal position: about -4.76m
    - Ego is moving closer to stationary obstruction in same lanelet.
    - Lateral distance: ~1.43m
  - Since the obstacle is stationary and in the same lanelet, the TTC would approach zero as ego decelerates; hence, a potential collision is very probable.
  - **Overall Risk Score: 0 (Collision imminent, physical contact likely without intervention)**

- **Obstacle 30378.0**:
  - Position: (-359.6636, -347.498)
  - Orientation: 1.8619 rad
  - Velocity: 3.2364 m/s
  - Lanelet: 104.0
  - Relative to Ego: 
    - Different lanelet; no apparent longitudinal overlap.
    - Lateral distance exceeds immediate danger length.
  - **Overall Risk Score: 5 (Negligible risk)**

In conclusion, the most concerning obstacle is 30374.0, which is stationary and in the same lane as the ego vehicle, requiring immediate braking to avoid a collision.
