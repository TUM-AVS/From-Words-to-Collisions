At the most recent timestep (3.5 seconds), Obstacle 30374 is at a longitudinal distance of 0.46 m and a lateral distance of 0.00 m relative to the ego vehicle.  The MDC is less than 0.5m and the relative longitudinal velocity is negative, indicating a very high risk of collision. Obstacle 30378 is at a longitudinal distance of 8.90 m and a lateral distance of 12.30 m.  While the relative longitudinal and lateral velocities are negative (moving towards the ego vehicle), the distance is sufficient to consider this obstacle as not posing an immediate threat.

Obstacle 30374:
- Proximity: 1 (Extreme Risk).  The obstacle is extremely close to the ego vehicle (<0.5m).
- MDC: 1 (Extreme Risk). Less than 0.5m. Approaching collision.
- TTC: Collision likely within the next timestep given the closing velocity and proximity. Hence, TTC is estimated to be <0.5. TTC:1 (Extreme Risk).

Obstacle 30378:
- Proximity: 4 (Low risk). The obstacle is over 5m and has greater than 3 meters but less than or equal to 5 meters MDC.
- MDC: 4 (Low risk) The distance is approximately sqrt(8.9^2 + 12.3^2) â‰ˆ 15.1m, so MDC > 5.0m.
- TTC: 5 (Negligible Risk). With a distance of over 15 meters and a relatively low closing velocity, the TTC is likely to be > 5 seconds.
