Obstacle 30374 is in front of the ego vehicle with a very small longitudinal distance of 0.46m and closing at -1.26 m/s.  This is extremely dangerous and a collision is imminent.

Obstacle 30378 is approaching the ego vehicle both longitudinally and laterally. While the current distance is larger than for Obstacle 30374, the continuous lateral and longitudinal closing motion needs careful observation and suggests a potential high risk situation in the near future.

Risk Levels:
0: Collision - Physical contact occurred or unavoidable
1: Extreme Risk - Immediate collision likely
2: High Risk - Close to collision, needs quick action
3: Medium Risk - Manageable with proper reaction
4: Low Risk - Minimal risk, sufficient time to react
5: Negligible Risk - No significant risk
