### Safety analysis for timestep 3.5 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 30374**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 30374 is directly in front of the ego vehicle with a longitudinal distance of 0.46m and a lateral distance of 0.46m at the last timestep.  The decreasing distances across successive timesteps and the negative longitudinal velocity indicate a very high probability of imminent collision.
- Distance safety score: 1 (Extreme Risk)
- Time Risk reason: Given the closing velocity and minimal distance, the TTC is extremely short, less than 0.5 seconds.
- Time safety score: 1 (Extreme Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 1 (Extreme Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 30378**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 30378, while approaching the ego vehicle from the front-left, maintains a relatively safe longitudinal and lateral distance of 8.90m at the last timestep.
- Distance safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- Time Risk reason:  Although the obstacle is moving towards the ego vehicle both longitudinally and laterally, the current distance and relative velocities suggest a TTC greater than 5 seconds.
- Time safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
