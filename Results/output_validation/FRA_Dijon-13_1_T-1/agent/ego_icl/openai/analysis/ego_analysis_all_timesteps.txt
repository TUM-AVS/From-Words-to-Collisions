Let's begin analyzing the scenario at the most recent timestep, focusing on the critical details, including direction-based risk assessment, trajectory analysis, and Time-to-Collision (TTC) and Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC) calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

**Obstacle 30374:**
- **Position:** Directly in front of the ego vehicle
- **Adjusted Distances (At 3.5s):** Longitudinal: 0.46m, Lateral: 0.00m
- **Relative Velocity (At 3.5s):** Longitudinal: -1.26 m/s, Lateral: 0.00 m/s
- **Motion Description:** Obstacle is aligned longitudinally and driving towards the ego vehicle.

#### Trajectory Analysis:
- The obstacle has consistently decreased its longitudinal distance from 2.92m to 0.46m over the timesteps.
- The closing velocity is -1.26 m/s, indicating the obstacle is rapidly approaching the ego vehicle in the same lane.

#### Calculations:
- **TTC (Longitudinal):** TTC = Distance / |Relative Velocity| = 0.46m / 1.26 m/s ≈ 0.37 seconds
- **MDC (Longitudinal):** Given longitudinal distance is 0.46m, approaching near-zero, suggests an extreme collision risk scenario.

#### Risk Assessment:
- **TTC < 0.5 seconds** signifies **Extreme Risk (1)**.
- **MDC is in the range (0 < 0.5m)** confirms **Extreme Risk (1)**.

**Obstacle 30378:**
- **Position:** In the front-left of the ego vehicle
- **Adjusted Distances (At 3.5s):** Longitudinal: 8.90m, Lateral: 12.30m
- **Relative Velocity (At 3.5s):** Longitudinal: -1.27 m/s, Lateral: -3.24 m/s
- **Motion Description:** Driving towards the ego vehicle both longitudinally and laterally from the left.

#### Trajectory Analysis:
- Continual decrease in longitudinal and lateral distances, showing a trend toward crossing paths.

#### Calculations:
- **TTC (Longitudinal):** TTC = 8.90m / 1.27 m/s ≈ 7.01 seconds
- **TTC (Lateral):** TTC = 12.30m / 3.24 m/s ≈ 3.80 seconds
- **MDC (Calculated based on crossing paths):** Projected path intersection suggests sufficient distance but needs attention.

#### Risk Assessment:
- **Lateral TTC = 3.80 seconds** and **Longitudinal MDC > 1.0m** positions this at **Medium Risk (3)**.

### Explanation:
- **Obstacle 30374** is at the highest risk of collision due to both a low TTC and approaching MDC, indicating a collision is nearly inevitable.
- While Obstacle 30378 does not pose an immediate collision threat, its changing trajectory demands monitoring to ensure no progressive risk increment.

This analysis recommends immediate evasive or mitigating actions for Obstacle 30374 to prevent collision and monitoring adjustments for Obstacle 30378.
