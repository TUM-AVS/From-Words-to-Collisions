At t=3.7s, Ego is in lanelet 379.0 at (-351.1062, -330.3745) with a velocity of 1.0029 m/s.

Obstacle 30374.0 is stationary in the same lanelet 379.0 at (-355.619, -331.7315).  The distance between Ego and this obstacle is approximately 4.5 meters. While Ego's velocity is decreasing, the close proximity and shared lanelet represent a high risk.  However, given the current deceleration of Ego, collision isn't imminent in the very next timestep. This warrants a Risk Score of 2 (High Risk) and won't be included in the JSON output.

Obstacle 30378.0 is in a different lanelet (104.0) at (-359.8111, -347.0059) with velocity 2.1677 m/s.  This obstacle is further away and in a different lanelet, posing less immediate risk. This is categorized as Medium/Low risk and also won't be included in the JSON output.
