### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 30374.0
- Distance Risk reason:  This obstacle is in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle and relatively close. Over the past several timesteps, the distance has remained fairly constant.  The Y-coordinate difference is small and steady, but a significant difference in X-coordinates persists.
- Distance safety score: 2 (High Risk)
- Time Risk reason: This obstacle is stationary, while the ego vehicle is moving, albeit slowly.  Even though the ego vehicle is decelerating, the continued proximity and the stationary nature of the obstacle present a high risk.
- Time safety score: 2 (High Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 2 (High Risk)


- Obstacle ID: 30378.0
- Distance Risk reason: This obstacle is in a different lanelet. While its Y-coordinate was initially closer to the ego vehicle's, it's now moving further away in the Y direction.  The X difference also indicates no immediate danger.
- Distance safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
- Time Risk reason:  While the obstacle is moving at a reasonable speed, it's decelerating and its trajectory is diverging from the ego vehicle's path. The different lanelets and the decreasing Y values suggest the risk is diminishing.
- Time safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 4 (Low Risk)


### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. **Most critical obstacle:** Obstacle 30374.0 poses the most significant risk due to its proximity to the ego vehicle and its stationary nature within the same lanelet.
2. **Trajectory Analysis (10 timesteps):**  Obstacle 30374.0 remains stationary throughout the entire period. The ego vehicle is moving in the same lanelet, slowly and decelerating, but still presents a collision risk. Obstacle 30378.0, although initially somewhat close, is moving away from the ego vehicle's path in a different lanelet.
3. **Relative Positions, Velocities, Accelerations:** The minimal lateral distance between the ego vehicle and obstacle 30374.0 raises concern. The ego vehicle's deceleration lessens the risk somewhat, but it's not enough to eliminate the high risk given the obstacle's stationary position. Obstacle 30378.0 has a diverging trajectory and poses less risk.
4. **Collision Determination:** No collision has occurred yet.  However, a collision with obstacle 30374.0 is possible if the ego vehicle doesn't stop or maneuver sufficiently.
5. **Reasoning:** Although the ego vehicle is decelerating, the continuous presence of a stationary obstacle in its direct path, separated only by a small lateral distance and in the same lane, warrants a high risk assessment.  The constant, close proximity raises significant concern even with the decreasing speed.
