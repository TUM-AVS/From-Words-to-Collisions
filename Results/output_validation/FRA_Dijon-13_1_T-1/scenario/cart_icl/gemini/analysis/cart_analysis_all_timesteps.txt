### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 30374.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 30374.0 is in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle and remains stationary throughout the provided timeframe.  The lateral distance is small and although the longitudinal distance is slightly increasing as the ego vehicle slows down, the minimal change and proximity still represent a risk.
- Distance safety score: 2
- Time Risk reason:  Ego vehicle is slowing down while the obstacle is stationary. The closing velocity is decreasing, but the proximity and continued presence in the same lane constitute a temporal risk.
- Time safety score: 2
- Overall Risk score: 2

- Obstacle ID: 30378.0
- Distance Risk reason:  Obstacle 30378.0 is in a different lanelet. The distance between the ego vehicle and this obstacle is significantly larger than the distance to obstacle 30374.0 and appears to be increasing. The orientations also suggest diverging paths.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: The obstacle is moving away from the ego vehicle at a relatively high speed. The velocity difference reduces risk significantly, and the different lanelets further support this. The continuous negative acceleration of the obstacle wouldn't likely lead to an interaction even with prolonged observation time.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5


### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. **Identify potential collisions:** Focus on obstacles in the same lane or with converging trajectories. Obstacle 30374.0 is in the same lane and stationary. Obstacle 30378.0 is in a different lane and moving away.
2. **Assess 30374.0:** Although ego is decelerating, it is still moving towards the stationary obstacle in the same lane.  This presents a high risk.
3. **Assess 30378.0:** This obstacle poses no immediate risk due to its different lane and increasing distance.
4. **Collision Determination:** No collision occurs within the provided timeframe, but obstacle 30374.0 represents a persistent risk.

  "ScenarioAnalysis": {
    "IsCollisionScenario": false,
    "Reasoning": "No collision occurs within the timeframe.  Obstacle 30374.0 represents a high risk due to its stationary presence in the ego vehicle's lane and their proximity, despite the ego's deceleration. Obstacle 30378.0 is not a concern due to different lane, diverging trajectory, and increasing distance."
