### Obstacle Analysis:

#### Obstacle ID: 30374.0
- **Distance Risk Reason**: The obstacle is stationary and has remained in the same position across all timesteps, located approximately 6.5 meters away from the ego vehicle in the same lanelet. This constant relative position suggests a moderate risk due to proximity.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 3 (Medium Risk)
- **Time Risk Reason**: Since the obstacle is stationary and the ego vehicle is decelerating, the risk based on time is consistent. There is no relative movement that increases risk over time.
- **Time Safety Score**: 3 (Medium Risk)
- **Overall Risk Score**: 3 (Medium Risk)

#### Obstacle ID: 30378.0
- **Distance Risk Reason**: The obstacle is moving in a different lanelet, consistently showing an increasing separation from the ego vehicle, which is moving away from the point of closest approach.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 4 (Low Risk)
- **Time Risk Reason**: The obstacle is decelerating, and given its trajectory away from the ego vehicle, the risk of collision decreases as time progresses.
- **Time Safety Score**: 4 (Low Risk)
- **Overall Risk Score**: 4 (Low Risk)

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:

1. **Obstacle 30374.0**: It's stationary in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle, remaining at a fixed distance. With the ego vehicle's deceleration, it suggests a manageable scenario, implying medium risk.
   
2. **Obstacle 30378.0**: Although this obstacle is moving towards the ego vehicle's lanelet, its trajectory remains separate and divergent over time, resulting in low risk.

3. **Collision Potential**: Neither obstacle presents an imminent collision risk. The distances and velocities suggest there is enough time and space to avoid any immediate threat, particularly as clear evasive action is feasible due to speed and position.
