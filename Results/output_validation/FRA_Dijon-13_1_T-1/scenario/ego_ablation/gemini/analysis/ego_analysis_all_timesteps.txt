Obstacle 30374 shows a very high risk of collision.  At the last timestep (3.7 seconds), it is only 0.20 meters directly in front of the ego vehicle and closing at a speed of 1.00 m/s. This extremely small distance and the continuing approach suggest an imminent collision.

Obstacle 30378, while also approaching, is further away at 8.59m longitudinally and 11.84m laterally.  While its motion should be monitored, it does not represent an immediate threat in the final timestep provided.
