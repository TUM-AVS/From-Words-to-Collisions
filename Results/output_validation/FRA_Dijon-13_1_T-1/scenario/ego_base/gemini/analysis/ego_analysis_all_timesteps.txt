Obstacle 30374 is very close to the ego vehicle, at a longitudinal distance of 0.20m.  The relative longitudinal velocity is -1.00 m/s, indicating it is still moving towards the ego vehicle. While the relative velocity has decreased, the short distance poses an extreme risk.

Obstacle 30378 is at a safer distance longitudinally (8.59m) and laterally (11.84m). While it is moving towards the ego vehicle both longitudinally and laterally, the current distance and relative velocities suggest a lower risk compared to obstacle 30374.

**Risk Levels and Definitions:**
<Collision (Score: 0)>: Actual collision has occurred or is unavoidable within the next timestep.
<Extreme Risk (Score: 1)>: Immediate collision or very high likelihood of impact. Urgent action is required.
<High Risk (Score: 2)>: Close to collision or highly probable collision path. Needs prompt attention and quick manoeuvring.
<Medium Risk (Score: 3)>: Moderate collision risk but manageable with timely reactions and proper strategies.
<Low Risk (Score: 4)>: Minimal collision risk. The situation is controllable with sufficient time to react.
<Negligible Risk (Score: 5)>: No significant collision risk. Obstacles are either moving away or far enough not to interfere.
