### Safety analysis for timestep 2.8s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 30374
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 30374 is very close longitudinally (2.13m) and laterally (2.13m) in front of the ego vehicle, indicating a very high risk of collision.
- Distance safety score: 1
- Time Risk reason: The relative longitudinal velocity (-3.18 m/s) and decreasing distance suggest a very short time to collision.
- Time safety score: 1
- Overall Risk score: 1

- Obstacle ID: 30378
- Distance Risk reason: While Obstacle 30378 is further away at 10.52m both longitudinally and laterally, its motion indicates it is moving towards the ego vehicle.  
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: The relative velocity and motion suggest a moderate time to collision. It's less urgent than 30374 but still requires attention.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3


### Safety analysis for timestep 2.9s - 3.7s:

The situation progressively worsens for Obstacle 30374 as the distance continues to decrease over each timestep.  The longitudinal distance reaches 0.2m at 3.7 seconds.  The lateral distance remains equal to the longitudinal distance throughout, indicating constant alignment and continued high risk along both axes. Obstacle 30378's risk, while initially moderate, diminishes slightly as lateral movement becomes more dominant.  The risk is still present, however, and the situation requires monitoring. The detailed breakdown for each timestep follows the same pattern as for 2.8s, with the numbers updating based on the provided data. For brevity, only the key risk scores and a summary are provided below.


**Simplified Analysis for Timesteps 2.9s - 3.7s:**

### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
  "CollisionObstacle": null,
  "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {
    "ObstacleID": "30374",
    "OverallRiskScore": "1"
  },
  "IsCollisionScenario": false, 
  "Justification": "While no collision is registered within the provided timeframe, Obstacle 30374 poses an extreme risk and is on a near-certain collision course with the ego vehicle if no evasive action is taken. The decreasing longitudinal and lateral distances, coupled with the negative relative velocity, indicate a high probability of impact in the very near future."
