### Obstacle-by-Obstacle Analysis (Most Recent Timestep: 3.7s)

#### **Obstacle 30374 (Front)**
- **Adjusted Distance**: Longitudinal = 0.20m, Lateral = 0.00m  
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal = -1.00 m/s (approaching), Lateral = 0.00 m/s  
- **Motion**: Driving toward ego longitudinally, exact lateral alignment.  

**Trajectory Analysis**:  
- Longitudinal distance decreases from 2.13m (2.8s) to 0.20m (3.7s).  
- Relative velocity remains negative (approaching) but decelerating slightly (acceleration = -0.69 m/s²).  
- Lateral alignment is exact (0.00m), but no lateral movement.  

**Risk Assessment**:  
1. **Time-to-Collision (TTC)**:  
   - TTC = Distance / |Relative Velocity| = 0.20 / 1.00 = **0.20 seconds** (Extreme Risk, TTC ≤ 0.5s).  
2. **Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC)**:  
   - MDC = 0.20m (Extreme Risk, MDC ≤ 0.5m).  
3. **Overall Risk**:  
   - Both TTC and MDC indicate **Extreme Risk (1)**.  
   - **Collision imminent** unless immediate intervention occurs.

#### **Obstacle 30378 (Front-Left)**
- **Adjusted Distance**: Longitudinal = 8.59m, Lateral = 11.84m  
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal = -1.00 m/s (approaching), Lateral = -2.17 m/s (approaching from left).  
- **Motion**: Driving toward ego both longitudinally and laterally.  

**Trajectory Analysis**:  
- Longitudinal distance decreases slowly (from 10.52m to 8.59m).  
- Lateral distance decreases more rapidly (from 15.82m to 11.84m).  
- Both velocities are negative (approaching), with lateral deceleration (-5.32 m/s²).  

**Risk Assessment**:  
1. **Time-to-Collision (TTC)**:  
   - Longitudinal TTC = 8.59 / 1.00 = 8.59s (No Risk).  
   - Lateral TTC = 11.84 / 2.17 = 5.46s (No Risk).  
   - **No immediate collision risk** (TTC > 5s in both dimensions).  
2. **Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC)**:  
   - MDC is the smaller of the two distances: **8.59m (No Risk, MDC > 5.0m)**.  
3. **Overall Risk**:  
   - **No Risk (5)**.

### **Collision Scenario Determination**
- **Obstacle 30374**:  
  - **Extreme Risk (1)** with TTC = 0.20s and MDC = 0.20m.  
  - Collision is imminent unless evasive action is taken.  
- **Obstacle 30378**:  
  - **No Risk (5)**, no immediate threat.  

This qualifies as a **collision scenario** because Obstacle 30374 is in **Extreme Risk (1)** with converging trajectories and critically low TTC/MDC.
