### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
    - Obstacle ID: 30374
    - Relative Direction: Front
    - Distance Risk Reason: The obstacle is extremely close longitudinally (0.20m) and has been consistently approaching the ego vehicle over the past 10 timesteps. Lateral distance is 0m, indicating a direct front collision course.
    - Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 1
    - Lateral Distance Safety Score: 0
    - Overall Distance Safety Score: 1.0
    - Time Risk Reason:  TTClong is extremely low (0.20s) and decreasing. This, combined with the very short DTClong, indicates a high risk of imminent frontal collision. TTClat is 0s - not applicable in this case as the lateral distance is also zero.
    - Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 1
    - Lateral Time Safety Score: 0
    - Overall Time Safety Score: 1.0
    - Overall Risk Score: 1

    - Obstacle ID: 30378
    - Relative Direction: Front-left
    - Distance Risk Reason: DTClong is 8.59m, LatDTC is 11.84m. Both are outside the immediate danger zone, even with their decreasing trend over the past timesteps.
    - Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 5
    - Lateral Distance Safety Score: 5
    - Overall Distance Safety Score: 5.0
    - Time Risk Reason: TTClong (8.59s) and TTClat (5.46s) are both very high. This combined with the safe distances makes the time-based risk minimal for now.
    - Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 5
    - Lateral Time Safety Score: 5
    - Overall Time Safety Score: 5.0
    - Overall Risk Score: 5
