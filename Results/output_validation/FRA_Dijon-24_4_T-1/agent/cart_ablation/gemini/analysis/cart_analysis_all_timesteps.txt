Analysis:

Obstacle 30504: This obstacle is stationary. The minimum distance between the ego vehicle and this obstacle over the provided timesteps is approximately 4.7 meters. While the ego vehicle is approaching this obstacle, it is decelerating. Given the current trajectories and assuming the ego vehicle continues to decelerate, a collision is not imminent within the foreseeable future (next few seconds based on the provided data). Therefore, I classify this obstacle as a Medium Risk (3).

Obstacle 30509: This obstacle is also stationary and far from the ego vehicle (minimum distance of approximately 16 meters).  There is no foreseeable risk of collision with this obstacle. Therefore, I classify this obstacle as Negligible Risk (5).
