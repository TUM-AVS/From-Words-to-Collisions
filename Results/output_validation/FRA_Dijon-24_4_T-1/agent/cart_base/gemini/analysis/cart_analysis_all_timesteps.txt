Obstacle 30504.0 is stationary and remains at a consistent distance and poses no immediate threat.  Calculating the distance between Ego and Obstacle 30504.0 at the latest timestamp (10.5s):  sqrt((-144.9998 - -147.3242)^2 + (-134.8168 - -131.4415)^2) = sqrt(2.3244^2 + -3.3753^2) ≈ 4.09.  Given the ego vehicle's deceleration and the relatively safe distance, this obstacle is assessed as a low risk (4).

Obstacle 30509.0 is stationary and far from the ego vehicle's trajectory. Calculating the distance at the latest timestamp (10.5s): sqrt((-144.9998 - -128.7869)^2 + (-134.8168 - -121.2295)^2) = sqrt(-16.2129^2 + -13.5873^2) ≈ 21.14. Thus, this obstacle is assessed as negligible risk (5).
