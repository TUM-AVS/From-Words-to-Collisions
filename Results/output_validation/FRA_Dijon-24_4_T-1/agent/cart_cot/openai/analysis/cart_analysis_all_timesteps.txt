At the most recent timestamp of 10.5 seconds, the ego vehicle (ID: 30507.0) is at position (-144.9998, -134.8168) with a velocity of 0.7061 units. The ego vehicle is showing a steady deceleration trend throughout the observance, indicating that it is approaching a stop.

The two obstacles, 30504.0 at position (-147.3242, -131.4415) and 30509.0 at position (-128.7869, -121.2295), are stationary with zero velocity and acceleration in all time steps.

Assessing the trends and positions:
1. **Obstacle 30504.0** is relatively close spatially compared to the ego, but due to its stationary nature and the ego's deceleration, the risk is reduced.

2. **Obstacle 30509.0** is quite far from the ego, and both spatial and velocity factors are low-risk as no immediate proximity or path intersection is indicated.

Given these observations:
- **TTC** (Time to Collision) is not critical here as the heading and deceleration of the ego ensure the relative distance is increasing as it slows.
- **MDC** (Minimum Distance to Collision) shows the ego and obstacle 30504.0 are not in an imminent collision path under current dynamics, mitigating any urgency in risk. However, 30504.0 is the closest, and thus subject to more attention.

Neither stationary obstacle presents an imminent collision or extreme risk due to the maintained distance and no conflicting trajectories with the ego's current movement pattern. Thus, the risks remain mainly negligible or low.
