### Analysis:

1. **Obstacle 30504.0**:
   - **Position**: (-147.3242, -131.4415) (stationary)
   - **Ego Position**: (-144.9998, -134.8168)
   - **Distance**: ~3.33m (calculated using Euclidean distance)
   - **Relative Motion**: Ego is decelerating (velocity decreasing from 2.0334 to 0.7061 m/s) and moving towards the obstacle but at a reducing speed.
   - **TTC**: Not directly calculable since the obstacle is stationary, but the ego is slowing down and not on a direct collision path (lateral separation exists).
   - **Risk**: Low (4) - No immediate danger due to lateral separation and deceleration.

2. **Obstacle 30509.0**:
   - **Position**: (-128.7869, -121.2295) (stationary)
   - **Ego Position**: (-144.9998, -134.8168)
   - **Distance**: ~16.5m (calculated using Euclidean distance)
   - **Relative Motion**: Ego is moving away from the obstacle (based on positions and orientation).
   - **TTC**: Not applicable as the ego is not approaching the obstacle.
   - **Risk**: Negligible (5) - No meaningful risk.

### Conclusion:
- No collision or extreme risk obstacles detected.
- The ego vehicle is decelerating and not on a direct collision path with any obstacle.
