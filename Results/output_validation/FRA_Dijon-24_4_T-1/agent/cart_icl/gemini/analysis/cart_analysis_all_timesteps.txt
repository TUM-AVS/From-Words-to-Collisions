Here's the collision risk assessment and the required JSON output.

**Analysis:**

At t=10.5s, Obstacle 30504 is stationary and located at (-147.3242, -131.4415) while the ego vehicle is at (-144.9998, -134.8168).  The distance between the ego and obstacle 30504 is approximately 3.46 meters. The ego vehicle's velocity is decreasing, but it's still moving towards the obstacle, albeit slowly. Given the current trajectories and the ego vehicle's slowing velocity, the risk of collision is low if the ego vehicle continues to decelerate, or comes to a stop.  Since the obstacle is stationary, the primary concern is the ego's motion.

Obstacle 30509 is stationary and far from the ego vehicle, posing negligible risk.
