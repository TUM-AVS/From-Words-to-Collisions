To analyze the scenario, let's assess both obstacles relative to the ego vehicle across the 10 timesteps, focusing particularly on positions and velocities to determine the risk levels.

### Detailed Analysis:

**Ego Vehicle (30507.0):**
- The ego vehicle is moving in the positive y-direction, gradually reducing speed from 2.0334 m/s to 0.7061 m/s over the 10 timesteps.
- The vehicle's orientation remains consistently around 1.60 radians, indicating it is moving almost due north, with a slight leftward deviation near the end of the period due to deceleration.

**Obstacle 30504.0:**
- Stationary at position (-147.3242, -131.4415) throughout all timesteps.
- Positioned slightly ahead to the left of the ego's path, given the ego’s consistent forward and slightly rightward trend.

**Obstacle 30509.0:**
- Also stationary at position (-128.7869, -121.2295) throughout all timesteps.
- Positioned well to the right of the ego's planned trajectory.

### Risk Assessment:

**Obstacle 30504.0:**
- The ego vehicle is moving from position (-144.9613, -136.1081) to (-144.9998, -134.8168) over 10 timesteps.
- Longitudinal and lateral distance: Approximately 4.0 meters longitudinally ahead, and closes to around 3.4 meters laterally left from the obstacle throughout the scenario.
- The ego car's deceleration further removes any immediate threat, as it is clearly decelerating and drifting away from the obstacle.

**Obstacle 30509.0:**
- The obstacle is positioned significantly off the ego’s trajectory on the ego's right and slightly forward.
- From the ego’s starting position, the obstacle has consistent lateral clearance of over 16 meters, which shows no direct collision path.

### Conclusion:
Neither obstacle posed a collision risk through the given timeframe due to significant lateral difference and deceleration strategy by the ego vehicle.

**Risk Levels:**
- **Obstacle 30504.0:** No immediate risk, low risk at best. 
- **Obstacle 30509.0:** Minimal relative risk due to positive clearance.

### JSON Output:

```json
{
    "CollisionObstacles": [],
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null,
    "HighRiskObstacle": null
}
```

Both obstacles are classified at a level of low or negligible risk due to adequate clearance and lack of intersecting trajectories.
