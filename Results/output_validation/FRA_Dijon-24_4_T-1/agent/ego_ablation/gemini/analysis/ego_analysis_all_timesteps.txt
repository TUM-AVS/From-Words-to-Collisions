At the most recent timestamp (10.5 seconds), two obstacles are present:

**Obstacle 30504:** This obstacle is located to the left of the ego vehicle, with a longitudinal distance of 0.00 m and a lateral distance of 0.60 m.  The longitudinal velocity suggests it is either stationary relative to the ego or moving very slowly. Given the consistent lateral distance of around 0.6 meters and the low longitudinal velocity, the risk of collision is low.

* **Proximity:** 2 - Although not colliding, the lateral distance is small.
* **MDC:** 2 - Near collision longitudinally (0.00m) but some lateral separation.
* **TTC:** 1 -  The near-zero longitudinal distance combined with the non-zero closing velocity suggests a high risk of collision in the immediate future if the trajectory does not change.

**Obstacle 30509:** This obstacle is located to the front-right of the ego vehicle, with a longitudinal distance of 8.54 m and a lateral distance of -15.04 m. It has a longitudinal velocity of -0.71 m/s, indicating it is moving towards the ego vehicle. The lateral distance is substantial, and the longitudinal distance is also relatively large.

* **Proximity:** 4 -  A safe distance currently.
* **MDC:** 5 - No immediate collision risk given the current distance and velocity.
* **TTC:** 5 -  Collision is unlikely given the current trajectory.


Based on this assessment, Obstacle 30504 poses an extreme risk, while Obstacle 30509 poses no significant risk.
