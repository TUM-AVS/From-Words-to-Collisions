At the most recent timestep (10.5 seconds):

* **Obstacle 30504:** This obstacle is located to the left of the ego vehicle, with a longitudinal distance of 0.00 m and a lateral distance of 0.60 m.  It is essentially alongside the ego vehicle. While the longitudinal velocity suggests it is moving slowly towards the ego car (-0.71 m/s), the continuous lateral distance of around 0.6m during the provided timeframe suggests it is maintaining a safe lateral distance, thus presenting negligible risk. Risk score: 5

* **Obstacle 30509:** This obstacle is located to the front-right of the ego vehicle at a longitudinal distance of 8.54 m and a lateral distance of -15.04 m.  It is moving towards the ego vehicle longitudinally at -0.71 m/s.  Given the distances and relative velocity, there's no immediate danger of collision. Risk score: 5
