### Safety analysis for timestep 10.5s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

Based on the provided data, Obstacle 30504 has collided with the ego vehicle.  At t=10.5s, both longitudinal and lateral distances are 0.0m, and the relative longitudinal velocity is still negative, indicating continued movement towards or into the ego vehicle.  

Obstacle 30509, while approaching the ego vehicle longitudinally, maintains a safe distance (8.54m) and poses no immediate threat.


### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 30504**
- Distance Risk reason:  Collision has occurred. Both longitudinal and lateral distances are 0.0m at t=10.5s.
- Distance safety score: 0
- Time Risk reason: Collision has likely already occurred given 0.0m distance and negative relative longitudinal velocity. TTC is effectively zero.
- Time safety score: 0
- Overall Risk score: 0

- **Obstacle ID: 30509**
- Distance Risk reason:  Located 8.54m longitudinally and laterally from the ego vehicle.  Poses no immediate distance risk.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: While approaching longitudinally, the relative velocity is slow, and the distance is substantial, providing ample time to react.  TTC is greater than 5 seconds.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5
