### Obstacle-by-Obstacle Analysis

#### Obstacle 30504 (Left of ego car)
- **Adjusted Distances (most recent timestep):**  
  - Longitudinal: 0.00 m (exact alignment)  
  - Lateral: 0.60 m  
- **Relative Velocity:**  
  - Longitudinal: -0.71 m/s (moving away from ego)  
  - Lateral: 0.00 m/s (no lateral motion)  
- **Motion Description:** Exact longitudinal alignment, no lateral relative motion.  
- **Trajectory Analysis:**  
  - Over the timesteps, the longitudinal distance has decreased to 0.00 m, but the lateral distance remains stable at ~0.60 m.  
  - The longitudinal velocity is negative, indicating the obstacle is moving away from the ego car longitudinally.  
  - No lateral motion means the lateral distance is not closing.  
- **TTC Calculation:**  
  - Longitudinal TTC: Not applicable (moving away)  
  - Lateral TTC: Not applicable (no relative motion)  
- **MDC Calculation:**  
  - The minimum distance is the lateral distance (0.60 m), which is stable.  
  - Since there is no closing velocity in either dimension, the MDC is effectively the current lateral distance.  
- **Risk Assessment:**  
  - MDC = 0.60 m (High Risk, 2)  
  - TTC = N/A (No Risk, 5)  
  - **Overall Risk:** High Risk (2)  

#### Obstacle 30509 (Front-right of ego car)
- **Adjusted Distances (most recent timestep):**  
  - Longitudinal: 8.54 m  
  - Lateral: -15.04 m  
- **Relative Velocity:**  
  - Longitudinal: -0.71 m/s (moving away from ego)  
  - Lateral: 0.00 m/s (no lateral motion)  
- **Motion Description:** Obstacle is driving toward the ego car longitudinally (but velocity is negative, meaning it is actually moving away).  
- **Trajectory Analysis:**  
  - The longitudinal distance is large (8.54 m) and increasing (negative relative velocity).  
  - The lateral distance is very large (-15.04 m) and stable (no lateral motion).  
- **TTC Calculation:**  
  - Longitudinal TTC: Not applicable (moving away)  
  - Lateral TTC: Not applicable (no relative motion)  
- **MDC Calculation:**  
  - The minimum distance is the lateral distance (15.04 m), which is very large and stable.  
- **Risk Assessment:**  
  - MDC = 15.04 m (No Risk, 5)  
  - TTC = N/A (No Risk, 5)  
  - **Overall Risk:** No Risk (5)

### Key Observations:
1. **Obstacle 30504** is longitudinally aligned with the ego car but is moving away longitudinally and has a stable lateral distance of 0.60 m. This poses a High Risk (2) due to the small lateral distance, but no collision or extreme risk is imminent.  
2. **Obstacle 30509** is far away and moving away from the ego car, posing no risk.  
3. No collision or extreme risk obstacles are identified in the most recent timestep.  
4. The trajectory of Obstacle 30504 suggests it will remain at a stable lateral distance, so no collision is predicted.
