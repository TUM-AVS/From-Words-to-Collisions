Obstacle 30504:

- Trajectory: This obstacle has been moving towards the ego vehicle longitudinally and is now perfectly aligned longitudinally (0.00m) with the ego vehicle. The lateral distance has remained relatively constant around 0.6 meters.
- TTC: Longitudinal TTC is not applicable since the relative longitudinal velocity is negative, meaning it's moving away or stationary relative to the ego vehicle in the longitudinal direction.  Lateral TTC is also not applicable due to zero lateral velocity.
- MDC: Since the obstacle is alongside the ego vehicle, the primary concern is lateral distance. The MDC is approximately 0.6m.
- Risk: Based on the MDC, the risk level is 3 (Medium Risk).

Obstacle 30509:

- Trajectory: This obstacle is in front and to the right of the ego vehicle, approaching longitudinally. The lateral distance remains fairly constant around -15m.
- TTC: Longitudinal TTC is approximately 8.54m / 0.71 m/s = 12.03 seconds. Lateral TTC is not applicable.
- MDC:  Given the obstacle's position, the minimum distance to collision is primarily determined by its longitudinal motion, approximately 8.54m.
- Risk: Based on both TTC and MDC, the risk level is 5 (Negligible Risk).


Final Assessment:

There are no obstacles posing a collision or extreme risk. Obstacle 30504 presents a medium risk due to its close lateral proximity.
