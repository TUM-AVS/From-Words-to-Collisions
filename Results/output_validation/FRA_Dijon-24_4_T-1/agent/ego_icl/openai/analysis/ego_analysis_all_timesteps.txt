To analyze the risks of collision with obstacles based on the provided data, I will consider the most recent timestamp (10.5 seconds) and evaluate the trajectory over previous timestamps to infer the immediate future position. I will use the adjusted distances that account for vehicle size and provide accurate risk assessments.

#### Obstacle 30504 Analysis:
- **Relative Position and Movement:** At 10.5 seconds, Obstacle 30504 is in the Left of the ego vehicle with adjusted distances being: longitudinal 0.00 meters and lateral 0.60 meters. The obstacle has a longitudinal relative velocity of -0.71 m/s, indicating it's aligned sideways with the ego car and not getting closer longitudinally. However, the lateral proximity is significant.
- **Trajectory Analysis:** Over the previous timestamps, the obstacle was consistently aligned at longitudinal 0.00m from 9.8 seconds onwards, primarily a lateral consideration.
- **TTC and MDC Calculation:**
  - Since the longitudinal distance remains at 0.00m, we check lateral movement. The velocity and acceleration show no closing trend laterally.
  - With lateral distance at 0.60m and no significant closing velocity laterally, risk remains in lateral MDC, estimated at 0.60m.
- **Risk Assessment:** For lateral proximity (0.60m) with no closing velocity, this indicates a High Risk (2) since neither dimension is near zero with a converging path trend.

#### Obstacle 30509 Analysis:
- **Relative Position and Movement:** At 10.5 seconds, Obstacle 30509 is in the Front-right of the ego vehicle with adjusted distances: longitudinal 8.54 meters and lateral -15.04 meters. The obstacle is approaching but still significantly far laterally.
- **Trajectory Analysis:** The obstacle has shown consistent approach over time but remains significantly separated both laterally and longitudinally.
- **TTC and MDC Calculation:**
  - Longitudinal TTC = 8.54 / 0.71 â‰ˆ 12.03 seconds
  - Lateral distance remains significantly large, ensuring divergence in path due to very high MDC.
- **Risk Assessment:** With high longitudinal TTC and substantial lateral separation, the risk score is Negligible Risk (5) as there's no imminent threat of collision.

### Conclusion:

After analyzing the positions, trajectories, and motion descriptions for each obstacle with adjusted measurements factored, the following JSON summary encapsulates the identified risks:

```json
{
    "CollisionObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "None",
        "OverallRiskScore": "N/A"
    },
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "None",
        "OverallRiskScore": "N/A"
    },
    "HighRiskObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "30504",
        "OverallRiskScore": "2"
    }
}
```

- **Collision/Extreme Risk:** No collision or extreme risk is present based on adjusted distances and relative velocities across both dimensions for all obstacles.
- **High Risk Identified:** Obstacle 30504 remains significantly close laterally with high risk due to its proximity, warranting cautious observation and potential evasive action if trends change.
