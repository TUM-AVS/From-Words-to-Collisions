At t=10.7s, Ego is at (-145.0044, -134.6761) and decelerating. Obstacle 30504 is stationary at (-147.3242, -131.4415), and Obstacle 30509 is stationary at (-128.7869, -121.2295).

Obstacle 30504:
The y-coordinate difference between Ego and Obstacle 30504 is roughly -3.23.  Given Ego's x-coordinate is getting closer to the obstacle's and Ego's orientation, a collision is possible if Ego continues on its current trajectory.  Further investigation is needed to determine if the lanelets represent intersecting paths, and the size/shape of Ego and the obstacle. The risk level is high (2), potentially extreme (1) depending on those factors.

Obstacle 30509:
Ego is moving away from Obstacle 30509 and poses negligible risk (5).

Based on the provided Cartesian coordinates, the minimal distance between Ego and Obstacle 30504 and their trajectories warrants a higher risk assessment. However, without additional context like lanelets' characteristics and object dimensions, it's difficult to definitively categorize as "Extreme Risk" (1). Due to the stationary nature of the obstacle and Egoâ€™s deceleration, I classify it as "High Risk" (2).

    "Reasoning": "No immediate collision detected, but Obstacle 30504 presents a high risk due to its proximity and Ego's trajectory. More information on lanelets and object dimensions is needed for a more precise risk assessment.  No collision with Obstacle 30509."
