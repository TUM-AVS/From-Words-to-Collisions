At t=10.7s, the ego vehicle is at (-145.0044, -134.6761) and decelerating. Obstacle 30504 is stationary at (-147.3242, -131.4415), and obstacle 30509 is stationary at (-128.7869, -121.2295).

Obstacle 30504: This obstacle is the closest to the ego vehicle.  While the ego vehicle is decelerating, the distance between them is still relatively small and the trajectories over the past few timesteps suggest a possible collision risk if the ego vehicle continues on its current path and deceleration rate.  Given the close proximity and continued approach, this is classified as an Extreme Risk (1).

Obstacle 30509: This obstacle is significantly farther from the ego vehicle and poses no immediate threat.
