### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 30504.0
- Distance Risk reason: The obstacle is relatively close to the ego vehicle laterally, with a small difference in their y-coordinates. Although the x-coordinates indicate some longitudinal separation, the historical data shows the ego vehicle moving closer to the obstacle over time, meaning the relative distance is likely within a range that could pose a risk with the ego vehicle slowing down.  Furthermore, they are in different lanelets, suggesting they are not meant to be in close proximity.
- Distance safety score: 2
- Time Risk reason: The obstacle is stationary, while the ego vehicle is moving slower but still approaching it based on previous timesteps. The ego vehicle is decelerating, decreasing the likelihood of an immediate collision.  However, the ego vehicle's deceleration rate has also been unstable, so this requires attention.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 2

- Obstacle ID: 30509.0
- Distance Risk reason: This obstacle is longitudinally and laterally further away from the ego vehicle than obstacle 30504.0.  The historical data reinforces that the ego vehicle is not on a trajectory to intersect with this obstacle.  They are also in different lanelets.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: The obstacle is stationary, and the ego vehicle's trajectory and deceleration don't suggest a future risk of collision.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5


### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. **Most critical obstacle:** Obstacle 30504.0 poses the most immediate risk due to its proximity and the ego vehicle's movement towards it in the Y direction and reduced speed.
2. **Trajectory analysis:** Over the 10 timesteps, the ego vehicle consistently moves closer to obstacle 30504.0 in Y position while decelerating and the X position difference remains fairly consistent. Obstacle 30509.0 remains stationary and far from the ego vehicle's trajectory.
3. **Relative position, velocity, and acceleration:**  The ego vehicle's decreasing velocity and relatively stable orientation suggest a controlled approach but with a potential risk of collision with obstacle 30504.0 given its continued proximity in the Y direction. Obstacle 30504.0 is stationary.
4. **Collision determination:**  While no collision has occurred yet, there is an increasing risk of collision with obstacle 30504.0 with continued movement on the current path due to its continuous proximity to the ego vehicle in the Y direction and reducing velocity.  Therefore, Obstacle 30504.0 poses a high risk, requiring attention and potential intervention to mitigate the risk. Obstacle 30509.0 poses negligible risk.

5. **Reasoning:** The combination of proximity, relative movement, and the ego vehicle's deceleration towards obstacle 30504.0 suggests a medium risk for collision, given its location in a different lanelet. Obstacle 30509.0's distance and static nature deem it a negligible risk.
