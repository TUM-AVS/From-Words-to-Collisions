### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep:

### Obstacle Analysis:
#### Obstacle ID: 30504.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is stationary at (-147.3242, -131.4415), while the ego vehicle is moving towards it but decelerating. The distance between them is decreasing but at a reducing rate due to ego's deceleration.
- **Distance safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk)
- **Time Risk reason**: The ego vehicle is decelerating (a = -0.4666 m/sÂ²) and its velocity is low (0.5302 m/s). The relative velocity is decreasing, reducing the risk of collision.
- **Time safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk)
- **Overall Risk score**: 3 (Medium Risk)

#### Obstacle ID: 30509.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is stationary at (-128.7869, -121.2295), far from the ego vehicle's trajectory. The distance is increasing as the ego moves away.
- **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- **Time Risk reason**: The obstacle is stationary and far away, with no risk of collision.
- **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- **Overall Risk score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. **Obstacle 30504.0**: The ego is moving towards this stationary obstacle but is decelerating. The distance is closing but the risk is mitigated by the ego's reducing speed.
2. **Obstacle 30509.0**: Far from the ego's path and stationary, posing no risk.
3. **Conclusion**: No immediate collision risk. The ego's deceleration ensures the situation remains manageable.
