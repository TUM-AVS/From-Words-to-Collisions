### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 30504.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 30504.0 is relatively close to the ego vehicle and poses a potential risk. While not immediately colliding, the proximity and the ego vehicle's decelerating trajectory warrant attention. The consistent position of the obstacle over the timesteps indicates it's stationary.
- Distance safety score: 2
- Time Risk reason: The ego vehicle is decelerating and moving towards the obstacle, increasing the risk over time.  While not an immediate collision, the closing distance combined with the ego vehicle's movement warrants a higher risk assessment.
- Time safety score: 2
- Overall Risk score: 2

- Obstacle ID: 30509.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 30509.0 is further away from the ego vehicle and poses less of a risk than 30504.0.  The obstacle's consistent position over the timesteps confirms it is stationary.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Given the greater distance and the ego vehicle's general trajectory, the time-based risk is low. The ego vehicle is not heading directly towards this obstacle.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4


### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
This is not a collision scenario. While Obstacle 30504.0 presents a high risk due to proximity and the ego vehicle's movement, it's not an immediate collision. The ego vehicle is decelerating, which may further mitigate the risk in future timesteps. Obstacle 30509.0 poses a much lower risk due to the greater distance and the ego vehicle's trajectory.

### Summary in JSON Format: 
```json
{
    "CollisionObstacles": [],
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null,
    "ScenarioAnalysis": {
        "IsCollisionScenario": false,
        "Reasoning": "No obstacle has a risk score of 0, indicating no immediate collision. While obstacle 30504.0 presents a high risk (score 2), the ego vehicle's deceleration suggests a potential mitigation of this risk in subsequent timesteps. Obstacle 30509.0 has a lower risk (score 4) due to distance and trajectory."
