### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep:

**Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.**

### Obstacle Analysis:

**Obstacle ID: 30504.0**
- **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is stationary with no changes in relative position to the ego vehicle across all timesteps. The ego vehicle is moving slightly away from the obstacle.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: Given the obstacle's zero velocity and zero acceleration, and the ego's decreasing velocity, the time to potential collision is increasing, indicating a diminishing risk.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

**Obstacle ID: 30509.0**
- **Distance Risk reason**: This obstacle is located much further from the ego vehicle and is also stationary. The orientation differences and unchanged positions indicate no risk of collision.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: The ego vehicle's trajectory and speed changes show it moving away, with no movement or change from the obstacle makes the risk negligible.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
- At each timestep, the ego vehicle's velocity is decreasing, showing deceleration over time.
- Both obstacles are stationary, and their positions do not change, indicating they are not a collision threat.
- The ego vehicle's path does not intersect with obstacles as it is moving along a different trajectory and lanelet.
- No change in speed or position of obstacles over the timeline renders time and proximity risks negligible.
