Obstacle 30504 is very close to the ego vehicle laterally (0.61m) and longitudinally (0.00m) which represents a very high risk of collision. The relative longitudinal velocity is -0.53 m/s indicating that the obstacle and the ego vehicle are moving closer at a slow speed.

Obstacle 30509 is located at a safe distance longitudinally (8.42m) and laterally (-15.02m) from the ego vehicle. The relative longitudinal velocity is -0.53 m/s, but given the distance, it does not pose an immediate threat.
