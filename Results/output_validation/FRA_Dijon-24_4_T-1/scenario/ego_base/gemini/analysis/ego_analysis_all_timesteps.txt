At t=10.7s, obstacle 30504 is to the left of the ego vehicle, longitudinally aligned (0.00m longitudinal distance) and laterally separated by 0.61m.  It has a small negative relative longitudinal velocity (-0.53 m/s) meaning it and the ego are almost stationary relative to each other or moving very slowly in the same overall direction. The lateral acceleration is minor.  This obstacle does not pose a collision risk in the next timestep.

Obstacle 30509 is in the front-right, at a longitudinal distance of 8.42m and lateral distance of -15.02m.  Its longitudinal relative velocity is -0.53 m/s, indicating it's moving closer longitudinally to the ego vehicle, though relatively slowly.  The lateral relative motion is negligible.  Given the distances and relatively slow velocities, this obstacle is not a collision risk in the immediate next timestep.
