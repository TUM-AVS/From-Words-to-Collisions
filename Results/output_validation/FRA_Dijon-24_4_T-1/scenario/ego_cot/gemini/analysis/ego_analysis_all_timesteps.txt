### Safety analysis for timestep 9.8s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:
- **Obstacle ID:** 30504
- **Distance Risk reason:** The obstacle has 0 longitudinal and lateral distance indicating an overlap with the ego vehicle.  This is a critical situation.
- **Distance safety score:** 0
- **Time Risk reason:**  With 0 distance and negative longitudinal velocity, a collision is imminent.
- **Time safety score:** 0
- **Overall Risk score:** 0

- **Obstacle ID:** 30509
- **Distance Risk reason:** The obstacle is at a diagonal distance (9.51m longitudinal and lateral), which poses a moderate risk considering it's approaching the ego vehicle.
- **Distance safety score:** 3
- **Time Risk reason:**  With -1.63 m/s closing velocity and 9.51m distance, TTC is approximately 5.8 seconds. This indicates a low risk currently but requires monitoring.
- **Time safety score:** 4
- **Overall Risk score:** 3


### Safety analysis for timestep 9.9s - 10.7s:
(Analysis follows the same pattern as 9.8s for both obstacles.  Key observations are outlined below).

**Obstacle 30504:** This obstacle consistently shows 0 distance and negative closing velocity throughout the provided timestamps, indicating a persistent collision state.  Therefore, the risk scores remain at 0 for both distance and time, leading to an overall risk score of 0.

**Obstacle 30509:** This obstacle continues to approach the ego vehicle. While the longitudinal distance decreases over time, the lateral distance remains similar. The TTC decreases with time but stays above 5 seconds.  The overall risk for this obstacle remains in the Medium to Low range (score 3-4) throughout the scenario.  This needs continuous monitoring, as the TTC will shrink if the ego car doesnâ€™t react.
