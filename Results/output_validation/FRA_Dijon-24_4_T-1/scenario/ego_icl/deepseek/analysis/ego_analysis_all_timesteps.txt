### Obstacle-by-Obstacle Analysis

#### Obstacle 30504 (Left of ego car)
- **Most Recent Timestep (10.7s):**
  - **Adjusted Distance:** Longitudinal 0.00 m, Lateral 0.61 m
  - **Relative Velocity:** Longitudinal -0.53 m/s (moving away), Lateral 0.00 m/s (no motion)
  - **Motion Description:** Exact longitudinal alignment, no lateral relative motion.
  - **Trajectory Analysis:**
    - Lateral distance has remained stable (~0.60-0.63 m) over the last 10 timesteps.
    - Longitudinal distance is consistently 0.00 m (exact alignment), but the obstacle is moving away longitudinally (negative relative velocity).
  - **TTC Calculation:**
    - Longitudinal: Not applicable (moving away).
    - Lateral: Not applicable (no relative motion).
  - **MDC Calculation:**
    - Current lateral distance is 0.61 m (stable, no closing motion).
    - Longitudinal alignment is exact but not closing.
    - MDC = 0.61 m (lateral distance).
  - **Risk Assessment:**
    - MDC = 0.61 m → **High Risk (2)** (0.5 < MDC ≤ 1.0 m).
    - TTC is not applicable (no closing motion).
    - **Overall Risk:** High Risk (2).

#### Obstacle 30509 (Front-right of ego car)
- **Most Recent Timestep (10.7s):**
  - **Adjusted Distance:** Longitudinal 8.42 m, Lateral -15.02 m
  - **Relative Velocity:** Longitudinal -0.53 m/s (approaching), Lateral 0.00 m/s (no motion)
  - **Motion Description:** Driving toward ego car longitudinally, no lateral relative motion.
  - **Trajectory Analysis:**
    - Longitudinal distance is decreasing (from 9.51 m at 9.8s to 8.42 m at 10.7s).
    - Lateral distance is stable (~-15.0 m, no closing motion).
  - **TTC Calculation:**
    - Longitudinal: TTC = 8.42 m / 0.53 m/s ≈ 15.89 s (no risk).
    - Lateral: Not applicable (no relative motion).
  - **MDC Calculation:**
    - Lateral distance is large (15.02 m) and stable.
    - Longitudinal distance is decreasing but still large (8.42 m).
    - MDC = min(8.42, 15.02) = 8.42 m.
  - **Risk Assessment:**
    - MDC = 8.42 m → **No Risk (5)** (MDC > 5.0 m).
    - TTC = 15.89 s → **No Risk (5)** (TTC > 5.0 s).
    - **Overall Risk:** No Risk (5).

### Collision Scenario Determination
- Neither obstacle has a risk score of 0 (collision) or 1 (extreme risk).
- Obstacle 30504 is at High Risk (2), but this does not meet the threshold for a collision scenario.
- Obstacle 30509 is at No Risk (5).
