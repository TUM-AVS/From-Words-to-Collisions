**Obstacle 30504 Analysis:**

* **Trajectory:** This obstacle has maintained exact longitudinal alignment with the ego vehicle across all timesteps, indicating it is likely in the adjacent lane. The lateral distance has remained relatively constant around 0.6m.  The relative longitudinal velocity is negative and decreasing in magnitude, suggesting the obstacle is slightly slower than the ego vehicle but the speed difference is reducing.

* **TTC (Longitudinal):** Not applicable due to negative relative velocity. However, since longitudinal distance is consistently 0, this metric is not the primary concern for side-by-side alignment cases.

* **TTC (Lateral):** Not applicable since lateral relative velocity is 0 m/s.

* **MDC:** Approximately 0.61m (lateral distance).

* **Risk Assessment:**
    * Longitudinal: No risk (stable longitudinal alignment at 0m, slight negative relative velocity implies no imminent longitudinal collision).
    * Lateral: Medium Risk (consistent lateral distance of ~0.6m falls within the Medium risk range).
    * Overall: Medium Risk (3) due to lateral proximity.

**Obstacle 30509 Analysis:**

* **Trajectory:** This obstacle is in front and to the right of the ego vehicle.  The longitudinal distance is decreasing across timesteps, indicating the ego vehicle is approaching this obstacle.  The lateral distance remains fairly constant around -15m.  The relative longitudinal velocity is negative, meaning the obstacle is moving slower than the ego vehicle, or possibly even in reverse, relatively speaking.

* **TTC (Longitudinal):** Distance: 8.42m, Relative Velocity: -0.53 m/s. TTC is not applicable since relative velocity is negative.

* **TTC (Lateral):** Not applicable as lateral relative velocity is 0 m/s.

* **MDC:** Approximately 8.42m (longitudinal distance is the primary concern as lateral distance remains > 15m)

* **Risk Assessment:**
    * Longitudinal: No Risk (large longitudinal distance with negative relative velocity indicating divergence).
    * Lateral: No Risk (large lateral distance and no lateral relative motion).
    * Overall: No Risk (5)

**Collision Scenario Determination:**

This is NOT a collision scenario. Neither obstacle presents an Extreme Risk (1) or Collision Risk (0).
