### Analysis for Timestep 10.7 seconds

#### Obstacle 30504:
- **Position**: Left of the ego vehicle
- **Adjusted Distances**: Longitudinal = 0.00 m, Lateral = 0.61 m
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal = -0.53 m/s, Lateral = 0.00 m/s
- **Relative Acceleration**: Longitudinal = -0.01 m/s², Lateral = 0.47 m/s²
- **Motion Description**: Exact longitudinal alignment, no lateral relative motion

**Trajectory Analysis**:
- Across the timesteps, the lateral distance varies slightly but remains close (around 0.60 - 0.63 m), indicating minimal lateral motion with stability around 0.60 m in recent timesteps.
- No longitudinal distance, indicating a side-by-side alignment with no relative lateral motion.

**TTC Calculations**:
- Longitudinal: Since the longitudinal distance is 0.00 m and the relative velocity is towards ego (-0.53 m/s), they are aligned side-by-side. Not a significant collision risk due to stable lateral distance.
- Lateral: No relative lateral velocity; thus, no collision risk based on lateral movement because the separation is stable around 0.60 m.

**MDC Calculations**:
- MDC in lateral direction is 0.61 m (current adjusted distance).

**Risk Score**:
- Medium Risk (3): Based on stable lateral distance > 0.5 m but < 1.0 m and no active closing velocity.

#### Obstacle 30509:
- **Position**: Front-right of the ego vehicle
- **Adjusted Distances**: Longitudinal = 8.42 m, Lateral = -15.02 m
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal = -0.53 m/s, Lateral = 0.00 m/s
- **Relative Acceleration**: Longitudinal = -0.01 m/s², Lateral = 0.47 m/s²
- **Motion Description**: Obstacle is moving toward the ego vehicle longitudinally with no lateral change

**Trajectory Analysis**:
- Longitudinally moving towards the ego at a slow rate indicated by a steady decrease in distance over time.
- Lateral distance remains far, showing no intent for lateral closure.

**TTC Calculations**:
- Longitudinal = 8.42 m / 0.53 m/s ≈ 15.89 seconds, indicating no immediate collision threat based on longitudinal trajectory.
- Lateral is not relevant due to stable trajectory and relative motion along the linear path.

**MDC Calculations**:
- MDC longitudinally is greater than immediate threshold limits, indicating no immediate intersection threat.

**Risk Score**:
- No Risk (5): Both TTC and MDC indicate that there's no immediate threat as the obstacle is maintaining safe distances.

### Conclusion
- This is NOT a collision scenario. Both obstacles maintain sufficient distances to avoid immediate collision risks.
