### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
    - Obstacle ID: 30504
    - Relative Direction: Left
    - Distance Risk Reason: The obstacle is very close laterally (0.61m) and longitudinally aligned (0.00m) with the ego vehicle, indicating a high risk of collision. This has been consistent over the past 10 timesteps.
    - Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 0
    - Lateral Distance Safety Score: 1
    - Overall Distance Safety Score: 1.0
    - Time Risk Reason:  Longitudinal TTC is 0.00, showing immediate longitudinal collision risk, despite no lateral relative movement (TTClat = inf). This has persisted over the past timesteps.
    - Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 0
    - Lateral Time Safety Score: 5
    - Overall Time Safety Score: 5.0
    - Overall Risk Score: 3

    - Obstacle ID: 30509
    - Relative Direction: Front-right
    - Distance Risk Reason:  The obstacle is longitudinally far (8.42m) and laterally sufficiently separated (-15.02m), representing low longitudinal risk and no lateral risk. The obstacle has been approaching longitudinally over the timesteps.
    - Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 5
    - Lateral Distance Safety Score: 5
    - Overall Distance Safety Score: 5.0
    - Time Risk Reason:  The obstacle is approaching longitudinally (TTClong = 15.88s) but there's no lateral relative motion (TTClat = inf). TTClong initially decreased then started increasing, suggesting the obstacle might be slowing down or the ego vehicle is accelerating.
    - Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 5
    - Lateral Time Safety Score: 5
    - Overall Time Safety Score: 5.0
    - Overall Risk Score: 5
