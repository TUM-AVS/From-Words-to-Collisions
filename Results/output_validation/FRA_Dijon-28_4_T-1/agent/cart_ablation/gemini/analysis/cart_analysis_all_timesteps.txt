Obstacle 30530 shows a decreasing y-coordinate, moving towards the Ego vehicle's y-coordinate, but its x-coordinate suggests it's in a different lane and diverging away from the Ego vehicle.  Given the lateral separation and diverging trajectories, a collision is unlikely. Risk score for 30530: 4 (Low Risk).

Obstacle 30532 is in the same lane as Ego and has a higher y-coordinate (meaning it is ahead of the Ego vehicle). Although the velocity of Obstacle 30532 is consistently higher than the Ego vehicle, the distance between them suggests no immediate risk. Risk score for 30532: 3 (Medium Risk)

Obstacle 30537, similar to 30532, is also ahead of the ego-vehicle in the same lanelet. Its behavior isnâ€™t indicative of any immediate collision risk, though its proximity warrants monitoring. Risk score for 30537: 3 (Medium Risk)

Obstacle 30538 is located in a different lanelet and maintains a significant lateral distance from the Ego vehicle. The trajectories suggest no risk of collision. Risk score for 30538: 5 (Negligible risk)

Obstacle 30539 is located in a different lanelet. The data suggests diverging trajectories, indicating minimal collision risk. Risk score for 30539: 4 (Low risk)
