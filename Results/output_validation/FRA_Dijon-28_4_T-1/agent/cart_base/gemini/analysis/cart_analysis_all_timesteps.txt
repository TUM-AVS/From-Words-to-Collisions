Obstacle 30530: This obstacle starts relatively far from the ego vehicle and in a different lane (367 vs 84). While its velocity is higher than the ego vehicle's, its trajectory doesn't appear to intersect with the ego vehicle's path in the near future. The change in lanelet to 1038 further reduces risk.  Risk score: 5 (Negligible Risk)

Obstacle 30532: This obstacle is in the same lane as the ego vehicle (84) and relatively close.  It is approaching the ego vehicle from behind, as its initial Y coordinate is less negative than the ego's.  Although its velocity is greater than the ego vehicle's, the ego vehicle is decelerating significantly.  While a collision isn't imminent within the predicted timeframe, the closing distance and velocity difference present a potential high risk if the ego continues to decelerate or if the obstacle accelerates.  Risk score: 2 (High Risk)


Obstacle 30537: This obstacle is also in the same lane as the ego vehicle (84) and even closer than 30532. Its initial Y-coordinate is significantly less negative than the ego's. It is also approaching the ego vehicle from behind. It's moving faster than the ego vehicle. The distance between them is decreasing. This represents a high risk of collision in the near future. Risk score: 2 (High Risk)


Obstacle 30538: This obstacle is in a different lane (461) and its trajectory doesn't appear to intersect with the ego vehicle's. Risk score: 5 (Negligible Risk)

Obstacle 30539: This obstacle is in a different lane (1133) and its trajectory doesn't appear to intersect with the ego vehicle's. Risk score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
