### Analysis

In analyzing the data, we will consider the final timestep at 1.9 seconds and examine the trajectory, speed, and relative movement of each obstacle compared to the ego vehicle. Here's a breakdown:

1. **Ego Vehicle**: 

   - Position: (24.5962, -387.1472)
   - Velocity: 0.1795 m/s
   - Acceleration: -0.1281 m/sÂ²
   - Located in lanelet 84.0
   
2. **Obstacle: 30530** 

   - Position: (34.6041, -390.8883), Lanelet: 1038.0 
   - Velocity: 7.7684 m/s
   - Continues to move away along a trajectory not intersecting with the ego vehicle. Low risk due to differing lane.

3. **Obstacle: 30532** 

   - Position: (22.0969, -382.4673), Lanelet: 84.0 
   - Velocity: 4.0717 m/s
   - Located in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle. The relative motion suggests it's closing in on the ego vehicle.
   - Due to proximity and closing speed, this represents **High Risk (2)**.

4. **Obstacle: 30537** 

   - Position: (16.7102, -372.321), Lanelet: 84.0
   - Velocity: 3.9217 m/s
   - Like obstacle 30532, it also shares the same lanelet but more distance from the ego vehicle. Nonetheless, its speed and course suggest urgency.

5. **Obstacle: 30538** 

   - Position: (15.1928, -406.9485), Lanelet: 461.0
   - Velocity: 6.091 m/s
   - Located in a different lanelet, moving parallel but safely distanced. Negligible risk as no immediate collision course.

6. **Obstacle: 30539** 

   - Position: (28.1126, -399.6193), Lanelet: 1133.0
   - Velocity: 5.114 m/s
   - Different lanelet and far enough. No immediate danger.

### Summary

Based on the analysis, obstacles 30532 and 30537 present the highest risk due to their proximity and speed relative to the ego vehicle, and sharing the same lanelet. Obstacle 30532 is of particular concern due to its velocity and proximity.

### JSON Output

```json
{
    "CollisionObstacles": [],
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "30532",
        "OverallRiskScore": 2
    },
    "HighRiskObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "30537",
        "OverallRiskScore": 2
    }
}
```

This output highlights that while no collision is imminent (no score of 0 or 1), obstacle 30532 and 30537 are realistic threats, requiring urgent response mechanisms to ensure safety.
