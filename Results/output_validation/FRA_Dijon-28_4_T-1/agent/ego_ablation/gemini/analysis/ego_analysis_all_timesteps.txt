Here's the collision analysis for the provided scenario focusing on the last time step (1.9 seconds):

**Obstacle 30530 (Front-Left):** This obstacle is at a longitudinal distance of 3.42m and a lateral distance of 5.55m. While the lateral distance is not immediately concerning, the longitudinal distance is getting closer to a medium risk and requires attention, its longitudinal velocity indicates it is moving towards the ego vehicle.  The combined distance and closing velocity warrant a risk score of 3(Medium Risk).

**Obstacle 30532 (Behind):** This obstacle is only 0.8m behind the ego vehicle and closing with a speed of 3.89 m/s. This represents a very high risk of collision.  Given the MDC and TTC, the risk score is 2 (High Risk).

**Obstacle 30537 (Behind):** At -12.28m behind the ego vehicle and moving forward, this obstacle presents minimal risk with ample time to react. Risk score 5 (Negligible Risk).

**Obstacle 30538 (Front-Right):** This obstacle is relatively far from the ego vehicle with a longitudinal distance of 8.74m and a lateral distance of -15.85m. The motion suggests it is not on a direct collision course. Risk score 5 (Negligible Risk).

**Obstacle 30539 (Front-Right):** The longitudinal distance to this obstacle is 8.18m and the lateral distance -1.01m, with lateral movement towards the ego vehicle from the right. Overall this obstacle has a risk score of 3 (Medium Risk), as the combined longitudinal and lateral distances present a manageable risk given the obstacle is driving towards the ego car both longitudinally and laterally.
