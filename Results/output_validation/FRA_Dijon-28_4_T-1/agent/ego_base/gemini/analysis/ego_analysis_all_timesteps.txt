Obstacle 30530: Front-left, closing longitudinally and laterally. The short distance (3.42m longitudinal, 5.55m lateral) and the relatively high closing speed (-3.33 m/s longitudinal, -7.10 m/s lateral) suggest a high risk. Risk score 2.

Obstacle 30532: Behind, very close longitudinally (-0.80m) and approaching rapidly (3.89 m/s). This represents an extreme risk of a rear-end collision. Risk score 1.

Obstacle 30537: Behind, moderate longitudinal distance (-12.28m) and approaching (3.74 m/s).  While closing, the distance provides some buffer. Risk score 3.

Obstacle 30538: Front-right, moderate longitudinal distance (8.74m) and moderate lateral closing speed (6.09 m/s). The lateral motion needs monitoring, but the current state is medium risk. Risk score 3.

Obstacle 30539: Front-right, moderate longitudinal distance (8.18m) but a small lateral distance (-1.01m) combined with significant lateral speed (5.11 m/s) implies high risk. Risk score 2.


Risk Levels:
0: Collision - Physical contact occurred or unavoidable
1: Extreme Risk - Immediate collision likely
2: High Risk - Close to collision, needs quick action
3: Medium Risk - Manageable with proper reaction
4: Low Risk - Minimal risk, sufficient time to react
5: Negligible Risk - No significant risk
