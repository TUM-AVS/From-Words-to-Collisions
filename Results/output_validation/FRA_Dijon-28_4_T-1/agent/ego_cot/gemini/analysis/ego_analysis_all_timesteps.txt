### Safety analysis for timestep 1.9 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

**Assumptions and Calculations:**

Since the provided scenario context lacks vehicle dimensions, I'll assume a generic vehicle size of 1.8 meters wide and 4.5 meters long for illustrative purposes in MDC calculations.  The lack of precise ego vehicle motion information complicates accurate TTC calculation.  I will infer TTC based on relative velocities and distances, acknowledging these are approximations.  A proper TTC calculation requires absolute velocity and acceleration data for both ego and obstacles.

For adjusted distance calculations, we'll consider vehicle size. For simplification, we will use Euclidean distance using the longitudinal and lateral distances and subtract the corresponding vehicle dimensions (length for longitudinal and width for lateral). Since both ego vehicle and obstacles are considered to have identical size, we will subtract a value of half the vehicle's corresponding dimension.

Example:
- `adjusted_d_long` = sqrt(DTClong^2 + DTClat^2) - (ego_length/2 + obstacle_length/2).
- `adjusted_d_lat` = sqrt(DTClong^2 + DTClat^2) - (ego_width/2 + obstacle_width/2).

Since the scenario context provides no information about the relative trajectories after the last timestep (1.9 seconds), I'll consider relative velocities of that timestep in the risk assessment.

**Calculated adjusted distances at 1.9 seconds:**

- **Obstacle 30530:** sqrt(3.42^2 + 3.42^2) - (4.5/2 + 4.5/2) and sqrt(3.42^2 + 3.42^2) - (1.8/2+1.8/2) = 0.27m long and 0.27m lat
- **Obstacle 30532:** sqrt(-0.8^2 + -0.8^2) - (4.5/2 + 4.5/2) and sqrt(-0.8^2 + -0.8^2) - (1.8/2+1.8/2) = -3.36m long and -3.36m lat
- **Obstacle 30537:**  sqrt(-12.28^2 + -12.28^2) - (4.5/2 + 4.5/2) and sqrt(-12.28^2 + -12.28^2) - (1.8/2+1.8/2) = 12.89m long and 12.89m lat
- **Obstacle 30538:** sqrt(8.74^2 + 8.74^2) - (4.5/2 + 4.5/2) and sqrt(8.74^2 + 8.74^2) - (1.8/2+1.8/2) = 7.81m long and 7.81m lat
- **Obstacle 30539:** sqrt(8.18^2 + 8.18^2) - (4.5/2 + 4.5/2) and sqrt(8.18^2 + 8.18^2) - (1.8/2+1.8/2) = 7.24m long and 7.24m lat
