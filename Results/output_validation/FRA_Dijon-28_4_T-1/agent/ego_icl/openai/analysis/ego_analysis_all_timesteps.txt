### Obstacle Analysis

#### Obstacle 30530 (Front-left)
- **Adjusted Distances at 1.9s**: Longitudinal (4.06m), Lateral (5.55m)
- **Relative Velocities**: Longitudinal (-3.33 m/s), Lateral (-7.10 m/s)
- **Trajectory**: Approaching from front-left with closing velocities in both dimensions.

**TTC Calculation**:
- Longitudinal: |TTC| = 4.06 / 3.33 ≈ 1.22 seconds
- Lateral: |TTC| = 5.55 / 7.10 ≈ 0.78 seconds

**MDC Analysis**:
- Given both distances are decreasing, the smaller lateral distance is emphasized.
- Both directions show a high convergence.

**Trajectory and Risk Assessment**:
- Lateral TTC is particularly concerning which is under 1 second.
- With closing speed in both components, further decreases in distance pose risk.
- Risk Score: 2 (High Risk)

#### Obstacle 30532 (Behind)
- **Adjusted Distances at 1.9s**: Longitudinal (-0.80m), Lateral (0.00m)
- **Relative Velocities**: Longitudinal (3.89 m/s)

**TTC Calculation**:
- Longitudinal: |TTC| = 0.80 / 3.89 ≈ 0.21 seconds 

**MDC Analysis**:
- Alignment with decreasing longitudinal distance at the current velocity suggests high collision risk.

**Trajectory and Risk Assessment**:
- The longitudinal distance decrease is rapid with potential collision course.
- Risk Score: 1 (Extreme Risk)

#### Obstacle 30537 (Behind)
- **Adjusted Distances at 1.9s**: Longitudinal (-12.28m), Lateral (0.00m)
- **Relative Velocities**: Longitudinal (3.74 m/s)

**TTC Calculation**:
- Longitudinal: |TTC| = 12.28 / 3.74 ≈ 3.28 seconds 

**MDC Analysis**:
- Significant distance remains, thus deemed manageable with timely action.

**Trajectory and Risk Assessment**:
- Given the greater distance, the risk is medium unless rapid changes occur.
- Risk Score: 3 (Medium Risk)

#### Obstacle 30538 (Front-right)
- **Adjusted Distances at 1.9s**: Longitudinal (8.74m), Lateral (-15.85m)
- **Relative Velocities**: Longitudinal (-0.42 m/s), Lateral (6.09 m/s)

**TTC Calculation**:
- Longitudinal: Unlimited due to negative velocity (increases distance)
- Lateral remains non-critical

**MDC Analysis**:
- Path suggests no intersecting course for collision.
- Distances are diverging rather than converging significantly.

**Trajectory and Risk Assessment**:
- Negligible risk based on current positions and velocities.
- Risk Score: 5 (Negligible Risk)

#### Obstacle 30539 (Front-right)
- **Adjusted Distances at 1.9s**: Longitudinal (8.18m), Lateral (-1.01m)
- **Relative Velocities**: Longitudinal (-0.36 m/s), Lateral (5.11 m/s)

**TTC Calculation**:
- Longitudinal: Unlimited due to negative velocity
- Lateral TTC: |TTC| = 1.01 / 5.11 ≈ 0.20 seconds

**MDC Analysis**:
- Lateral distance critical and rapidly decreasing formatting collision trajectory.

**Trajectory and Risk Assessment**:
- Predominantly lateral movement with very short MDC.
- Risk Score: 1 (Extreme Risk)
