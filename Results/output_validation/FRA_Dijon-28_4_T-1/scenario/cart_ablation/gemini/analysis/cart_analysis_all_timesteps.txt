At t=2.1s, ego vehicle (30531.0) is at (24.6127, -387.179) in lanelet 84.0.  Let's analyze the closest obstacles:

* **Obstacle 30529.0:** This obstacle is in the same lanelet as ego (84.0), at (10.8031, -361.1945). While the y-coordinate shows some distance, the obstacle's x-position and velocity (5.1622) suggest it is approaching ego rapidly from behind.  This obstacle is catching up to the ego vehicle and represents a possible collision risk if the ego vehicle were to decelerate or stop suddenly. Further investigation is needed to determine if lane changes are possible for either vehicle in the near future to mitigate the risk. Given the closing speed, I classify this as an *Extreme Risk (1)*.

* **Obstacle 30532.0:** Positioned at (22.4995, -383.2256), also in lanelet 84.0.  Its x-coordinate is close to ego's, and while it's slightly ahead, the closing rate needs consideration due to the velocity difference and the ego vehicle's deceleration. Its trajectory suggests it might cut in front of the ego vehicle in the coming seconds, potentially increasing risk of collision. This is a *High Risk (2)* situation.

* **Obstacle 30537.0:** Located at (17.0904, -373.0371) in lanelet 84.0. This obstacle is ahead of both the ego vehicle and Obstacle 30532.0. This obstacle represents a *Medium Risk (3)* due to the its proximity to the ego vehicle and obstacle 30532.0, although the distances are not as critical compared to the other obstacles. It can be classified as medium risk instead of low risk to account for the complex interactions between the vehicles in the same lane and to accommodate for potential sudden braking or lane changes.


Other obstacles (30530.0, 30538.0, and 30539.0) are in different lanelets and pose no immediate threat.

Obstacle 30532.0 is also a high risk due to its proximity and potential to cut in front of ego. Obstacle 30537.0 represents a medium-level risk due to close proximity and its location between the ego and other closer obstacles."
