At t=2.1s, Ego is in lanelet 84.0 at (24.61, -387.18) with a velocity of 0.14 m/s.

Obstacle 30529 is in the same lanelet as Ego at (10.80, -361.19) with a velocity of 5.16 m/s.  Given its position and velocity, and Ego's low velocity, this obstacle poses a high risk of collision in the near future if Ego does not accelerate or if Obstacle 30529 does not decelerate significantly.

Obstacle 30532 is also in lanelet 84.0 at (22.50, -383.23) with a velocity of 4.44 m/s. This represents a significant risk. The y-coordinate difference is smaller than with Obstacle 30529, and the x-coordinate is approaching Ego's.  The relatively high velocity further elevates the risk. While not an immediate collision, a risk score of 1 (Extreme Risk) seems warranted given the trajectories and velocities observed in previous timesteps.

Obstacle 30537 is in lanelet 84.0 at (17.09, -373.04) with a velocity of 4.12 m/s. This obstacle is also rapidly approaching Ego and poses a high risk.  The combination of closing distance and speed makes an eventual collision likely unless evasive action is taken.

Other obstacles are in different lanelets and pose less immediate risk at this timestep.

        "Reasoning": "Obstacle 30532 poses an extreme risk of collision in the very near future due to its high closing velocity and proximity to Ego in the same lanelet. Obstacles 30529 and 30537 also present high risks, but 30532's trajectory and velocity make it the most imminent threat at t=2.1s."
