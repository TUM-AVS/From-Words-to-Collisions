- Distance Risk reason: Different lanelet; moving away laterally.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: No time risk due to lateral separation.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 30532.0
- Distance Risk reason: Same lanelet; ahead of ego; getting further away.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Moving faster than ego; but increasing distance.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- Obstacle ID: 30537.0
- Distance Risk reason: Same lanelet; ahead of ego; getting further away.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Moving faster than ego, but increasing distance.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- Obstacle ID: 30538.0
- Distance Risk reason: Different lanelet; no immediate risk.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: No time risk due to lane separation.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 30539.0
- Distance Risk reason: Different lanelet; no immediate risk.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: No time risk due to lane separation.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
Obstacle 30529.0 presents the highest risk. While not an immediate collision, its rapid approach in the same lanelet necessitates close monitoring. No other obstacles pose a significant risk at this timestep due to lane separation or increasing distance from the ego vehicle.

### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
  "CollisionObstacles": null,
  "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {
    "ObstacleID": "30529.0",
    "OverallRiskScore": 2
  },
  "ScenarioAnalysis": {
    "IsCollisionScenario": false,
    "Reasoning": "No obstacle has a risk score of 0, indicating no immediate collision. However, obstacle 30529.0 has a risk score of 2 (High Risk) due to its close proximity, same lanelet as ego, and high closing velocity. This requires attention."
  }
