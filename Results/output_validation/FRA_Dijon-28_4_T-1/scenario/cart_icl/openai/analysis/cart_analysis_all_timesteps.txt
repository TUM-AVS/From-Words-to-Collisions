### Obstacle Analysis:

#### Obstacle ID: 30529.0
- **Distance Risk reason:** This obstacle has recently entered the area. It has been accelerating steadily, but it is still far from the ego vehicle in terms of distance.
- **Distance safety score:** 4
- **Time Risk reason:** The relative velocity and the direction do not indicate an immediate approach towards the ego.
- **Time safety score:** 4
- **Overall Risk score:** 4

#### Obstacle ID: 30530.0
- **Distance Risk reason:** This obstacle is on a different lanelet trajectory than the ego vehicle. It has shown consistent velocity, which suggests it is moving parallel past the ego vehicle.
- **Distance safety score:** 4
- **Time Risk reason:** The obstacle has a stable velocity and moves away slightly, implying a low likelihood of collision.
- **Time safety score:** 4
- **Overall Risk score:** 4

#### Obstacle ID: 30532.0
- **Distance Risk reason:** The obstacle is in the same lanelet and has been accelerating towards the ego's position. However, it is some distance away.
- **Distance safety score:** 3
- **Time Risk reason:** Given the acceleration and velocity, the obstacle could close the gap if the trends continue.
- **Time safety score:** 3
- **Overall Risk score:** 3

#### Obstacle ID: 30537.0
- **Distance Risk reason:** This obstacle is in the same lane and relatively close to the ego vehicle, with steady approach movement.
- **Distance safety score:** 3
- **Time Risk reason:** The obstacle is accelerating marginally towards the ego. While not immediately threatening, trends show decreasing separation.
- **Time safety score:** 3
- **Overall Risk score:** 3

#### Obstacle ID: 30538.0
- **Distance Risk reason:** The position and trajectory show it is moving in a largely parallel direction without heading into the egoâ€™s path.
- **Distance safety score:** 4
- **Time Risk reason:** Velocity trends and acceleration indicate stable conditions with no direct trajectory towards the ego vehicle.
- **Time safety score:** 4
- **Overall Risk score:** 4

#### Obstacle ID: 30539.0
- **Distance Risk reason:** It remains a safe distance away, with orientation and velocity suggesting it's on a separate path.
- **Distance safety score:** 4
- **Time Risk reason:** This obstacle's characteristics show no significant risk to the ego vehicle from historical data.
- **Time safety score:** 4
- **Overall Risk score:** 4

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
After evaluating all obstacles based on proximity, relative motion, and trajectory over the last few timesteps, none of the obstacles pose an extreme or collision risk. Each maintains a separate trajectory or safe pace relative to the ego's position.
