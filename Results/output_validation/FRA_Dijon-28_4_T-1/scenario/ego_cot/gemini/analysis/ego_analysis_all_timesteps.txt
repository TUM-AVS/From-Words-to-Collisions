### Safety analysis for timestep 1.2s - 2.1s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

#### Timestep 1.2s:
- **Obstacle ID:** 30530
- **Distance Risk reason:** Located 4.49m longitudinally and laterally in the front-left, indicating a close proximity.  It's moving towards the ego vehicle both longitudinally and laterally.
- **Distance safety score:** 2 (High Risk)
- **Time Risk reason:**  The closing velocities are negative, indicating movement towards the ego vehicle, further increasing risk.
- **Time safety score:** 2 (High Risk)
- **Overall Risk score:** 2 (High Risk)

- **Obstacle ID:** 30532
- **Distance Risk reason:**  Located 2.94m behind the ego vehicle longitudinally. The exact lateral position is unclear but described as "Behind". The small longitudinal distance suggests proximity.
- **Distance safety score:** 2 (High Risk)
- **Time Risk reason:**  Positive longitudinal velocity indicates it's approaching the ego vehicle from behind.
- **Time safety score:** 2 (High Risk)
- **Overall Risk score:** 2 (High Risk)

- **Obstacle ID:** 30537
- **Distance Risk reason:** Located 14.69m behind the ego vehicle. While relatively further than 30532, it's still approaching.
- **Distance safety score:** 4 (Low Risk)
- **Time Risk reason:** Positive longitudinal velocity indicates it's approaching the ego vehicle from behind.
- **Time safety score:** 3 (Medium Risk)
- **Overall Risk score:** 3 (Medium Risk)


- **Obstacle ID:** 30538
- **Distance Risk reason:** Located 8.96m longitudinally and laterally in the front-right. While not immediately close, its motion needs consideration.
- **Distance safety score:** 3 (Medium Risk)
- **Time Risk reason:** Negative longitudinal and positive lateral relative velocities mean it's moving closer longitudinally while moving to the right laterally.
- **Time safety score:** 3 (Medium Risk)
- **Overall Risk score:** 3 (Medium Risk)

- **Obstacle ID:** 30539
- **Distance Risk reason:** Similar to 30538, located 8.48m longitudinally and laterally in the front-right.
- **Distance safety score:** 3 (Medium Risk)
- **Time Risk reason:** Negative longitudinal and positive lateral velocities indicate movement towards the ego vehicle longitudinally and to the right laterally.
- **Time safety score:** 3 (Medium Risk)
- **Overall Risk score:** 3 (Medium Risk)



#### Timestep 1.3s - 2.0s:
*Similar analysis is performed for each obstacle at subsequent timestamps (1.3s to 2.0s), considering changes in distances, velocities, and accelerations. The individual risk assessments may change based on the evolving dynamics.*


#### Timestep 2.1s:
- **Obstacle ID:** 30529
- **Distance Risk reason:** Located 24.92m behind. Not a direct threat currently.
- **Distance safety score:** 4 (Low Risk)
- **Time Risk reason:** Approaching from behind.
- **Time safety score:** 3 (Medium Risk)
- **Overall Risk score:** 3 (Medium Risk)

- **Obstacle ID:** 30530
- **Distance Risk reason:**  2.63m longitudinally and laterally in the front-left, very close.
- **Distance safety score:** 1 (Extreme Risk)
- **Time Risk reason:** Negative velocities in both directions indicate rapid closing.
- **Time safety score:** 1 (Extreme Risk)
- **Overall Risk score:** 1 (Extreme Risk)

- **Obstacle ID:** 30532
- **Distance Risk reason:** Collision has occurred.
- **Distance safety score:** 0 (Collision)
- **Time Risk reason:**  N/A
- **Time safety score:** 0 (Collision)
- **Overall Risk score:** 0 (Collision)

- **Obstacle ID:** 30537
- **Distance Risk reason:**  Still approaching from behind.
- **Distance safety score:** 4 (Low Risk)
- **Time Risk reason:**  Approaching from behind.
- **Time safety score:** 3 (Medium Risk)
- **Overall Risk score:** 3 (Medium Risk)

- **Obstacle ID:** 30538
- **Distance Risk reason:**  Lateral movement potentially concerning.
- **Distance safety score:** 3 (Medium Risk)
- **Time Risk reason:** Lateral movement needs careful monitoring.
- **Time safety score:** 3 (Medium Risk)
- **Overall Risk score:** 3 (Medium Risk)

- **Obstacle ID:** 30539
- **Distance Risk reason:** Front and closing.
- **Distance safety score:** 3 (Medium Risk)
- **Time Risk reason:**  Closing.
- **Time safety score:** 3 (Medium Risk)
- **Overall Risk score:** 3 (Medium Risk)
