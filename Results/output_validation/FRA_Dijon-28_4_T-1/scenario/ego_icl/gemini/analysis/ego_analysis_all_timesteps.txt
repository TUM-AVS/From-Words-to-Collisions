* **Obstacle 30529 (Behind):** This obstacle is relatively far behind (-24.92m longitudinally) and although it's approaching (5.02 m/s), the lateral distance is 0.00m indicating it's in the same lane.  Given the distance, even with the closing velocity, there is no immediate risk.  Assuming constant velocity, TTC is approximately 24.92 / 5.02 = 4.96 seconds. Risk assessment: Low (4).

* **Obstacle 30530 (Front-Left):**  Located 2.63m longitudinally and 4.43m laterally from the ego vehicle. Both distances are decreasing across timesteps. The obstacle is approaching both longitudinally (-5.09 m/s) and laterally (-6.00 m/s). MDC is approximately 4.43m. TTC longitudinally is 2.63 / 5.09 = 0.52 seconds. TTC laterally is 4.43 / 6.00 = 0.74 seconds. Given the low longitudinal TTC and converging trajectories, this poses a high risk. Risk assessment: High (2).

* **Obstacle 30532 (Collision):**  The data shows longitudinal and lateral distances of 0.00m and motion description confirms an "Exact longitudinal alignment" and "Exact lateral alignment" at this timestep. The relative velocity is 4.30 m/s longitudinally, meaning it was approaching immediately before this timestep, which strongly suggests a collision has just occurred. Risk assessment: Collision (0).

* **Obstacle 30537 (Behind):**  Similar to Obstacle 30529, this obstacle is behind the ego vehicle (-11.51m longitudinally) and approaching (3.98 m/s) with 0.00m lateral distance.  The TTC is approximately 11.51 / 3.98 = 2.89 seconds. Risk assessment: Medium (3).

* **Obstacle 30538 (Front-Right):**  This obstacle is 8.59m longitudinally and -14.67m laterally from the ego vehicle, moving towards the ego longitudinally (-0.36 m/s) and away laterally (6.23 m/s). Given the substantial lateral distance and diverging lateral trajectory, the risk is low.  Longitudinal TTC is 8.59 / 0.36 = 23.86 seconds. Risk assessment: Low (4).

* **Obstacle 30539 (Front):** At 8.10m longitudinally and 0.00m laterally, this obstacle is directly ahead but at a safe distance. Although it is slightly approaching longitudinally (-0.31 m/s) and moving laterally (5.48 m/s), the trajectory indicates it's likely passing by.  Longitudinal TTC is approximately 8.1 / 0.31 = 26.13 seconds. Risk assessment: Low (4).


**Collision Scenario Determination:** Yes, this is a collision scenario because Obstacle 30532 shows a collision risk score of 0.
