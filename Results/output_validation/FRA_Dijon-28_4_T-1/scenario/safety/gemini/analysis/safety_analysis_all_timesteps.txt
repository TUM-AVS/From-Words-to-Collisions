### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 30529
- Relative Direction: Behind
- Distance Risk Reason: Obstacle is behind the ego vehicle at -24.92m longitudinally, which is a safe distance. Lateral distance is 0.00m suggesting perfect alignment, and DTC history shows the obstacle is approaching.
- Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 5
- Lateral Distance Safety Score: 5
- Overall Distance Safety Score: 5.0
- Time Risk Reason: While far, the TTClong of 4.96 indicates the approaching obstacle from behind requires monitoring over time. TTClat is 0 indicating perfect lateral alignment with no lateral movement.
- Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 4
- Lateral Time Safety Score: 5
- Overall Time Safety Score: 4.0
- Overall Risk Score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 30530
- Relative Direction: Front-left
- Distance Risk Reason: The obstacle is at 2.63m longitudinally and 4.43m laterally which presents a medium longitudinal risk and a low lateral risk. The history shows both DTClong and DTClat decreasing meaning the obstacle is approaching.
- Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 3
- Lateral Distance Safety Score: 4
- Overall Distance Safety Score: 3.5
- Time Risk Reason: TTClong is extremely low at 0.52, indicating high risk of longitudinal collision. TTClat of 0.74 also presents a high risk. History shows TTC decreasing for both implying the obstacle is getting closer.
- Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 1
- Lateral Time Safety Score: 2
- Overall Time Safety Score: 1.5
- Overall Risk Score: 3

- Obstacle ID: 30532
- Relative Direction: Collision
- Distance Risk Reason: Both DTClong and DTClat are 0, indicating a collision has occurred.
- Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 0
- Lateral Distance Safety Score: 0
- Overall Distance Safety Score: 0.0
- Time Risk Reason: Both TTClong and TTClat are 0, confirming collision at this timestep.
- Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 0
- Lateral Time Safety Score: 0
- Overall Time Safety Score: 0.0
- Overall Risk Score: 0

- Obstacle ID: 30537
- Relative Direction: Behind
- Distance Risk Reason: Located -11.51m behind, the obstacle poses no longitudinal distance risk. Lateral distance is 0.00m with the obstacle approaching from behind over the past timesteps.
- Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 5
- Lateral Distance Safety Score: 5
- Overall Distance Safety Score: 5.0
- Time Risk Reason: TTClong is 2.89, posing a medium risk, while TTClat remains 0.00 due to direct alignment.
- Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 3
- Lateral Time Safety Score: 5
- Overall Time Safety Score: 3.0
- Overall Risk Score: 4

- Obstacle ID: 30538
- Relative Direction: Front-right
- Distance Risk Reason: DTClong is 8.59m and DTClat is -14.67m, posing no distance risk in either direction. History indicates consistent safe distances.
- Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 5
- Lateral Distance Safety Score: 5
- Overall Distance Safety Score: 5.0
- Time Risk Reason: Both TTClong (24.11s) and TTClat (2.36s) are high, indicating no immediate time-related collision risk.
- Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 5
- Lateral Time Safety Score: 3
- Overall Time Safety Score: 4.0
- Overall Risk Score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 30539
- Relative Direction: Front
- Distance Risk Reason: Located 8.10m in front with 0.00m lateral offset, this presents no immediate distance risk. DTC values remained safe and haven't decreased significantly over previous timesteps.
- Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 5
- Lateral Distance Safety Score: 5
- Overall Distance Safety Score: 5.0
- Time Risk Reason: TTClong (26.15) indicates no longitudinal collision risk, TTClat is 0 indicating perfect lateral alignment or unknown lateral motion of the obstacle relative to ego. 
- Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 5
- Lateral Time Safety Score: 5
- Overall Time Safety Score: 5.0
- Overall Risk Score: 5
