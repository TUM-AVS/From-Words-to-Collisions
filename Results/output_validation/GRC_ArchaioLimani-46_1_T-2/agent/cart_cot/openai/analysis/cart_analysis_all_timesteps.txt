At the latest timestep (5.1 seconds), the given positions, velocities, and orientations suggest the following risk analysis:

### Analysis:

1. **Obstacle 10:**
   - **Position:** (-10.1676, -4.516)
   - **Velocity:** 0.0 (stationary)
   - **There is no relative motion towards the ego vehicle, hence it poses no immediate threat.**
   
2. **Obstacle 12:**
   - **Position:** (-17.5952, -6.6751)
   - **Velocity:** 0.2536
   - **Acceleration:** -0.1937
   - **The obstacle is moving very slowly, with a decreasing velocity trend and negative acceleration. It's far behind in the lane and poses no immediate threat.**

3. **Obstacle 21:**
   - **Position:** (-38.1452, -12.6487)
   - **Velocity:** 3.624
   - **Acceleration:** -0.9126
   - **This vehicle is moving with a significant velocity, although it is also decelerating. Its position suggests it's ahead of the ego vehicle. Given its trajectory, it's on the same lane, moving slightly slower but still maintaining a safe distance.**

### Risk Evaluation:

- **Obstacle 10:** It remains stationary and poses no risk to the ego vehicle. **Risk Level: 5 (Negligible Risk)**
- **Obstacle 12:** Given it's far behind and moving very slowly, it does not present a meaningful risk. **Risk Level: 5 (Negligible Risk)**
- **Obstacle 21:** Despite its motion dynamics, it maintains a reasonable distance, moving slower than the ego vehicle but positioned in front. **Risk Level: 4 (Low Risk)**

No vehicles collided or were at imminent risk of collision with these parameters.
