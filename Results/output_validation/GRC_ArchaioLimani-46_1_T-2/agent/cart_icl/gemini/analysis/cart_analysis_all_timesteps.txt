Obstacle 21 is approaching the ego vehicle from behind at high speed.  At the last time step, the relative longitudinal velocity is approximately 1.8 m/s and the relative distance is about 6.8 meters. This means a very short TTC. Although there is a lateral distance, the high closing speed raises the risk level. Obstacle 12 is much slower and further away, though in the same lane as the ego vehicle. Obstacle 10 is stationary and poses no immediate threat.
