To evaluate the risk for the ego vehicle and obstacles, we will focus on the last timestep at 5.1 seconds. Analyzing the data:

1. **Ego Vehicle: (ID: 16.0)**
   - Position: (-33.3011, -11.3396)
   - Velocity: 2.0202 m/s
   - Orientation angle is changing, indicating possible lateral movement.

2. **Obstacle 10.0**
   - Position: (-10.1676, -4.516)
   - Velocity: 0.0 m/s (stationary)
   - Despite sharing the same lanelet, distance and lack of velocity imply negligible risk. 
   - Relative distance suggests it's far laterally, therefore, risk = 5.

3. **Obstacle 12.0**
   - Position: (-17.5952, -6.6751)
   - Velocity: 0.2536 m/s
   - Moving very slowly and in the same lanelet. Despite being ahead, its speed is low and decelerating.
   - The separation remains significant, meaning this is not an urgent threat. Thus, risk = 4.

4. **Obstacle 21.0**
   - Position: (-38.1452, -12.6487)
   - Velocity: 3.624 m/s (approaching)
   - The obstacle is behind the ego vehicle and approaching at a decreasing speed. However, the lateral distance seems sufficient, with no immediate concern of side collision.
   - Given the position and relative speed differences, this does not constitute high risk. Risk = 3.

**Conclusion**: There are no obstacles with extreme or impending collision risk at this timestep. This detailed evaluation reveals all obstacles are at low or negligible risk levels due to their spatial positioning and speeds relative to the ego vehicle. Therefore, no immediate actions need to be taken by the ego's autonomous driving system.
