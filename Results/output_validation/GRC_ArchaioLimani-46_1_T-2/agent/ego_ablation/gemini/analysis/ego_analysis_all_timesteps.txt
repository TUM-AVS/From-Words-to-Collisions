At t=5.1s, Obstacle 21 is extremely close to the ego vehicle, with a longitudinal distance of -0.25m. This negative value indicates that Obstacle 21 is partially behind the ego vehicle, suggesting a potential rear-end collision or very near collision. The lateral distance is 0.00m.

Obstacle 10 and Obstacle 12 are further away longitudinally (18.18m and 10.90m respectively).  While they are moving towards the ego vehicle, their distances and relative velocities suggest they are not immediate collision risks.

**Analysis of Obstacles at t=5.1s**

* **Obstacle 10:**  Proximity (4), MDC (5), TTC (5). Overall risk is low.
* **Obstacle 12:** Proximity (4), MDC (4), TTC (4). Overall risk is low.
* **Obstacle 21:** Proximity (0), MDC (1), TTC (1). Overall risk is extremely high, bordering on collision.  The negative longitudinal distance suggests a likely collision.
