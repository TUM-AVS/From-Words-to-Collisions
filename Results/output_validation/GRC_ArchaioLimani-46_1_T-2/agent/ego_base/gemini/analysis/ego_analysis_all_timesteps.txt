At t=5.1s:
- **Obstacle 10:** Located front-left, 18.18m longitudinal and 6.56m lateral distance.  Moving towards the ego vehicle longitudinally at -2.02 m/s. No lateral relative motion. Given the distances, this obstacle is not an immediate threat and is categorized as a Low Risk (4).

- **Obstacle 12:** Located front-left, 10.90m longitudinal and 3.97m lateral distance. Moving towards the ego vehicle longitudinally at -1.78 m/s and laterally to the left at 0.08 m/s.  While the longitudinal distance is decreasing, it doesn't pose an immediate collision risk in this timestep, thus categorized as a Medium Risk (3).

- **Obstacle 21:** Located behind, -0.25m longitudinal distance. Moving towards the ego vehicle from behind at 1.39 m/s longitudinally and 1.21 m/s laterally. The very small longitudinal distance suggests an *extremely high risk of collision* even though the relative longitudinal velocity is low. The lateral movement further adds complexity and increases the risk. This is classified as an Extreme Risk (1).

Risk Levels:
0: Collision - Physical contact occurred or unavoidable
1: Extreme Risk - Immediate collision likely
2: High Risk - Close to collision, needs quick action
3: Medium Risk - Manageable with proper reaction
4: Low Risk - Minimal risk, sufficient time to react
5: Negligible Risk - No significant risk
