### Safety analysis for timestep 5.1s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

It's crucial to note that the provided scenario lacks crucial information for accurate TTC and MDC calculation.  Specifically, we need the ego vehicle's dimensions and those of the obstacles to compute adjusted longitudinal and lateral distances. The "Exact lateral alignment or unknown case" statements also introduce ambiguity.  Therefore, the following analysis relies on assumptions and approximations and should be treated with caution.

**Assumptions:**

* **Ego Vehicle and Obstacle Dimensions:**  Assuming both ego and obstacles have a length and width of approximately 4 meters.  This will be used to estimate safe margins.
* **"Exact lateral alignment"**:  This will be interpreted as potentially leading to a collision if longitudinal distances are also small, despite not having precise lateral offset information.


### Obstacle Analysis:

**- Obstacle ID: 10**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 10 is at 18.18m longitudinally and laterally.  With the assumed vehicle dimensions, this distance represents a low risk.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason:  Without accurate velocity information relative to the ego vehicle's trajectory, a precise TTC is impossible to determine.  However, the negative longitudinal velocity suggests the obstacle is moving towards the ego vehicle. Assuming constant velocity, a rough estimate of TTC is around 9 seconds.  
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 4

**- Obstacle ID: 12**
- Distance Risk reason: At 10.90m longitudinally and laterally from the ego vehicle, Obstacle 12 poses a medium risk. The closing velocity indicates an increasing risk in the immediate future.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: Similar to Obstacle 10, an exact TTC calculation is challenging. Assuming constant velocity, the estimated TTC is around 6 seconds.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 3

**- Obstacle ID: 21**
- Distance Risk reason:  Obstacle 21 is extremely close to the ego vehicle, both longitudinally (-0.25m) and laterally (-0.25m).  Given the assumed vehicle dimensions, a collision is imminent.
- Distance safety score: 0
- Time Risk reason:  The small distances combined with the provided closing velocities translate to a very short TTC, nearly zero. A collision is unavoidable with the current trajectories.
- Time safety score: 0
- Overall Risk score: 0
