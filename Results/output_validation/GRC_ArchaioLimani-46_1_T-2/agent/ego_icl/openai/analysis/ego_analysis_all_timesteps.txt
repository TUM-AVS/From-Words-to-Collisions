### Analysis of Most Recent Timestep (5.1 seconds)

#### Obstacle 10: Front-left
- **Position and Motion**: 
  - Adjusted Longitudinal Distance: 18.18 m
  - Adjusted Lateral Distance: 6.56 m
  - Relative velocity: Longitudinal -2.02 m/s, Lateral 0.00 m/s
  - Motion: Driving toward the ego vehicle longitudinally, no significant lateral motion.

**Trajectory Analysis**:
- The adjusted longitudinal distance has been decreasing steadily across the observed timesteps. 
- The lateral distance is increasing since the obstacle is moving from directly in front to right front-left diagonally.

**TTC and MDC Calculation**:
- **TTC Longitudinal**: 18.18 m / 2.02 m/s = ~9.00 seconds
- **TTC Lateral**: Not applicable due to no relative lateral velocity
- **MDC**: Primarily longitudinal because motion is longitudinally directed; lateral distance is significant and increasing, indicating no collision risk soon.

**Risk Assessment**:
- With a TTC > 5 seconds and a MDC significantly greater than 5 meters, this obstacle presents Negligible Risk.

#### Obstacle 12: Front-left
- **Position and Motion**: 
  - Adjusted Longitudinal Distance: 10.90 m
  - Adjusted Lateral Distance: 3.97 m
  - Relative velocity: Longitudinal -1.78 m/s, Lateral 0.08 m/s
  - Motion: Driving toward the ego vehicle, moving away laterally (left).

**Trajectory Analysis**:
- The longitudinal distance is consistently decreasing. However, lateral movement away decreases risk significantly.

**TTC and MDC Calculation**:
- **TTC Longitudinal**: 10.90 m / 1.78 m/s = ~6.12 seconds
- **TTC Lateral**: Not critical as lateral distance is increasing.
- **MDC**: Mainly determined by longitudinal approach; no risk identified since lateral separation increases.

**Risk Assessment**:
- With a TTC for longitudinal and lateral both indicating a risk-free situation soon, this obstacle is Low Risk.

#### Obstacle 21: Behind
- **Position and Motion**: 
  - Adjusted Longitudinal Distance: -0.25 m
  - Adjusted Lateral Distance: 0.00 m
  - Relative velocity: Longitudinal 1.39 m/s, Lateral 1.21 m/s
  - Motion: Driving toward ego from behind with significant acceleration components.

**Trajectory Analysis**:
- The obstacle is very close, with relative motion indicating potential future collision.

**TTC and MDC Calculation**:
- **TTC Longitudinal**: Not directly applicable due to existing negative and close distance, indicating possible imminent or recent collision history.
- **MDC**: Given that the obstacle was catching up with decreasing negative longitudinal values, it poses an immediate risk.

**Risk Assessment**:
- Given the very close distances (almost overlap negative), this obstacle represents a Collision situation requiring immediate intervention.
