At t=5.3s, Ego is at (-32.89, -11.34) with a velocity of 2.11 m/s.

Obstacle 10 is stationary at (-10.17, -4.52) and poses no immediate risk.

Obstacle 12 is at (-17.55, -6.66) with a velocity of 0.20 m/s and decelerating.  Given the distances and relative velocities, there is no immediate risk.

Obstacle 21 is at (-37.49, -12.46) with velocity 3.38 m/s and decelerating.  The y-coordinates are very close (-11.34 vs. -12.46), and while the x-coordinates appear separated by ~4.6 meters, the closing velocity is notable. While not an immediate collision at 5.3s, the trajectories suggest a rapidly increasing risk in the next few timesteps. This warrants a "High Risk" assessment.
