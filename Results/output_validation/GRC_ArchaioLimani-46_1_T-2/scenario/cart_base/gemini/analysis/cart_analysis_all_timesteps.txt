At t=5.3s, Ego is at (-32.89, -11.34) with a velocity of 2.11 m/s and decelerating at 0.31 m/s².

Obstacle 10 is stationary at (-10.17, -4.52) and poses no immediate risk.

Obstacle 12 is at (-17.55, -6.66) with a velocity of 0.20 m/s and decelerating at 0.26 m/s².  While it's in the same lanelet and moving slowly, it's a significant distance from Ego and not an immediate threat.

Obstacle 21 is at (-37.49, -12.46) with a velocity of 3.38 m/s and decelerating at 1.03 m/s². It's in the same lanelet as Ego and closer than the other obstacles. Analyzing the trajectories from previous timesteps shows both Ego and Obstacle 21 are moving in roughly the same direction and decelerating. While Obstacle 21 is behind Ego, its velocity is higher than Ego's, increasing the risk of a collision in the near future if this trend continues.  This represents a high risk (2), but not an extreme risk (1) at this precise moment.
