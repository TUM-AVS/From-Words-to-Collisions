### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 10.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 10.0 is far from the ego vehicle and remains stationary throughout the scenario.  Its position is significantly different in the Y-axis, suggesting it's in a different part of the road.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: The obstacle is stationary, posing no immediate time-related risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 12.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 12.0 is a moderate distance from the ego vehicle. While it is in the same lanelet and its X-coordinate suggests it's ahead of the ego vehicle, the historical data shows it is moving slowly and decelerating. The difference in Y-coordinate also reduces the direct collision risk.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: Obstacle 12.0 is moving slowly and decelerating, reducing the risk of collision over time.  
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- Obstacle ID: 21.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 21.0 is behind the ego vehicle but in the same lanelet. It is relatively close and approaching the ego vehicle, but the Y-coordinate difference indicates some lateral separation within the lanelet.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: While obstacle 21.0 is approaching the ego vehicle, both vehicles are moving in the same direction, and obstacle 21.0 is also decelerating. This reduces the likelihood of a collision in the short term.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3


### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. **Most critical obstacles:** Obstacles 12.0 and 21.0 are the most critical because they are in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle. Obstacle 10.0 is stationary and poses no risk.

2. **Trajectory analysis:** Over the 10 timesteps, obstacle 12.0 remains ahead of the ego vehicle and decelerates. Obstacle 21.0 remains behind the ego vehicle and decelerates slightly as well.  Although behind, Obstacle 21.0 exhibits some fluctuating deceleration rates.

3. **Relative positions, velocities, and accelerations:** Obstacle 12.0 is ahead and moving slower than the ego vehicle, decreasing the risk. Obstacle 21.0 is behind and also decelerating reducing the rate of closure to the ego vehicle. The consistent deceleration also suggests a controlled rather than erratic behavior.

4. **Collision determination:** Based on the provided data, no collision has occurred or is immediately imminent.

5. **Reasoning:** The combination of relative positions, velocities, and accelerations suggests that the scenario is not a collision scenario. Although obstacles 21.0 is relatively close and approaching, the ego vehicle is also decelerating and their trajectories do not intersect within the observed time frame, along with a slight lateral separation within the lanelet.

    "IsCollisionScenario": false,
    "Reasoning": "No collisions are detected. Although obstacle 21.0 is approaching from behind in the same lane, both are decelerating and their separation is not decreasing at a high rate indicating risk and there's lateral separation within the lanelet.  Obstacle 12.0 is ahead and slowing down. Obstacle 10.0 is stationary and far from the ego vehicle."
