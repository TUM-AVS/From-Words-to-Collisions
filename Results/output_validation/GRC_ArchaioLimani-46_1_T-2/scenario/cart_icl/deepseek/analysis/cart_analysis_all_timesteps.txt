### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. **Ego Vehicle**: Moving at 2.1123 m/s with slight acceleration (0.3055 m/sÂ²).
2. **Obstacles**: Most are either stationary or moving away. No obstacles are on a direct collision path.
3. **Closest Obstacles**: 9.0, 11.0, 17.0, and 18.0 are relatively close but not in immediate danger.
4. **Conclusion**: No collision risk detected. All obstacles are either stationary, moving away, or at a safe distance.
