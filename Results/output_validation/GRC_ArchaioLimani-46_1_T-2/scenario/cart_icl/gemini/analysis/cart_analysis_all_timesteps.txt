### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 10.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is far from the ego vehicle and poses no immediate threat.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Obstacle is stationary.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 12.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is moderately far from the ego vehicle.  While in the same lane, the distance suggests no immediate collision risk.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Obstacle is moving slowly and decelerating. The ego vehicle is also decelerating, reducing the risk over time.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- Obstacle ID: 21.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is relatively close to the ego vehicle and in the same lane, posing a potential risk.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: Obstacle and ego vehicle are both moving in the same direction, but the obstacle is moving faster and decelerating less aggressively. This suggests a decreasing distance between them.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3


### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
No obstacles have a risk score of 0, indicating no immediate collisions. Obstacle 21.0 has the highest risk with a score of 3, suggesting a medium risk due to proximity and relative velocity but no immediate danger. The ego vehicle's deceleration and the obstacle's position and similar orientation implies the risk is likely manageable with appropriate actions.  Therefore, this is not a collision scenario.
