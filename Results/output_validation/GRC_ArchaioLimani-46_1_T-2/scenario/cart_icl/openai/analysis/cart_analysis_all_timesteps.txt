### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep:

### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 10.0**
  - **Distance Risk Reason**: This obstacle has remained stationary at the same position across all timesteps. The ego vehicle has been moving away from this obstacle.
  - **Distance Safety Score**: 5
  - **Time Risk Reason**: With a velocity and acceleration of zero, obstacle 10.0 poses no imminent threat regardless of egoâ€™s movements.
  - **Time Safety Score**: 5
  - **Overall Risk Score**: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 12.0**
  - **Distance Risk Reason**: Over the course of the timesteps, it has shown a slow decrease in speed and consistent positioning ahead of the ego vehicle.
  - **Distance Safety Score**: 4
  - **Time Risk Reason**: Obstacle 12.0 shows a decrease in velocity, indicating reduced risk as time progresses.
  - **Time Safety Score**: 4
  - **Overall Risk Score**: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 21.0**
  - **Distance Risk Reason**: Consistently moving away from the ego vehicle with relatively rapid progress down the lanelet. There is additional lateral clearance as per their relative trajectories.
  - **Distance Safety Score**: 4
  - **Time Risk Reason**: Despite higher velocity compared to ego vehicle, it decelerates significantly over time suggesting lesser risk.
  - **Time Safety Score**: 4
  - **Overall Risk Score**: 4

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. **Obstacle 10.0** remains stationary; its potential collision scenario is negligible.
2. **Obstacle 12.0** has a small relative lateral and longitudinal distance risk due to slow speeds and consistent deceleration.
3. **Obstacle 21.0** moves quickly but is decelerating and increasing its distance over time.

This scenario does not constitute a collision scenario as no obstacles are on an immediate or near-immediate crash course with the ego vehicle.

        "IsCollisionScenario": false,
        "Reasoning": "All obstacles are at a low risk of collision due to their trajectories and speed relative to the ego vehicle. Ego vehicle is diverging from stationary obstacle while mobile obstacles decelerate and distance increases over time."
