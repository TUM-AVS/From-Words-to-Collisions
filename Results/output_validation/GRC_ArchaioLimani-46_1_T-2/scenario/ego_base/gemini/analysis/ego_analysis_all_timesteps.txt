Obstacle 21 is behind the ego vehicle and is very close (-0.09m) longitudinally.  The relative longitudinal velocity suggests it is still approaching the ego vehicle (1.13 m/s). Although the relative acceleration indicates some deceleration (-1.29 m/sÂ²), the proximity and ongoing approach represent a high risk of collision.

Obstacle 12 is in front-left of the ego vehicle (10.81m longitudinal, 3.12m lateral) and moving towards the ego vehicle longitudinally (-1.92 m/s) and slightly laterally (0.06 m/s).  The relative distance and velocity indicate a medium risk, but the situation warrants attention as the lateral movement could lead to increased risk in subsequent timesteps.

Obstacle 10 is in front-left of the ego vehicle (18.19m longitudinal, 5.30m lateral) and moving towards the ego vehicle longitudinally (-2.11 m/s). The relative distance and velocity indicate a medium to low risk.
