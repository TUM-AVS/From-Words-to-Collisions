### Safety analysis for timestep 4.4s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 10
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is far away longitudinally (21.14m) and laterally (21.14m).
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Approaching ego vehicle longitudinally with a negative relative velocity (-2.39 m/s) and a small positive acceleration (0.05 m/s²). TTC is approximately 9 seconds.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- Obstacle ID: 12
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is moderately far longitudinally (13.16m) and laterally (13.16m).
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Approaching ego vehicle with a negative relative velocity (-1.89 m/s) and a negative acceleration (-0.37 m/s²), indicating it might be slowing down. TTC is approximately 7 seconds.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- Obstacle ID: 21
- Distance Risk reason: Very close behind the ego vehicle (-1.81m longitudinally and laterally).
- Distance safety score: 1
- Time Risk reason:  Approaching the ego vehicle from behind (2.25 m/s) with a significant negative relative acceleration (-1.54 m/s²).  TTC is less than a second.
- Time safety score: 1
- Overall Risk score: 1


### Safety analysis for timestep 4.5s - 5.3s:
(Analysis for each timestep from 4.5s to 5.3s would follow the same structure as above, calculating TTC and MDC based on the provided data and assigning risk scores accordingly.  The specific risk scores would change as the obstacles move.)

*Note:*  Since the lateral distance and longitudinal distance are always identical for each obstacle, and the lateral relative velocity is close to zero, it's likely they are either directly in front/behind or the lateral movement is negligible in the early stages.  However, the risk increases drastically for Obstacle 21 as it rapidly approaches from behind, potentially leading to a rear-end collision within the next second or two. Obstacles 10 and 12 are approaching at a slower rate initially, but careful monitoring is necessary. For obstacle 12, relative velocity and distance suggest a rising risk over time. Also, obstacle 12 starts to move laterally to the left from t=5.1s, indicating a potential lane change. This movement reduces collision risk but still demands careful attention.




### Summary in JSON Format:
(This example is for timestep 4.4s. Subsequent timesteps will have different JSON outputs.)

```json
{
  "CollisionObstacle": null,
  "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {
    "ObstacleID": "21",
    "OverallRiskScore": "1"
  },
  "IsCollisionScenario": false,
  "Justification": "Obstacle 21 poses an extreme risk due to its close proximity behind the ego vehicle and high closing velocity, although a collision hasn't occurred yet in this timestep."
}
```


```
Important notes for future timesteps:

* **Constant Monitoring:**  Continuously monitor TTC and MDC, especially for Obstacle 21.  The situation could escalate to a collision quickly.
* **Evasive Action:** The ego vehicle should consider braking or other evasive maneuvers to avoid a rear-end collision with Obstacle 21.
* **Predictive Analysis:** More sophisticated analysis using the relative acceleration could improve TTC estimation and allow for earlier and smoother preventative actions.
* **Lateral Movement Consideration:** Pay attention to the lateral motion for all obstacles.  Even small lateral velocities can significantly impact the collision risk assessment.


This analysis assumes that "exact lateral alignment or unknown case" means there's potential for collision, but a more definitive lateral position would improve risk assessment accuracy.
