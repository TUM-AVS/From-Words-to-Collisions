* **Obstacle 10 Analysis:**

Obstacle 10 is consistently in front-left of the ego vehicle and maintains a safe lateral distance (increasing from 0.45m to 5.30m in the last few timesteps).  Longitudinally, it is moving towards the ego vehicle, but at a relatively slow speed and large distance (18.19m).

* Longitudinal TTC: 18.19m / 2.11m/s ≈ 8.62s
* Lateral TTC: Not applicable since lateral velocity is near zero and distance increasing
* MDC:  The minimum distance to collision is primarily determined by the lateral distance in this case, since the lateral velocity is near zero and distance increasing.  MDC ≈ 5.30m.

Risk Assessment for Obstacle 10: No Risk (5)


* **Obstacle 12 Analysis:**

Obstacle 12 is in front-left and is moving towards the ego vehicle both longitudinally and laterally (though the lateral velocity is low). The lateral distance decrease from 3.97m to 3.12m in the last few timesteps while the longitudinal distance decreases from 10.90m to 10.81m.

* Longitudinal TTC: 10.81m / 1.92m/s ≈ 5.63s
* Lateral TTC: 3.12m / 0.06m/s ≈ 52s.
* MDC: The MDC is primarily determined by the lateral distance and velocity.  MDC ≈ 3.12m.

Risk Assessment for Obstacle 12: Low Risk (4)

* **Obstacle 21 Analysis:**

Obstacle 21 is behind the ego vehicle and rapidly approaching.  It is also moving laterally, but its longitudinal motion is the primary concern due to a very small longitudinal distance (-0.09m, meaning it's very close behind). The consistent decrease in longitudinal distance and positive relative velocity despite negative relative acceleration indicates high risk. It is likely on a collision path, and MDC can be approximated as 0 since the lateral distance is also 0 and relative velocity is high.

* Longitudinal TTC: 0.09m / 1.13m/s ≈ 0.08s 
* Lateral TTC: 0.00m / 0.95m/s ≈ 0.00s
* MDC ≈ 0.00m

Risk Assessment for Obstacle 21: Extreme Risk (1)


**Overall Collision Scenario Assessment:**

Yes, this is a collision scenario. Obstacle 21 poses an Extreme Risk (1) with a very low TTC (0.08s) and nearly zero distance, indicating an imminent rear-end collision.
