To evaluate the provided autonomous driving scenario and determine the collision risk, let's analyze the most recent timestep (5.3 seconds) using adjusted distances and additional trajectory information.

**Obstacle 10 Analysis:**

- **Position:** Front-left
- **Adjusted distances:** Longitudinal = 18.19 m, Lateral = 5.30 m
- **Relative velocity:** Longitudinal = -2.11 m/s, Lateral = 0.00 m/s
- **Trajectory:** Obstacle is maintaining its path towards the ego car longitudinally with no lateral motion.

**Risk Calculation for Obstacle 10:**

- **MDC (based on adjusted distances):** Consider the smaller adjusted dimension, longitudinal in this case. MDC is 18.19 m.
- **TTC:** 
  - Longitudinal: \( \text{TTC} = \frac{18.19\, \text{m}}{2.11\, \text{m/s}} \approx 8.62 \, \text{seconds} \)
- **Risk Assessment:**
  - Both the longitudinal MDC > 5.0m and TTC > 5.0 seconds suggest a **No Risk** (5).

**Obstacle 12 Analysis:**

- **Position:** Front-left
- **Adjusted distances:** Longitudinal = 10.81 m, Lateral = 3.12 m
- **Relative velocity:** Longitudinal = -1.92 m/s, Lateral = 0.06 m/s
- **Trajectory:** Moving leftward, away laterally.

**Risk Calculation for Obstacle 12:**

- **MDC:**
  - Calculate longitudinal first as it is smaller: \( \text{MDC} = 10.81 \, \text{m} \)
- **TTC:**
  - Longitudinal: \( \text{TTC} = \frac{10.81\, \text{m}}{1.92\, \text{m/s}} \approx 5.63 \, \text{seconds} \)
- **Risk Assessment:**
  - Both the longitudinal MDC > 5.0m and TTC > 5.0 seconds suggest a **No Risk** (5).

**Obstacle 21 Analysis:**

- **Position:** Behind
- **Adjusted distances:** Longitudinal = -0.09 m (indicating it's very close), Lateral = 0.00 m
- **Relative velocity:** Longitudinal = 1.13 m/s, Lateral = 0.95 m/s
- **Trajectory:** Fast approaching from behind with exact alignment.

**Risk Calculation for Obstacle 21:**

- **MDC:**
  - With very close proximity in longitudinal, pace it particularly critical.
  - MDC (Longitudinal) is effectively 0.09 m as it is closest.
- **TTC:**
  - Longitudinal: \( \text{TTC} = \frac{0.09\, \text{m}}{1.13\, \text{m/s}} \approx 0.08 \, \text{seconds} \)
  - Since lateral velocity indicates a fast convergence, this supports a critical risk condition.
- **Risk Assessment:**
  - Both very small MDC (= 0.09m) and very low TTC (â‰ˆ 0.08s) strongly indicate an **Extreme Risk** (1).

### Conclusion:

This scenario identifies Obstacle 21 as having an extreme risk of collision due to its minimal separation distance and rapid relative velocity, creating a critical situation.
