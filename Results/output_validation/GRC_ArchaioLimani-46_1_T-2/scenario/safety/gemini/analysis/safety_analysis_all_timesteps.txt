### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
    - Obstacle ID: 10
    - Relative Direction: Front-left
    - Distance Risk Reason: DTClong is 18.19m and DTClat is 5.30m, suggesting a low longitudinal risk and a negligible lateral risk. The trend over time shows obstacle 10 generally maintaining a safe longitudinal distance while initially moving slightly closer laterally before stabilizing.
    - Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 5
    - Lateral Distance Safety Score: 5
    - Overall Distance Safety Score: 5.0
    - Time Risk Reason: TTClong is 8.61s indicating negligible risk, and TTClat is inf, confirming no lateral collision risk.  Past timesteps show consistently safe TTC values for obstacle 10.
    - Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 5
    - Lateral Time Safety Score: 5
    - Overall Time Safety Score: 5.0
    - Overall Risk Score: 5

    - Obstacle ID: 12
    - Relative Direction: Front-left
    - Distance Risk Reason: DTClong is 10.81m and DTClat is 3.12m, indicating a low longitudinal risk and a low lateral risk.  The obstacle has been approaching longitudinally but moving away laterally over the past few timesteps.
    - Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 4
    - Lateral Distance Safety Score: 4
    - Overall Distance Safety Score: 4.0
    - Time Risk Reason: TTClong is 5.63s indicating a low risk, and TTClat is inf, signifying no lateral collision risk. Prior timesteps also indicate a generally safe TTClong, trending slightly downward.
    - Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 4
    - Lateral Time Safety Score: 5
    - Overall Time Safety Score: 4.5
    - Overall Risk Score: 4

    - Obstacle ID: 21
    - Relative Direction: Behind
    - Distance Risk Reason: DTClong is -0.09m which indicates an EXTREMELY HIGH risk as it is almost touching the ego vehicle. DTClat is 0.00m signifying no lateral risk.  The negative DTClong and decreasing trend across timesteps show this obstacle is rapidly approaching from behind.
    - Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 1
    - Lateral Distance Safety Score: 5
    - Overall Distance Safety Score: 1.0
    - Time Risk Reason: TTClong is 0.08s signifying an EXTREME risk of imminent collision. TTClat is 0.00 signifying no lateral risk. The extremely low and decreasing TTClong throughout the timesteps further emphasizes the imminent rear-end collision risk.
    - Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 1
    - Lateral Time Safety Score: 5
    - Overall Time Safety Score: 1.0
    - Overall Risk Score: 1
