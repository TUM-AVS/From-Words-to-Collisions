Here's the collision risk analysis:

**Obstacle 20036:** This obstacle is far from the ego vehicle and poses no immediate threat.  Its velocity is decreasing, further reducing risk. Risk score: 5 (Negligible Risk)

**Obstacle 20037:** This obstacle is moderately far from the ego vehicle.  It is also decelerating, lessening the risk of collision. Risk score: 4 (Low Risk)

**Obstacle 20039:** This obstacle is the closest to the ego vehicle and is moving at a considerably higher speed. However, it *is* decelerating, and based on the provided trajectory information, a collision does not appear imminent in the very near future. It requires monitoring and potentially a moderate reaction from the ego vehicle. Risk score: 3 (Medium Risk - due to proximity and speed differential even though decelerating).

Based on the provided data, the ego vehicle and obstacle 20039 have a decreasing speed differential which, when considered with the current trajectories, further reduces the likelihood of an immediate collision. Hence there are no Extreme Risk Obstacles.  Further data points would improve prediction accuracy for longer-term collision assessment.
