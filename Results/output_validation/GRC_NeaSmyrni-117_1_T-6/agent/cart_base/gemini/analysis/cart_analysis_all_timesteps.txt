Obstacle 20036: This obstacle is far from the ego vehicle and its velocity is decreasing to near zero.  It poses a negligible risk.

Obstacle 20037: This obstacle is also far from the ego vehicle and while closer than 20036, its decelerating and the distance between the vehicles is increasing. It poses a low to medium risk.

Obstacle 20039: This obstacle is behind the ego vehicle and is moving faster but decelerating.  The closing rate initially seemed high and concerning, but the deceleration and continued trend suggest a high probability of the obstacle slowing sufficiently before a collision.  It represents a medium to high risk requiring monitoring but not immediate drastic action.
