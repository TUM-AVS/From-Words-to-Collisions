In evaluating the most recent timestep (3.4 seconds) of the provided scenario, hereâ€™s the analysis of each obstacle:

1. **Obstacle 20036.0**:  
   - **Position**: (-18.3043, -18.0321), **Velocity**: 0.0  
   - This obstacle is stationary and located far from the Ego. Since it is not moving, the relative velocity to the Ego is almost null, and the distance is wide enough to suggest a negligible risk.   

2. **Obstacle 20037.0**:  
   - **Position**: (-23.5152, -23.1681), **Velocity**: 0.6663  
   - The low speed of this obstacle suggests a low relative velocity, but the proximity and matching lanelet with the Ego could pose a slight risk. There is still a significant distance to the Ego vehicle, allowing the risk to remain low.  

3. **Obstacle 20039.0**:  
   - **Position**: (-40.5073, -39.9164), **Velocity**: 5.9359  
   - This obstacle has a higher speed compared to others and shares the same lanelet as the Ego. While it is behind the Ego, its higher speed and direction of travel mean it could catch up. This leads to a manageable risk but requires ongoing attention.   

### Summary of Observations:

- **Risk Levels**:  
  - **Obstacle 20036.0**: Risk Level 5 (Negligible Risk)  
  - **Obstacle 20037.0**: Risk Level 4 (Low Risk)  
  - **Obstacle 20039.0**: Risk Level 3 (Medium Risk)  

None of the obstacles represent an immediate high risk or collision scenario given the sufficient relative distances and velocities.
