At timestep 3.4s, obstacle 20039 is approaching ego from behind at high speed.  All other obstacles are not a high risk.

Obstacle 20036 is stationary and poses no risk. Obstacle 20037 is moving slower than ego and is increasing in distance from ego. Obstacle 20039, however, is rapidly approaching ego, and although it is still some distance away, its high closing speed warrants attention. A simple TTC calculation between ego and obstacle 20039:

Ego Position: (-37.0545, -36.513)
Obstacle 20039 Position: (-40.5073, -39.9164)

Approximate longitudinal distance: -3.45m (obstacle is behind ego)
Ego Velocity: 1.6358 m/s
Obstacle 20039 Velocity: 5.9359 m/s
Relative Longitudinal Velocity: 4.3001 m/s (obstacle approaching ego)
Approximate TTC: -3.45 / 4.3001 = -0.8 seconds. This suggests the obstacle might overtake ego within the next second.

Since the data provided lacks lateral positional information for comprehensive MDC calculation and the precise time of overtaking is uncertain, I assign a "High Risk (2)" to obstacle 20039 to highlight the need for careful monitoring and potential evasive maneuvers. The lateral distance between the vehicles might be small increasing risk.
