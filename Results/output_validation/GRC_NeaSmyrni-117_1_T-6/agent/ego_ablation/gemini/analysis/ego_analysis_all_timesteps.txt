At timestamp 3.4 seconds, Obstacle 20039 poses an extreme risk of collision with the ego vehicle. Obstacles 20036 and 20037 are not a collision risk.

Obstacle 20036: This obstacle is in front of the ego vehicle at a longitudinal distance of 21.82 meters.  With a relative longitudinal velocity of -1.64 m/s, it is approaching the ego vehicle, but the distance is substantial, giving ample time to react. This obstacle poses a negligible risk (5).

Obstacle 20037: This obstacle is also in front of the ego vehicle, at a longitudinal distance of 14.50 meters and closing at -0.97 m/s. Although closer than Obstacle 20036, it still represents a negligible risk (5) due to the substantial distance.

Obstacle 20039: This obstacle is behind the ego vehicle at a longitudinal distance of -0.34 meters and closing at 4.30 m/s.  This extremely small distance combined with the approaching velocity represents an imminent collision risk.  The MDC is less than 0.5 meters, and the TTC is also extremely low (less than 0.5 seconds), making this an extreme risk (1).
