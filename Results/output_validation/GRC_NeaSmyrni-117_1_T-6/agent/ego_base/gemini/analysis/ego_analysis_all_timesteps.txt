At t=3.4s, Obstacle 20036 is in front of the ego vehicle at a longitudinal distance of 21.82m, moving towards the ego vehicle with a relative velocity of -1.64 m/s.  Given the distance and relative velocity, this obstacle poses a low risk.

At t=3.4s, Obstacle 20037 is in front of the ego vehicle at a longitudinal distance of 14.50m, moving towards the ego vehicle with a relative velocity of -0.97 m/s.  Given the distance and relative velocity, this obstacle poses a low risk.

At t=3.4s, Obstacle 20039 is behind the ego vehicle at a longitudinal distance of -0.34m, moving towards the ego vehicle (from behind) with a relative velocity of 4.30 m/s. This is extremely close, indicating a very high probability of collision in the next time step. This obstacle represents a collision risk.


Risk Levels:
0: Collision - Physical contact occurred or unavoidable
1: Extreme Risk - Immediate collision likely
2: High Risk - Close to collision, needs quick action
3: Medium Risk - Manageable with proper reaction
4: Low Risk - Minimal risk, sufficient time to react
5: Negligible Risk - No significant risk
