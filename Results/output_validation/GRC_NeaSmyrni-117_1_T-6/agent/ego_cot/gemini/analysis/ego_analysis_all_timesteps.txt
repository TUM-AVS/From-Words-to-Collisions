### Safety analysis for timestep 3.4s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

**Assumptions and Clarifications:**

* Since adjusted distances (adjusted_d_long, adjusted_d_lat) are not provided, raw DTClong and DTClat values are used.  This may lead to less precise risk assessments. It's HIGHLY recommended to include adjusted distances in future analyses.
* Lateral movement is negligible for all obstacles relative to the ego vehicle, so TTClat and MDClat are not explicitly calculated, and the focus is primarily on longitudinal movement (DTClong, Vrel_long, Arel_long).
* A simplified TTC calculation is used: `TTClong = DTClong / Vrel_long`  assuming constant velocity.  A more sophisticated approach would incorporate relative acceleration.
