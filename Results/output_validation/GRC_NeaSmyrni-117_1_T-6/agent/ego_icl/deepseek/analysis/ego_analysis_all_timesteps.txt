### Obstacle-by-Obstacle Analysis:

#### **Obstacle 20036 (Front)**
- **Position**: Front (longitudinal 21.82m, lateral 0.00m)
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal -1.64 m/s (approaching), Lateral 0.00 m/s (no lateral movement)
- **Trajectory Analysis**: 
  - Longitudinal distance is decreasing steadily (~1.65 m/s closing speed).
  - Lateral alignment is exact (0.00m), but no lateral movement.
- **Time-to-Collision (TTC)**:
  - Longitudinal TTC = 21.82 / 1.64 ≈ **13.30 seconds** (Negligible Risk, TTC > 5.0s)
- **Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC)**:
  - MDC is the current longitudinal distance (21.82m) since lateral distance is stable.
  - **MDC = 21.82m** (Negligible Risk, MDC > 5.0m)
- **Risk Assessment**: 
  - **Overall Risk Score: 5 (Negligible Risk)** – No immediate threat.

#### **Obstacle 20037 (Front)**
- **Position**: Front (longitudinal 14.50m, lateral 0.00m)
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal -0.97 m/s (approaching), Lateral 0.00 m/s (no lateral movement)
- **Trajectory Analysis**:
  - Longitudinal distance is decreasing (~0.97 m/s closing speed).
  - Lateral alignment is exact (0.00m), but no lateral movement.
- **Time-to-Collision (TTC)**:
  - Longitudinal TTC = 14.50 / 0.97 ≈ **14.95 seconds** (Negligible Risk, TTC > 5.0s)
- **Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC)**:
  - MDC is the current longitudinal distance (14.50m) since lateral distance is stable.
  - **MDC = 14.50m** (Negligible Risk, MDC > 5.0m)
- **Risk Assessment**:
  - **Overall Risk Score: 5 (Negligible Risk)** – No immediate threat.

#### **Obstacle 20039 (Behind)**
- **Position**: Behind (longitudinal -0.34m, lateral 0.00m)
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal 4.30 m/s (approaching rapidly), Lateral 0.00 m/s (no lateral movement)
- **Trajectory Analysis**:
  - Longitudinal distance is decreasing rapidly (~4.30 m/s closing speed).
  - Lateral alignment is exact (0.00m), but no lateral movement.
- **Time-to-Collision (TTC)**:
  - Longitudinal TTC = 0.34 / 4.30 ≈ **0.079 seconds** (Extreme Risk, TTC < 0.5s)
- **Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC)**:
  - MDC is the current longitudinal distance (0.34m) since lateral distance is stable.
  - **MDC = 0.34m** (Extreme Risk, MDC < 0.5m)
- **Risk Assessment**:
  - **Overall Risk Score: 0 (Collision)** – Obstacle is already overlapping with the ego vehicle (negative distance) and closing rapidly. Collision is imminent or already occurring.

### Key Findings:
1. **Obstacle 20039** is at **Collision Risk (Score 0)**. It is already overlapping with the ego vehicle (longitudinal distance = -0.34m) and closing at 4.30 m/s, indicating an unavoidable collision.
2. Obstacles 20036 and 20037 pose **Negligible Risk (Score 5)** due to large distances and slow closing speeds.
3. No other obstacles are at Extreme Risk (Score 1) or High Risk (Score 2). 

### Immediate Action Required:
- **Emergency braking or evasive maneuver** is needed to mitigate the collision with Obstacle 20039. The collision is unavoidable based on current trajectories.
