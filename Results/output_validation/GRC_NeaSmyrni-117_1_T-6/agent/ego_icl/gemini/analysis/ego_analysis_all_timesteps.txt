Obstacle 20036:
- Trajectory: Consistently in front and longitudinally aligned with the ego vehicle, maintaining a safe distance over the observed time steps. The longitudinal distance is decreasing slowly.
- TTC:  21.82m / 1.64 m/s ≈ 13.3s (Longitudinal). Lateral TTC is not applicable due to 0 lateral velocity.
- MDC: Approximately 21.82m (Longitudinal). Lateral MDC is effectively zero due to consistent alignment.
- Risk: 5 (Negligible Risk)

Obstacle 20037:
- Trajectory: Consistently in front and longitudinally aligned with the ego vehicle, maintaining a safe distance over the observed time steps. The longitudinal distance is decreasing slowly.
- TTC: 14.50m / 0.97m/s ≈ 14.9s (Longitudinal). Lateral TTC is not applicable due to 0 lateral velocity.
- MDC: Approximately 14.50m (Longitudinal). Lateral MDC is effectively zero due to consistent alignment.
- Risk: 5 (Negligible Risk)


Obstacle 20039:
- Trajectory: Consistently behind and longitudinally aligned with the ego vehicle. The longitudinal distance is rapidly decreasing, indicating a potential collision.
- TTC: 0.34m / 4.30m/s ≈ 0.08s (Longitudinal). Lateral TTC is not applicable.
- MDC: Approximately 0.34m. Lateral MDC is effectively zero due to consistent alignment.
- Risk: 1 (Extreme Risk - Imminent rear-end collision)
