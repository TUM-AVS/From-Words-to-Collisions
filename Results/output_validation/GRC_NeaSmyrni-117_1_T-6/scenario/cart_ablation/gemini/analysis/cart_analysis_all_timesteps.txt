At t=3.6s, Ego's position is (-36.8215, -36.2834) and its velocity is 1.6008. Let's analyze the risk posed by each obstacle at this timestep:

- **Obstacle 20036:** Position (-18.3043, -18.0321), velocity 0. This obstacle poses no immediate risk as it is stationary and far from the ego vehicle. Risk score: 5.

- **Obstacle 20037:** Position (-23.4324, -23.0865), velocity 0.5091.  This obstacle is also relatively far and its low velocity suggests a low risk of collision in the immediate future. Risk score: 4.

- **Obstacle 20039:** Position (-39.692, -39.1128), velocity 5.5166. This obstacle is behind the ego vehicle but its high velocity and proximity warrant attention.  The closing velocity is high, making a future collision possible if the ego vehicle were to slow down significantly or the obstacle continues to accelerate. It represents a medium risk at this timestep. Risk score: 3.


Since no obstacle poses an extreme or collision risk, the following JSON output reflects this:

```json
{
  "CollisionObstacles": [],
  "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null,
  "ScenarioAnalysis": {
    "IsCollisionScenario": false,
    "Reasoning": "No obstacle is on a collision course with the ego vehicle at the most recent timestep (t=3.6s). Though obstacle 20039 is approaching from behind at high speed and warrants monitoring in subsequent timesteps, it currently poses only a medium risk."
  }
}
```
