At t=3.6s, Ego is at (-36.8215, -36.2834) and moving with a velocity of 1.6008.

Obstacle 20036 is stationary at (-18.3043, -18.0321), posing no immediate risk.

Obstacle 20037 is at (-23.4324, -23.0865) with a velocity of 0.5091.  While in the same lanelet, the distance and differing velocities suggest low risk.

Obstacle 20039 is at (-39.692, -39.1128) with a velocity of 5.5166. This obstacle is behind the ego vehicle, but its significantly higher velocity and closing distance suggest a potential for collision in the near future if these trajectories continue. This is categorized as a high risk (2) due to the short timeframe for a safe maneuver.  However, it doesn't yet reach Extreme Risk (1).

Since there are no obstacles with a risk score of 0 or 1, `CollisionObstacles` and `ExtremeRiskObstacle` are set to null.  The scenario is not a collision scenario.

    "Reasoning": "No collisions or imminent collisions detected in the most recent timestep (t=3.6s). Obstacle 20039 presents a high risk due to its closing velocity from behind, but it is not an immediate collision risk."
