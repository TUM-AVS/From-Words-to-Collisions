### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 20036.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 20036.0 is far behind the ego vehicle and stationary.  The historical data confirms it has been slowing down and has now stopped. Poses no immediate threat.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason:  The obstacle is stationary and far behind, posing no risk related to time.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 20037.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 20037.0 is a moderate distance behind the ego vehicle and decelerating. While closer than 20036.0, the historical data shows it's moving slower than the ego vehicle and the gap is widening.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Although decelerating, the relative velocity and distance suggest sufficient time for the ego vehicle to react if necessary.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- Obstacle ID: 20039.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 20039.0 is behind the ego vehicle but significantly closer than the other obstacles. The historical data shows it is closing the gap, though it is also decelerating.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: While the obstacle is decelerating, the closing distance and relatively higher speed warrant attention.  The continued proximity requires monitoring.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3


### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. **Most critical obstacle:** Obstacle 20039.0 poses the highest risk due to its proximity and closing speed relative to the ego vehicle.

2. **Trajectory analysis:** Over the 10 timesteps, obstacle 20039.0 has been consistently behind the ego vehicle but gradually decreasing the distance between them. Its velocity is higher than the ego vehicle's but it's decelerating.

3. **Relative positions, velocities, and accelerations:** At the last timestep, obstacle 20039.0 is approximately 6 meters behind the ego vehicle. While its velocity is higher, both vehicles are decelerating, with the obstacle decelerating at a faster rate.

4. **Collision determination:** Although the distance is decreasing, the deceleration rates suggest a collision is unlikely in the very near future.  However, continued monitoring is necessary.

5. **Reasoning:** No collision has occurred. While obstacle 20039.0 presents a medium risk, the risk is not imminent due to the deceleration of both vehicles.
