### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. Ego is moving at a moderate speed (~1.6 units/s) and decelerating slightly.
2. Most obstacles are static and far away from the ego's trajectory.
3. Obstacles 20036.0, 20037.0, and 20039.0 are in the same lanelet as ego but are either decelerating or at a safe distance.
4. No immediate collision risk detected based on current positions and trajectories.
