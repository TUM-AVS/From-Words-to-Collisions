### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 20036.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is far from ego and stationary.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Obstacle is stationary, posing no immediate time-related risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 20037.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is moderately far from the ego vehicle and decelerating.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason:  Obstacle is decelerating, reducing the risk over time.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- Obstacle ID: 20039.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is behind the ego but closing the distance quickly.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: Although decelerating, the high speed and closing distance present a moderate time-based risk.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3


### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
No obstacle poses an immediate collision risk. All obstacles are in the same lanelet and have similar orientations. The ego vehicle maintains a safe distance from Obstacle 20036.0 and 20037.0, which are also slowing down. Obstacle 20039.0 is approaching the ego from behind at a higher speed, requiring monitoring, but it's also decelerating, mitigating the immediate risk. Therefore, this is not a collision scenario.


### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
  "CollisionObstacles": [],
  "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null,
  "ScenarioAnalysis": {
    "IsCollisionScenario": false,
    "Reasoning": "No obstacle poses an immediate collision risk. All obstacles are moving in the same direction, and though obstacle 20039.0 is approaching from behind at higher speed, both it and the ego are decelerating within a safe margin."
  }
