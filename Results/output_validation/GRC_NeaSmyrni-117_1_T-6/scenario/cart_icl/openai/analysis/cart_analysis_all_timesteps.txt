### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: 

### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 20036.0**
  - *Distance Risk reason*: The obstacle has shown minimal movement over time, almost stationary in the same lanelet as the ego. The changes in position are negligible, indicating very low proximity movement.
  - *Distance safety score*: 5
  - *Time Risk reason*: The obstacle's velocity has decreased to zero and maintains zero acceleration, indicating no imminent movement towards the ego vehicle.
  - *Time safety score*: 5
  - *Overall Risk score*: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 20037.0**
  - *Distance Risk reason*: Moderate velocity slowing over time. Its trajectory shows decreasing speeds and no significant close proximity to the ego vehicle.
  - *Distance safety score*: 4
  - *Time Risk reason*: With a continuously reducing velocity and a moderately conservative acceleration, itâ€™s moving progressively slower.
  - *Time safety score*: 4
  - *Overall Risk score*: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 20039.0**
  - *Distance Risk reason*: This obstacle shows consistent high-speed movement but at a significant distance from the ego vehicle, with no rapid approach.
  - *Distance safety score*: 4
  - *Time Risk reason*: While high velocity, the relative distance is maintained without drastic acceleration changes. The obstacle is not accelerating towards the ego vehicle.
  - *Time safety score*: 4
  - *Overall Risk score*: 4

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
- **No collision scenario evident**: All obstacles show manageable distances and velocities relative to the ego vehicle, with no sudden acceleration changes or directional shifts indicating a potential for collision. The stationary nature of Obstacle 20036.0 poses no threat, and the deceleration tendencies in Obstacle 20037.0 and the constant speed of Obstacle 20039.0 allow for sufficient time and space to react. Thus, this is not considered a collision scenario.
