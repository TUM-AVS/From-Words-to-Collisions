Obstacle 20039 is in a collision state with the ego vehicle, as indicated by the "Collision" motion status and a longitudinal distance of 0.00 m. This obstacle poses the highest risk.

Obstacle 20037 is in front of the ego vehicle at a longitudinal distance of 14.29 m and approaching with a relative velocity of -1.09 m/s and relative acceleration of -0.42 m/s².  While not immediately colliding, it represents a potential future risk if the ego vehicle were to brake suddenly or if Obstacle 20037 were to accelerate towards the ego vehicle.

Obstacle 20036 is further ahead at 21.49 m with a relative velocity of -1.60 m/s and a relative acceleration of 0.05 m/s². The positive relative acceleration indicates that the closing speed between Obstacle 20036 and the ego vehicle is decreasing, suggesting a slightly reduced risk compared to Obstacle 20037.


**Risk Levels and Definitions:**
<Collision (Score: 0)>: Actual collision has occurred or is unavoidable within the next timestep.
<Extreme Risk (Score: 1)>: Immediate collision or very high likelihood of impact. Urgent action is required.
<High Risk (Score: 2)>: Close to collision or highly probable collision path. Needs prompt attention and quick manoeuvring.
<Medium Risk (Score: 3)>: Moderate collision risk but manageable with timely reactions and proper strategies.
<Low Risk (Score: 4)>: Minimal collision risk. The situation is controllable with sufficient time to react.
<Negligible Risk (Score: 5)>: No significant collision risk. Obstacles are either moving away or far enough not to interfere.
