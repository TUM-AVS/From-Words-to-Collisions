### Safety analysis for timestep 2.7s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- **Obstacle ID:** 20036
- **Distance Risk reason:** The obstacle is 23.01m in front of the ego vehicle, presenting no immediate risk given the lateral distance is also substantial.
- **Distance safety score:** 5
- **Time Risk reason:**  Approaching at -1.67 m/s but decelerating at -0.14 m/s².  TTC is high, indicating low risk currently.
- **Time safety score:** 4
- **Overall Risk score:** 4

- **Obstacle ID:** 20037
- **Distance Risk reason:**  Closer than Obstacle 20036 at 15.04m but still at a safe distance longitudinally and laterally.
- **Distance safety score:** 4
- **Time Risk reason:** Approaching slowly at -0.49 m/s and decelerating at -0.61 m/s². Low risk.
- **Time safety score:** 4
- **Overall Risk score:** 4

- **Obstacle ID:** 20039
- **Distance Risk reason:** Very close behind the ego vehicle at -3.79m. High risk of collision.
- **Distance safety score:** 2
- **Time Risk reason:**  Approaching rapidly from behind at 5.59 m/s although decelerating. High risk.
- **Time safety score:** 2
- **Overall Risk score:** 2

### Safety analysis for timestep 2.8s - 3.4s:
(Similar analysis structure as for 2.7s, with decreasing distances and TTC values, especially for Obstacle 20039. Risk scores for Obstacle 20039 will progressively decrease, while the other obstacles remain relatively safe.  Detailed breakdowns omitted for brevity, but the principle remains the same: assess based on distance, TTC, and relative motion.)

### Safety analysis for timestep 3.5s:
- **Obstacle ID:** 20036
- **Distance Risk reason:** Still a safe distance away.
- **Distance safety score:** 5
- **Time Risk reason:**  Low risk.
- **Time safety score:** 4
- **Overall Risk score:** 4

- **Obstacle ID:** 20037
- **Distance Risk reason:** Moderately safe distance.
- **Distance safety score:** 4
- **Time Risk reason:** Low risk.
- **Time safety score:** 4
- **Overall Risk score:** 4

- **Obstacle ID:** 20039
- **Distance Risk reason:** Collision reported.
- **Distance safety score:** 0
- **Time Risk reason:** Collision has occurred.
- **Time safety score:** 0
- **Overall Risk score:** 0


### Safety analysis for timestep 3.6s:
(Similar to 3.5s for Obstacles 20036 and 20037. Obstacle 20039 remains in a collision state.)
