**Obstacle-by-Obstacle Analysis:**

### Obstacle 20036:
- **Position at Latest Timestep (3.6 seconds):** Longitudinal 21.49 m, Lateral 0.00 m
- **Relative Velocity:** Longitudinal -1.60 m/s (approaching), Lateral 0.00 m/s
- **Trajectory:** Continues to approach the ego car mainly in the longitudinal direction.
- **TTC Calculation:**
  - **TTC Longitudinal:** = 21.49 m / 1.60 m/s = 13.43 seconds
- **MDC Calculation:**
  - **MDC Longitudinal:** ≈ 21.49 m (since lateral is 0.00 m, focus on longitudinal)
- **Risk Assessment:** No Risk as TTC and MDC both indicate no imminent collision.

### Obstacle 20037:
- **Position at Latest Timestep (3.6 seconds):** Longitudinal 14.29 m, Lateral 0.00 m
- **Relative Velocity:** Longitudinal -1.09 m/s (approaching), Lateral 0.00 m/s
- **Trajectory:** Continues to approach the ego car mainly longitudinally.
- **TTC Calculation:**
  - **TTC Longitudinal:** = 14.29 m / 1.09 m/s = 13.11 seconds
- **MDC Calculation:**
  - **MDC Longitudinal:** ≈ 14.29 m (since lateral is 0.00 m, focus on longitudinal)
- **Risk Assessment:** No Risk as TTC and MDC both indicate no imminent collision.

### Obstacle 20039:
- **Position at Latest Timestep (3.6 seconds):** Longitudinal 0.00 m, Lateral 0.00 m
- **Relative Velocity:** Longitudinal 3.92 m/s (moving towards in both directions)
- **Trajectory:** In a collision with the ego car as indicated by a position of 0.00 m in both dimensions.
- **TTC and MDC Calculation:**
  - **TTC:** = 0.00 m / 3.92 m/s = 0 seconds (actual collision)
  - **MDC:** = 0 meters
- **Risk Assessment:** Collision occurring as both longitudinal and lateral distances are 0.00 m, with an approaching velocity and the fact that they've been closing over time.

**Conclusion:**
Obstacle 20039 is in a collision state with the ego vehicle since the distances in both the longitudinal and lateral dimensions are zero, indicating actual contact, and has a relative velocity pointing towards the ego car. This is a clear collision scenario.
