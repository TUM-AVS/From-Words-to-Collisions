### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
    - Obstacle ID: 20036
    - Relative Direction: Front
    - Distance Risk Reason: DTClong is 21.49m, which is > 5, indicating negligible risk longitudinally. DTClat is 0.0m, but since the direction is Front, the lateral component isn't dominant. The obstacle has been approaching ego car longitudinally.
    - Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 5
    - Lateral Distance Safety Score: 0
    - Overall Distance Safety Score: 5.0
    - Time Risk Reason: TTClong is 13.43s, which is > 5, indicating negligible risk. TTClat is 0.0s, but since the direction is Front, the lateral component isn't dominant.  TTClong has been decreasing consistently across timesteps, but still very high.
    - Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 5
    - Lateral Time Safety Score: 0
    - Overall Time Safety Score: 5.0
    - Overall Risk Score: 5

    - Obstacle ID: 20037
    - Relative Direction: Front
    - Distance Risk Reason: DTClong is 14.29m, which is > 5, indicating negligible risk longitudinally. DTClat is 0.0m, but since the direction is Front, the lateral component isn't dominant. The obstacle has been approaching ego car longitudinally.
    - Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 5
    - Lateral Distance Safety Score: 0
    - Overall Distance Safety Score: 5.0
    - Time Risk Reason: TTClong is 13.09s, which is > 5, indicating negligible risk. TTClat is 0.0s, but since the direction is Front, the lateral component isn't dominant. TTClong has been consistently decreasing across timesteps.
    - Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 5
    - Lateral Time Safety Score: 0
    - Overall Time Safety Score: 5.0
    - Overall Risk Score: 5

    - Obstacle ID: 20039
    - Relative Direction: Behind
    - Distance Risk Reason: DTClong is 0.0m indicating a collision. DTClat is 0.0m, but since the direction is Behind, the lateral component isn't dominant. The obstacle has been approaching ego car longitudinally from behind and has now collided.
    - Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 0
    - Lateral Distance Safety Score: 0
    - Overall Distance Safety Score: 0.0
    - Time Risk Reason: TTClong is 0.0s, indicating collision. TTClat is 0.0s, but since the direction is Behind, the lateral component isn't dominant. TTC has been decreasing and reached 0 across timesteps.
    - Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 0
    - Lateral Time Safety Score: 0
    - Overall Time Safety Score: 0.0
    - Overall Risk Score: 0
