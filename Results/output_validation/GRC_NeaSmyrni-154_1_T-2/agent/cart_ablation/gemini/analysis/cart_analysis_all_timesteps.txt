Here's the collision risk analysis:

**Obstacle 20063:** This obstacle is stationary far from the ego vehicle, posing no immediate risk. Risk score: 5

**Obstacle 20064:**  This obstacle is almost stationary and far from the ego vehicle, posing no immediate risk. Risk score: 5

**Obstacle 20066:** This obstacle is moving at a higher speed than the ego vehicle, but its y-coordinate is decreasing faster than the ego vehicle's. Although the distance between the two vehicles is decreasing over time, given the current trajectories and the fact that the vehicles are in the same lanelet, there is no immediate risk of collision. Risk score: 3

**Obstacle 20067:** This obstacle, similar to obstacle 20066, is moving faster than the ego vehicle with a decreasing y-coordinate, however the distance between both vehicles remains large enough that there is a sufficient gap between them that given the current trajectories, a collision is not a risk. Risk score: 4
