Obstacle 20066 is showing a concerning trend. While not immediately colliding, its velocity is significantly higher than the ego vehicle's, and both are decelerating. This could lead to a risky situation if the deceleration rates change or if obstacle 20066 does not decelerate sufficiently.  Obstacle 20067 is also moving faster than ego, but poses less immediate risk due to greater distance. The stationary obstacles (20063, 20064) do not pose any risk in the visible future.
