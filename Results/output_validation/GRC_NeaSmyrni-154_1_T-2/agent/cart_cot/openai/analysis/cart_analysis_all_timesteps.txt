### Brief Analysis:

#### Obstacle 20063.0:
- **Position**: Static obstacle, no movement across timesteps.
- **Risk**: Given its constant position and zero velocity, it's primarily a potential hazard if ego makes a future turn or lane adjustment.

#### Obstacle 20064.0:
- **Position**: Static obstacle, no meaningful movement.
- **Risk**: Similar to obstacle 20063.0, poses no direct collision threat unless ego vehicle drastically changes path.

#### Obstacle 20066.0:
- **Velocity Trend**: Consistent deceleration.
- **Risk**: Continuous reduction in speed suggests a potential future stop before collision becomes imminent.

#### Obstacle 20067.0:
- **Velocity Trend**: Consistent deceleration, slightly faster than obstacle 20066.0.
- **Risk**: High velocity and proximity to the ego vehicle require vigilance; however, its deceleration trend is strong, suggesting reduced risk of collision.

Given the positions and velocities, neither obstacle 20063.0 nor 20064.0 pose an immediate risk due to their stationary nature. Obstacles 20066.0 and 20067.0 have movement, but given that the velocities are decreasing and are not in immediate proximity for the next 10 seconds, we can say:

- None of the obstacles in the scenario seem to suggest an unavoidable collision at the assessed timesteps (score of 0).
- No extreme risk of collision is imminent (no score of 1).
- Obstacle 20067.0 is the closest to posing a high risk since it has the highest velocity yet the trend and position do not indicate an imminent crash.
