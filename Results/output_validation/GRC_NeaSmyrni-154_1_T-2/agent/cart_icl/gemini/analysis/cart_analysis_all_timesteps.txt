Obstacle 20066 is showing concerning behavior.  It's approaching the ego vehicle rapidly from behind, with its velocity significantly higher than the ego's. While not an immediate collision risk at this exact moment, the closing speed warrants attention.

Obstacle 20067 is also approaching from behind at high speed, even faster than 20066.  This presents a higher risk, although still not extremely high in the current timestep. Further monitoring is required.

Obstacle 20063 and 20064 appear stationary or nearly so and are located significantly behind and slightly to the side of the ego vehicle, therefore pose no immediate threat.
