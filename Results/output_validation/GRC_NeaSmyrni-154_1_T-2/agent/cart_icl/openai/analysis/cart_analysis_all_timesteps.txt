### Analysis of Risks:

#### Obstacle 20063.0:
- **Position (2.9s):** (-14.9935, -67.8523)
- **Velocity:** 0.0 m/s (stationary)
- **Assessment:** Obstacle remains stationary and has consistently shown no movement across all timesteps, which means it doesn't pose a collision risk to the ego vehicle as long as there is sufficient separation. Closest approach point remains significantly distant. 
    - **Minimum distance to Ego at 2.9s:** ~25.3 meters
    - **Risk Level:** **4 - Low Risk**

#### Obstacle 20064.0:
- **Position (2.9s):** (-16.6245, -74.6381)
- **Velocity:** 0.0 m/s (stationary)
- **Assessment:** Similar to obstacle 20063.0, this obstacle has come to a halt and poses no movement threat. 
    - **Minimum distance to Ego at 2.9s:** ~17.2 meters
    - **Risk Level:** **4 - Low Risk**

#### Obstacle 20066.0:
- **Position (2.9s):** (-21.7874, -96.1180)
- **Velocity:** 5.6559 m/s (decelerating)
- **Assessment:** This vehicle is moving positively with significant deceleration. Itâ€™s in the same lanelet but is moving faster away from the ego vehicle.
    - **Distance to Ego at 2.9s:** ~5 meters
    - **Risk Level:** **3 - Medium Risk**

#### Obstacle 20067.0:
- **Position (2.9s):** (-25.2223, -110.4088)
- **Velocity:** 7.7895 m/s (decelerating)
- **Assessment:** This vehicle is also moving away from the ego vehicle and braking; whilst in the same lanelet, it does not pose an immediate collision course at this time.
    - **Distance to Ego at 2.9s:** ~17 meters
    - **Risk Level:** **4 - Low Risk**

Based on this scenario, no obstacles present an immediate critical risk (0) or extreme risk (1) to the ego vehicle as of the last timestamp (2.9 seconds), given their speeds, accelerations, and distances. Continuous monitoring by autonomous systems is recommended for maintaining safe distances.
