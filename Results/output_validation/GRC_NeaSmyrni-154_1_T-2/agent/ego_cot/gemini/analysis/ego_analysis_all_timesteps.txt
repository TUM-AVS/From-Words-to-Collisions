### Safety analysis for timestep 2.9 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

It's crucial to note that the provided scenario information lacks crucial data for accurate TTC and MDC calculation. We need the ego vehicle's speed and acceleration, along with precise lateral positions (not just distances) of the obstacles relative to the ego vehicle.  The "Exact lateral alignment or unknown case" statement makes accurate lateral risk assessment impossible.  The following analysis relies heavily on assumptions due to this missing information. It is primarily based on proximity, as calculating the accurate TTC and MDC is not possible with this limited data.

**Assumptions:**

* **Lateral Movement:**  We cannot accurately compute TTC_lat or MDC_lat without lateral positions. The analysis assumes the lateral distances are the minimum distances and that a collision is possible if these distances continue to decrease while the longitudinal distance also decreases.
* **Ego Vehicle Motion:** I will assume the ego vehicle maintains a constant velocity for simplification. While unrealistic, it's the best we can do without more data.

### Obstacle Analysis:

**- Obstacle ID: 20063**
- Distance Risk reason:  In front, 19.64m longitudinal and 19.64m lateral distance suggests no immediate risk. However, the obstacle is approaching longitudinally.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Unable to accurately calculate without ego vehicle speed and obstacle's precise trajectory. The closing longitudinal velocity suggests a potential risk in the future.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

**- Obstacle ID: 20064**
- Distance Risk reason:  In front, 12.66m longitudinal and 12.66m lateral distance suggests no immediate risk. However, the obstacle is approaching longitudinally.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Unable to accurately calculate without ego vehicle speed and obstacle's precise trajectory. The closing longitudinal velocity suggests a potential risk in the future.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3

**- Obstacle ID: 20066**
- Distance Risk reason: Behind, -0.41m longitudinal and -0.41m lateral distance indicates extremely high risk of collision. The negative sign indicates the obstacle is likely very close or overlapping with the ego vehicle's rear.
- Distance safety score: 1
- Time Risk reason: While the obstacle is approaching from behind, the small longitudinal distance indicates a potential for immediate collision if the ego vehicle brakes or changes trajectory.  Accurate calculation impossible without velocity data.
- Time safety score: 1
- Overall Risk score: 1

**- Obstacle ID: 20067**
- Distance Risk reason: Behind, -15.11m longitudinal and -15.11m lateral distance indicates no immediate risk. However, the obstacle is approaching longitudinally from behind.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason:  While approaching from behind, the large longitudinal distance indicates a lower risk for now. Accurate TTC calculation impossible without velocity data.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4
