* At t=2.9s:
    * **Obstacle 20063:** Front, longitudinal 19.64m, lateral 0.00m. Relative velocity: longitudinal -1.34 m/s, lateral -0.00 m/s.
        * TTC_longitudinal = 19.64m / 1.34m/s = 14.66s. Risk: Negligible.
        * MDC: Since lateral distance is 0.00m and the obstacle is in front, the MDC is primarily based on the longitudinal distance (19.64m), but we need to confirm the longitudinal trajectory. Across the timesteps, the longitudinal distance is decreasing but slowly. Risk: Negligible.
        * Overall Risk: 5 (Negligible Risk)
    * **Obstacle 20064:** Front, longitudinal 12.66m, lateral 0.00m. Relative velocity: longitudinal -1.34 m/s, lateral -0.00 m/s.
        * TTC_longitudinal = 12.66m / 1.34m/s = 9.45s. Risk: Negligible.
        * MDC: Similar to Obstacle 20063, the MDC is primarily 12.66m. The longitudinal distance is decreasing slowly. Risk: Negligible.
        * Overall Risk: 5 (Negligible Risk)

    * **Obstacle 20066:** Behind, longitudinal -0.41m, lateral 0.00m. Relative velocity: longitudinal 4.31 m/s, lateral -0.00 m/s.
        * TTC_longitudinal = 0.41m / 4.31 m/s = 0.095s. Risk: Extreme Risk.
        * MDC: Since lateral distance is 0.00m and the obstacle is behind, MDC is primarily 0.41m. The longitudinal distance is rapidly decreasing and close to zero.  Risk: Extreme Risk.
        * Overall Risk: 1 (Extreme Risk)

    * **Obstacle 20067:** Behind, longitudinal -15.11m, lateral 0.00m. Relative velocity: longitudinal 6.45 m/s, lateral -0.00 m/s.
        * TTC_longitudinal = 15.11m / 6.45m/s = 2.34s. Risk: Medium.
        * MDC: MDC is primarily 15.11m. Risk: Negligible.
        * Overall Risk: 3 (Medium Risk)
