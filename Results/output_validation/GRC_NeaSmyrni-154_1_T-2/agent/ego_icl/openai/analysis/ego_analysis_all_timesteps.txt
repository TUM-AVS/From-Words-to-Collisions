To analyze the risk of collision between the ego vehicle and the obstacles based on the most recent timestep (2.9 seconds), we will assess each obstacle, calculate TTC and MDC, and determine risk levels as instructed.

---

### Obstacle 20063 (Front)

**Trajectory Analysis Across Timesteps:**
- Positions from 2.0 to 2.9 seconds consistently indicate closing longitudinal distance.
- Relative velocity is negative (-1.34 m/s), indicating the obstacle is moving toward the ego vehicle.

**Adjusted Distance at 2.9 seconds:**
- Longitudinal: 19.64 m 
- Lateral: 0.00 m

**Risk Assessment:**
- **TTC Calculation:** \( TTC = \frac{19.64 \text{ m}}{1.34 \text{ m/s}} \approx 14.66 \text{ seconds} \)
- **MDC Analysis:** MDC is derived from the adjusted longitudinal distance, as the lateral is 0.00 m (same lane but far enough).
- As TTC > 5 seconds, this translates to a negligible risk level for collision assuming velocities remain unchanged.

**Risk Level:** Negligible Risk (5)

### Obstacle 20064 (Front)

**Trajectory Analysis Across Timesteps:**
- Positions from 2.0 to 2.9 seconds show a reducing longitudinal distance.
- The relative velocity is also negative (-1.34 m/s), suggesting the obstacle is approaching the ego car.

**Adjusted Distance at 2.9 seconds:**
- Longitudinal: 12.66 m
- Lateral: 0.00 m

**Risk Assessment:**
- **TTC Calculation:** \( TTC = \frac{12.66 \text{ m}}{1.34 \text{ m/s}} \approx 9.45 \text{ seconds} \)
- **MDC Analysis:** With a gradually closing longitudinal distance, the risk is low.
- TTC > 5 seconds denotes a negligible risk assuming stable velocities.

**Risk Level:** Negligible Risk (5)

### Obstacle 20066 (Behind)

**Trajectory Analysis Across Timesteps:**
- The obstacle is closing from behind, with decreasing negative longitudinal distances and positive velocities.
- Relative velocity trend shows it moving toward the ego car at 4.31 m/s.

**Adjusted Distance at 2.9 seconds:**
- Longitudinal: 0.41 m behind
- Lateral: 0.00 m

**Risk Assessment:**
- **TTC Calculation:** \( TTC = \frac{0.41 \text{ m}}{4.31 \text{ m/s}} \approx 0.095 \text{ seconds} \)
- **MDC Analysis:** Extremely short MDC (0.41 m behind), indicating an imminent collision risk from behind.

**Risk Level:** Extreme Risk (1)
- Due to very short TTC and rapid approach, this poses an immediate threat.

### Obstacle 20067 (Behind)

**Trajectory Analysis Across Timesteps:**
- The obstacle reduces its distance from the back as it continues approaching.
- A positive relative velocity persists at 6.45 m/s.

**Adjusted Distance at 2.9 seconds:**
- Longitudinal: 15.11 m behind
- Lateral: 0.00 m

**Risk Assessment:**
- **TTC Calculation:** TTC results in a longer duration given the relative position and speed.
- **MDC Analysis:** At over 15 m, MDC is not concerning immediately, given TTC > 5 seconds.

**Risk Level:** Low Risk (4)
