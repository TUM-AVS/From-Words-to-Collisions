At t=3.1s, Ego's position is (-20.5747, -91.0726) and its velocity is decreasing.

Obstacle 20063: Position (-14.9935, -67.8523), velocity 0.  This obstacle is far from Ego and poses no immediate risk.

Obstacle 20064: Position (-16.6245, -74.6381), velocity 0.  This obstacle is also far from Ego and poses no immediate risk.

Obstacle 20066: Position (-21.5329, -95.059), velocity 5.2422.  While this obstacle is behind Ego, its high velocity and Ego's decreasing velocity warrant attention.  The y-coordinate difference is concerning. If both vehicles maintain their current trajectories and accelerations, a collision is possible. This warrants a High Risk (2) classification.

Obstacle 20067: Position (-24.8667, -108.9291), velocity 7.42. This obstacle is significantly behind and further along the lanelet than the Ego vehicle, presenting no immediate risk.

Since no obstacle presents an immediate (score 1) or certain collision (score 0) risk,  IsCollisionScenario is false. Obstacle 20066 requires monitoring due to its relatively high velocity while approaching Ego from behind.
