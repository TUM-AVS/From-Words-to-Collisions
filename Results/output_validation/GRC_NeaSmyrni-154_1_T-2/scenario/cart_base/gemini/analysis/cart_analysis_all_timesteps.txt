At t=3.1s, Ego is at (-20.57, -91.07) with velocity 1.26 m/s.  Obstacle 20066 is at (-21.53, -95.06) with velocity 5.24 m/s and decelerating at -2.00 m/s². Obstacle 20067 is at (-24.87, -108.93) with velocity 7.42 m/s and decelerating at -1.93 m/s².

Obstacle 20066 is the closest and poses the most significant risk. While it's behind Ego, its considerably higher velocity, even with deceleration, suggests a potential for a rear-end collision in the near future if the deceleration rates remain constant or if Ego decelerates more aggressively.  Given the closing speeds and distances, this is evaluated as an Extreme Risk (1).

Obstacle 20067 is further behind and despite its higher velocity, has more distance to cover. While a risk, it doesn't present an immediate danger at this moment, placing it at a higher risk score than 1.
