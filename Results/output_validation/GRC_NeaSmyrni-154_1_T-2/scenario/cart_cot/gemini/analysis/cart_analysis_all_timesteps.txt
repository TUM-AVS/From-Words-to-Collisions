### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 20063.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is far from the ego vehicle and stationary.  Historical data shows it has remained stationary throughout the scenario.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason:  Obstacle is stationary, posing no immediate time-related risk. Historical data confirms this.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 20064.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is moderately far from the ego vehicle and nearly stationary. Historical data indicates it has slowed to a stop.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Obstacle is nearly stationary, posing minimal time-related risk.  History shows decreasing velocity.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- Obstacle ID: 20066.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is relatively close to the ego vehicle, but the distance is increasing.  Historical data confirms a separating trend.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason:  Obstacle is moving faster than the ego vehicle, but decelerating. Historical data shows this deceleration trend, reducing risk over time.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3

- Obstacle ID: 20067.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is furthest from the ego vehicle and the distance is increasing. Historical data shows this increasing trend.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Although the obstacle is moving faster than the ego vehicle, it is decelerating and the large distance mitigates time-related risk.  Historical data confirms this.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 5


### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. **Most critical obstacle:** Obstacle 20066.0 presented the highest risk due to its proximity and higher velocity relative to the ego vehicle.
2. **Trajectory Analysis:** Over the 10 timesteps, all obstacles except 20066.0 and 20067.0 are either stationary or have come to a stop. Obstacles 20066.0 and 20067.0 are moving in roughly the same direction as the ego vehicle but are decelerating.  Crucially, the distance between the ego vehicle and these obstacles is increasing over time.
3. **Relative Position, Velocity, and Acceleration:** The ego vehicle is decelerating. The most important factor is that all obstacles are either stationary or moving away from the ego vehicle. Even though 20066.0 has a higher speed, its decelerating nature and increasing distance from the ego vehicle lessen the risk.
4. **Collision Determination:** No collision has occurred, and none is imminent based on the observed trajectories and the fact that separation distances are increasing.
5. **Reasoning:** The combination of increasing distances and the decelerating nature of the relevant obstacles strongly suggests that the scenario is not leading to a collision.


### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
  "CollisionObstacles": null,
  "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null,
  "ScenarioAnalysis": {
    "IsCollisionScenario": false,
    "Reasoning": "No collision is detected or predicted.  All obstacles are either stationary or moving away from the ego vehicle with increasing separation distances over time. Although obstacle 20066.0 initially posed a higher risk due to its proximity and velocity, its decelerating behavior and increasing distance from the ego vehicle mitigate this risk."
