### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 20063.0
- Distance Risk reason: Stationary and far from ego vehicle's trajectory.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: No relative motion poses no immediate threat.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 20064.0
- Distance Risk reason: Stationary and far from ego vehicle's trajectory.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: No relative motion poses no immediate threat.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 20066.0
- Distance Risk reason: Although moving, it maintains a safe distance behind and gradually decelerating.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Decelerating reduces collision risk.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- Obstacle ID: 20067.0
- Distance Risk reason: Furthest obstacle, maintaining a safe distance and decelerating.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Decelerating reduces collision risk further.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
Analyzing the provided data across the last 10 timesteps shows no imminent collision risk. All obstacles are either stationary or moving away from the ego vehicle. Additionally, obstacles 20066.0 and 20067.0 are decelerating, further reducing any potential risk. The ego vehicle is also decelerating slightly but maintains a safe following distance. Therefore, this is not a collision scenario.
