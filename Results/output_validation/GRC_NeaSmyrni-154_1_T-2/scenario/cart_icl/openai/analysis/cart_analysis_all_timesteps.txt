### Obstacle Analysis:

**Obstacle 20063.0:**
- **Distance Risk reason:** The obstacle has remained stationary over the evaluated time span and is located at a significant distance from the ego vehicle. 
- **Distance safety score:** 5
- **Time Risk reason:** No velocity and acceleration; hence, no threat of collision dynamically. 
- **Time safety score:** 5
- **Overall Risk score:** 5

**Obstacle 20064.0:**
- **Distance Risk reason:** The obstacle also remained almost stationary and maintained a consistent distance from the ego vehicle.
- **Distance safety score:** 5
- **Time Risk reason:** Minimal movement with zero velocity indicates no collision threat.
- **Time safety score:** 5
- **Overall Risk score:** 5

**Obstacle 20066.0:**
- **Distance Risk reason:** This obstacle is moving towards the ego but is on a converging trajectory and gradually reducing distance due to relatively high velocity.
- **Distance safety score:** 3
- **Time Risk reason:** The obstacle continues to decelerate but still poses a moderate time risk due to its higher velocity.
- **Time safety score:** 3
- **Overall Risk score:** 3

**Obstacle 20067.0:**
- **Distance Risk reason:** Obstacle's rapid deceleration indicates it’s moving away from the ego vehicle over time.
- **Distance safety score:** 4
- **Time Risk reason:** Despite high initial velocity, it’s decelerating significantly indicating minimal time risk.
- **Time safety score:** 4
- **Overall Risk score:** 4

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
The ego vehicle and obstacles are all within the same lanelet, yet none of the obstacles present a high immediate threat. The obstacle's orientations are in line with the ego's, and they are mostly stationary with little velocity change or ones that are accelerating and moving further away. Calculations of TTC and MDC indicate safe margins.
