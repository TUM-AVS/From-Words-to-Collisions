### Safety analysis for timestep 2.2s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 20063
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is in front, longitudinally 20.83m away.  Lateral distance is also significant.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Approaching ego but relative velocity is low and decelerating.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- Obstacle ID: 20064
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is in front, longitudinally 13.85m away. Lateral distance is also significant.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Approaching ego but relative velocity is low and decelerating.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- Obstacle ID: 20066
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is behind and very close longitudinally (-3.71m). Lateral distance also very close.
- Distance safety score: 2
- Time Risk reason:  Rapidly approaching from behind.
- Time safety score: 2
- Overall Risk score: 2

- Obstacle ID: 20067
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is behind, longitudinally -19.79m away. Lateral distance also significant.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Approaching from behind but relatively far.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4


### Safety analysis for timestep 2.3s - 2.9s: Similar analysis as 2.2s, with distances decreasing, particularly for Obstacle 20066 approaching from behind.  Risk levels generally remain the same until 3.0s, though Obstacle 20066 progressively becomes a higher risk.  Detailed calculations and explanations would follow the same pattern as for 2.2s.  We'll skip these intermediate steps for brevity and focus on the crucial moment of collision at 3.0s.

### Safety analysis for timestep 3.0s:

- Obstacle ID: 20063
- Distance Risk reason:  In front, longitudinally 19.51m. No immediate risk.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason:  Slowly approaching.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- Obstacle ID: 20064
- Distance Risk reason: In front, longitudinally 12.53m. No immediate risk.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Slowly approaching.
- Time safety score: 4

- Obstacle ID: 20066
- Distance Risk reason: Collision reported (0m longitudinal and lateral distance).
- Distance safety score: 0
- Time Risk reason:  Collision occurred.
- Time safety score: 0
- Overall Risk score: 0

- Obstacle ID: 20067
- Distance Risk reason: Behind, -14.48m longitudinally. No immediate risk.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason:  Approaching from behind, but still a safe distance.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4
