* **Obstacle 20063 (Front):**  This obstacle has maintained a lateral distance of 0.00m throughout all timesteps, indicating longitudinal alignment in the same lane. The longitudinal distance has decreased slightly over time, but remains large at 19.37m in the last timestep. The relative longitudinal velocity is -1.26 m/s, showing that it's moving away from the ego vehicle.  Given the large distance and negative relative velocity, there is no risk of collision.
    * TTC (longitudinal): Not applicable due to negative relative velocity.
    * MDC: ~19.37m (using longitudinal distance as a safe estimate given the lateral alignment and motion description).
    * Risk Score: 5 (No Risk)

* **Obstacle 20064 (Front):** Similar to Obstacle 20063, this obstacle also maintains a lateral distance of 0.00m (longitudinal alignment in the same lane). The longitudinal distance is 12.39m in the final timestep, and the relative longitudinal velocity is -1.26 m/s meaning it's moving away from the ego vehicle. There is no risk of collision.
    * TTC (longitudinal): Not applicable due to negative relative velocity.
    * MDC: ~12.39m (using longitudinal distance due to the lateral alignment and motion description).
    * Risk Score: 5 (No Risk)

* **Obstacle 20066 (Collision/Behind):** This obstacle started behind the ego vehicle and has been rapidly approaching.  It has consistent lateral alignment (0.00m) and the longitudinal distance becomes 0.00m at time 3.0s and remains at 0.00 at 3.1s. The relative longitudinal velocity remains positive which indicates collision if based purely on the numbers. However, the motion description at time 3.1s reports "Exact longitudinal alignment or co". It means both vehicles are very close to collision and potentially collided but cannot confirm with the given dataset. More context and data are needed to definitively declare collision. Conservatively, we assume a collision.
    * TTC (longitudinal): Not applicable since longitudinal distance is 0.00m.
    * MDC: 0.00m
    * Risk Score: 0 (Collision) 

* **Obstacle 20067 (Behind):** This obstacle is behind the ego vehicle and approaching, but at a larger distance than Obstacle 20066. The lateral distance is consistently 0.00m and the longitudinal distance remains large (-13.86m) in the last timestamp. The relative longitudinal velocity is 6.16 m/s which means it's closing. While approaching, the large distance suggests no immediate collision risk.
    * TTC (longitudinal): 13.86m / 6.16 m/s â‰ˆ 2.25s
    * MDC: ~13.86m (using longitudinal distance).
    * Risk Score: 3 (Medium Risk)

**Collision Scenario Determination:** Yes, this is a collision scenario. Obstacle 20066 has a risk score of 0 (Collision) at time 3.0s and then at time 3.1s the motion description is "Exact longitudinal alignment or co". It means both vehicles are very close to collision and cannot confirm collision yet with the given dataset.  While more data is needed, the scenario up to the available data must be classified as a collision.
