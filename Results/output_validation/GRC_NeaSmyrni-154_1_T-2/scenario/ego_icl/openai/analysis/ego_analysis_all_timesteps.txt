**Obstacle-by-Obstacle Analysis at 3.1 seconds:**

### Obstacle 20063
- **Position**: In the Front
- **Adjusted Distance**: Longitudinal 19.37 m, Lateral 0.00 m
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal -1.26 m/s, Lateral -0.00 m/s
- **Trajectory Analysis**: Obstacle continually approaches, reducing longitudinal distance steadily with each timestep.
- **TTC Calculation**: \( \text{TTC} = \frac{19.37}{1.26} \approx 15.37 \text{ seconds} \)
- **MDC Assessment**: Longitudinal distance decreasing, but still greater than 5 meters. Lateral alignment but not near-zero in both dimensions.
- **Risk Score**: No Risk (5). The obstacle is aligned laterally but far in front with a decreasing but sufficient TTC. 

### Obstacle 20064
- **Position**: In the Front
- **Adjusted Distance**: Longitudinal 12.39 m, Lateral 0.00 m
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal -1.26 m/s, Lateral -0.00 m/s
- **Trajectory Analysis**: Continues to close in at a steady rate.
- **TTC Calculation**: \( \text{TTC} = \frac{12.39}{1.26} \approx 9.83 \text{ seconds} \)
- **MDC Assessment**: Longitudinal distance is reducing but safe for the present.
- **Risk Score**: No Risk (5). Despite the decreasing distance, the time to potential collision is safe.

### Obstacle 20066
- **Position**: Exact Collision
- **Adjusted Distance**: Longitudinal 0.00 m, Lateral 0.00 m
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal 3.98 m/s, Lateral -0.00 m/s
- **Trajectory Analysis**: Obstacle 20066 has reached 0m distance in both dimensions indicating an existing collision.
- **TTC Calculation**: Not applicable, already in contact.
- **MDC Assessment**: Distance is zero in both directions, indicating overlap and collision.
- **Risk Score**: Collision (0). The situation directly presents a collision occurring.

### Obstacle 20067
- **Position**: Behind
- **Adjusted Distance**: Longitudinal -13.86 m, Lateral 0.00 m
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal 6.16 m/s, Lateral -0.00 m/s
- **Trajectory Analysis**: Closing in from behind with velocity consistently decreasing towards the ego vehicle.
- **TTC Calculation**: Absolute value of distance required for relative approach speed, meaning calculation would align when positive.
- **MDC Assessment**: Longitudinal distance is negative but indicating position behind and closing.
- **Risk Score**: Low Risk (4). No immediate danger but requires monitoring due to closing velocity.

**Collision Scenario Determination:**
- Obstacle 20066 is currently in a collision state at the last time step (t = 3.1 seconds).
- Collision is occurring due to overlap in both dimensions, confirming high severity.
  
**Conclusion:**
- This scenario is a collision scenario because Obstacle 20066 presents an ongoing collision.
