### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
    - Obstacle ID: 20063
    - Relative Direction: Front
    - Distance Risk Reason: DTClong is >5 indicating negligible longitudinal risk. DTClat is 0 indicating no lateral risk as the obstacle is directly in front. The obstacle has been approaching longitudinally over the past timesteps.
    - Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 5
    - Lateral Distance Safety Score: 5
    - Overall Distance Safety Score: 5.0
    - Time Risk Reason: TTClong is >5, indicating negligible longitudinal risk. TTClat is 0 indicating no lateral risk. The obstacle is moving towards the ego vehicle but the TTC suggests ample time to react.
    - Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 5
    - Lateral Time Safety Score: 5
    - Overall Time Safety Score: 5.0
    - Overall Risk Score: 5

    - Obstacle ID: 20064
    - Relative Direction: Front
    - Distance Risk Reason: DTClong is >5 indicating negligible longitudinal risk, even though decreasing. DTClat is 0, meaning no lateral risk. The obstacle is approaching ego longitudinally over the past timesteps
    - Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 5
    - Lateral Distance Safety Score: 5
    - Overall Distance Safety Score: 5.0
    - Time Risk Reason: TTClong is >5, indicating negligible longitudinal risk. TTClat is 0 indicating no lateral risk. Though TTC is decreasing, it remains high.
    - Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 5
    - Lateral Time Safety Score: 5
    - Overall Time Safety Score: 5.0
    - Overall Risk Score: 5

    - Obstacle ID: 20066
    - Relative Direction: Behind
    - Distance Risk Reason: DTClong is 0, meaning a collision has occurred longitudinally.  DTClat is 0 meaning no lateral movement from behind. Previous timesteps show obstacle 20066 approaching continuously.
    - Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 0
    - Lateral Distance Safety Score: 5
    - Overall Distance Safety Score: 0.0
    - Time Risk Reason: TTClong is 0 meaning a longitudinal collision.  TTClat is 0 meaning no lateral movement. Previous timesteps showed the TTC rapidly decreasing
    - Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 0
    - Lateral Time Safety Score: 5
    - Overall Time Safety Score: 0.0
    - Overall Risk Score: 0

    - Obstacle ID: 20067
    - Relative Direction: Behind
    - Distance Risk Reason: DTClong is > 5, though negative as it's behind and decreasing. DTClat is 0 meaning no lateral risk. The obstacle has been approaching ego from behind across the past timesteps.
    - Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 5
    - Lateral Distance Safety Score: 5
    - Overall Distance Safety Score: 5.0
    - Time Risk Reason: TTClong is between 2 and 3, representing a medium risk. TTClat is 0 indicating no lateral risk. Previous timesteps indicated TTClong slightly decreasing
    - Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 3
    - Lateral Time Safety Score: 5
    - Overall Time Safety Score: 3.0
    - Overall Risk Score: 4
