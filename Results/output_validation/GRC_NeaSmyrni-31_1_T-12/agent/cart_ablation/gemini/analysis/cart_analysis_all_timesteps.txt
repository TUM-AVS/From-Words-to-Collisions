Here's the analysis of the provided scenario:

**Obstacle 20082.0:** This obstacle is moving slower than the ego vehicle and its x-coordinate is significantly smaller than the ego vehicle's across all timesteps.  The distance between the ego vehicle and this obstacle is increasing over time. This obstacle poses no immediate threat. Risk score: 5 (Negligible Risk)

**Obstacle 20084.0:** This obstacle is located behind the ego vehicle initially, but its velocity is considerably higher (almost three times).  Although the distance is decreasing, the closing speed is concerning and requires observation.  Risk score: 3 (Medium Risk)

**Obstacle 20086.0:** This obstacle appears at t=2.6s and maintains a high velocity, higher than Obstacle 20084.0. Its y-coordinate shows that it is farther down the lanelet than the ego vehicle and the other obstacles. Its potential to become a high-risk obstacle later depends on its trajectory. Risk score: 4 (Low Risk)
