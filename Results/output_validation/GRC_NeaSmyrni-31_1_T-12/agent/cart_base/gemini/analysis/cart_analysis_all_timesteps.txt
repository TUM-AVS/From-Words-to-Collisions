Obstacle 20082 is moving slower than the ego vehicle and further away with each timestep. It poses no collision risk.

Obstacle 20084 is moving faster than the ego vehicle, but it's initially further down the lane.  However, its closing rate is high. Looking at the positions, a collision is possible within the next few seconds if current trends continue. This is a high risk.

Obstacle 20086 appears at t=2.6s and is even further down the lane than 20084, but it's moving even faster. While it's not an immediate threat, it's approaching rapidly and needs to be monitored carefully. For now, it represents a medium risk, but could quickly elevate to high risk.
