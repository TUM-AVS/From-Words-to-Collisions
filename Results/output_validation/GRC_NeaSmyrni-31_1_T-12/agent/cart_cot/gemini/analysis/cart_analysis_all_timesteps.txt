Obstacle 20082 is moving slower than the ego vehicle and decelerating more rapidly, posing no immediate threat. Obstacle 20084 is moving faster than the ego vehicle but decelerating.  While the distance between them is decreasing, the deceleration rates suggest the risk is manageable within the near future. Obstacle 20086, despite the higher initial velocity and appearing further down the lane, is decelerating. However, its behavior needs continuous monitoring.

Based on the provided data from the latest timestep (3.4 seconds), the following preliminary assessment can be made about each obstacle's risk level:

* **Obstacle 20082:** Low Risk (4) - Moving slower and decelerating faster than ego, increasing separation.
* **Obstacle 20084:** Medium Risk (3) - Moving faster but decelerating, requiring monitoring due to decreasing separation.
* **Obstacle 20086:** Medium Risk (3) - Further down the road and decelerating; requires monitoring due to the higher speed difference.
