### Brief Analysis:

After analyzing each obstacle's trajectory, position, and motion trends compared to the ego vehicle at the most recent timestep (3.4 seconds):

1. **Obstacle 20082.0** is near the Ego with a dwindling velocity and negative acceleration, indicating deceleration. It is moving further away than initially, reducing immediate collision risk.

2. **Obstacle 20084.0** is heading towards Ego's path more directly and has a downward velocity due to negative acceleration. Its slight orientation change indicates potential for rapid positional change requiring attention.

3. **Obstacle 20086.0** maintains higher velocities compared to others but continues its forward motion and deceleration. It remains the least immediate threat due to the distance despite slightly larger potential for interaction if not adjusted.

At this point, none are at Collision (0) or Extreme Risk (1) levels due to maintained separation and navigation trends, but vigilance is necessary as conditions may evolve quickly.
