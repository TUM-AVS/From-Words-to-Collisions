Obstacle 20082 is in front of the ego vehicle and moving away, posing no immediate risk. It has a longitudinal distance of 17.70 meters and a relative velocity of 0.36 m/s.  This is considered a low risk.

Obstacle 20084 is behind the ego vehicle and approaching rapidly, with a longitudinal distance of -0.84 meters and a relative velocity of 5.24 m/s. Given the close proximity and high closing speed, this obstacle presents an extreme risk of collision.

Obstacle 20086 is behind and to the right of the ego vehicle, approaching both longitudinally and laterally.  It is at a distance of -18.32 meters longitudinally and -1.26 meters laterally. Although approaching, the distance and relative velocity (7.29 m/s longitudinal, 2.09 m/s lateral) suggest this obstacle is a high risk, requiring attention but not as immediately critical as Obstacle 20084.


Risk Levels:
0: Collision - Physical contact occurred or unavoidable
1: Extreme Risk - Immediate collision likely
2: High Risk - Close to collision, needs quick action
3: Medium Risk - Manageable with proper reaction
4: Low Risk - Minimal risk, sufficient time to react
5: Negligible Risk - No significant risk
