### Safety analysis for timestep 3.4s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

**Assumptions and Clarifications:**

* Since the provided scenario lacks vehicle dimensions and precise trajectory information, accurate TTC and MDC calculations are impossible.  The analysis will be qualitative, based on relative velocities, distances, and movement descriptions. The "exact lateral alignment or unknown case" statement suggests potential lateral risks that need to be considered. Also, since adjusted distances are not provided, the raw distances will be used for this analysis.
* "Front," "Behind," "Rear-right" are interpreted as general direction indicators, not precise locations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

**- Obstacle ID: 20082**
- Distance Risk reason: Located 17.70m longitudinally and 17.70m laterally in front of the ego vehicle and moving away.  Presents no immediate risk.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Moving away from the ego vehicle longitudinally.  No TTC concern.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

**- Obstacle ID: 20084**
- Distance Risk reason:  Located -0.84m longitudinally and -0.84m laterally behind the ego vehicle and rapidly approaching. Extremely high risk of collision.
- Distance safety score: 1
- Time Risk reason: Closing rapidly on the ego vehicle.  Very short TTC indicates imminent collision risk.
- Time safety score: 1
- Overall Risk score: 1

**- Obstacle ID: 20086**
- Distance Risk reason: Located -18.32m longitudinally and -18.32m laterally to the rear-right and approaching, but at a greater distance than 20084.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: While approaching, the distance provides some buffer.  Moderate TTC.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3
