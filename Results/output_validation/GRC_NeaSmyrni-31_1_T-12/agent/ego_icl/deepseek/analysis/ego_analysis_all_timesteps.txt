Let me analyze each obstacle at the most recent timestep (3.4 seconds) and assess collision risks:

1. Obstacle 20082 (Front):
   - Adjusted distances: longitudinal 17.70m, lateral 0.00m
   - Relative velocity: longitudinal 0.36 m/s (moving away), lateral -0.13 m/s (slight left movement)
   - Motion: Moving away longitudinally, exact lateral alignment
   - TTC: Not applicable (moving away longitudinally)
   - MDC: 17.70m (longitudinal)
   - Risk: 5 (Negligible) - Moving away in both dimensions

2. Obstacle 20084 (Behind):
   - Adjusted distances: longitudinal -0.84m, lateral 0.00m
   - Relative velocity: longitudinal 5.24 m/s (approaching fast), lateral 0.19 m/s (minimal lateral movement)
   - Motion: Driving toward ego from behind, exact lateral alignment
   - TTC: 0.84m / 5.24m/s = 0.16 seconds (Extreme Risk)
   - MDC: 0.84m (longitudinal)
   - Risk: 1 (Extreme) - Very close with high closing speed

3. Obstacle 20086 (Rear-right):
   - Adjusted distances: longitudinal -18.32m, lateral -1.26m
   - Relative velocity: longitudinal 7.29 m/s (approaching), lateral 2.09 m/s (approaching from right)
   - Motion: Driving toward ego from behind and right
   - TTC longitudinal: 18.32m / 7.29m/s = 2.51s (Medium)
   - TTC lateral: 1.26m / 2.09m/s = 0.60s (High)
   - MDC: 1.26m (lateral)
   - Risk: 2 (High) - Based on lateral TTC

Trajectory Analysis:
- Obstacle 20084 shows consistent rapid approach from behind (longitudinal distance decreasing from -6.10m to -0.84m in 1.0s)
- Obstacle 20086 shows steady approach from rear-right but still has reasonable distance
- Obstacle 20082 is safely moving away

Final JSON summary:
```json
{
    "CollisionObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": null,
        "OverallRiskScore": null
    },
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "20084",
        "OverallRiskScore": "1"
    },
    "PredictedCollisionObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "20084",
        "OverallRiskScore": "0"
    }
}
```

Key findings:
- Obstacle 20084 presents extreme risk (score 1) and is predicted to collide within the next timestep if current trajectory continues
- No actual collision has occurred yet (no score 0 in current timestep)
- Other obstacles present lower risks that don't require immediate action
