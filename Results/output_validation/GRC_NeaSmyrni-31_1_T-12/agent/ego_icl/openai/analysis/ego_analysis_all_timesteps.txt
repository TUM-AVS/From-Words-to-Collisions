### Obstacle-by-Obstacle Analysis

#### Obstacle 20082
- **Direction**: Front
- **Adjusted Distances**: Longitudinal 17.70 m, Lateral 0.00 m
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal 0.36 m/s, Lateral -0.13 m/s
- **Trajectory**: Moving away
- **Analysis**:
  - **Trajectory**: Observed to be consistently moving away from the ego vehicle, with steadily increasing longitudinal distance.
  - **TTC**: Not applicable as obstacle is moving away.
  - **MDC**: Given the increasing longitudinal distance, the risk of collision is minimal.

**Final Risk**: No Risk (5)

#### Obstacle 20084
- **Direction**: Behind
- **Adjusted Distances**: Longitudinal -0.84 m, Lateral 0.00 m
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal 5.24 m/s, Lateral 0.19 m/s
- **Trajectory**: Driving toward ego vehicle
- **Analysis**:
  - **Trajectory**: The longitudinal distance is decreasing, indicating the obstacle is swiftly approaching the ego vehicle.
  - **TTC Calculation**: TTC = |-0.84 m / 5.24 m/s| ≈ 0.16 seconds
  - **MDC**: With decreasing distance and positive velocity in longitudinal direction, MDC is likely very small.
  - **Risk**: This scenario represents a high collision risk given the very low TTC.

**Final Risk**: Extreme Risk (1)

#### Obstacle 20086
- **Direction**: Rear-right
- **Adjusted Distances**: Longitudinal -18.32 m, Lateral -1.26 m
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal 7.29 m/s, Lateral 2.09 m/s
- **Trajectory**: Driving toward ego vehicle laterally from the right
- **Analysis**:
  - **Trajectory**: Longitudinal and lateral distances consistently decreasing.
  - **TTC Calculation Longitudinal**: TTC = |-18.32 m / 7.29 m/s| ≈ 2.51 seconds
  - **TTC Calculation Lateral**: TTC = |-1.26 / 2.09 m/s| ≈ 0.60 seconds
  - **MDC**: Both lateral and longitudinal distances are becoming smaller, but lateral distance is closing faster.
  - **Risk**: The situation demands attention mainly due to the lateral closing, giving a medium risk overall.

**Final Risk**: Medium Risk (3)
