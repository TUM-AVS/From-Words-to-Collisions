At t=3.6s, Ego is at (49.3216, 79.4487) with a velocity of 2.3769 m/s. Let's analyze the risk associated with each obstacle at this timestep.

* **Obstacle 20082:** Located at (40.5495, 58.989), this obstacle is far from Ego and poses no immediate threat.  Its negative acceleration suggests it is further reducing the risk of collision. Risk score: 5 (Negligible Risk)

* **Obstacle 20084:** Located at (50.8476, 83.5148), this obstacle is relatively close to Ego. While the y-coordinate difference might seem concerning, the x-coordinate difference is small, and both Ego and the obstacle appear to be moving in roughly the same direction along the lanelet.  Further calculations are needed to eliminate any longitudinal collision risk, and the obstacle's negative acceleration indicates that the situation might improve soon. Risk score: 3 (Medium Risk)

* **Obstacle 20086:** Located at (54.8368, 100.2781), this obstacle is also relatively far from Ego and does not pose an immediate threat. The obstacle appears to be ahead of Ego, and its negative acceleration reduces risk. Risk score: 4 (Low Risk).

Since no obstacle presents a collision or extreme risk, IsCollisionScenario is false.

```json
{
  "CollisionObstacles": [],
  "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null,
  "ScenarioAnalysis": {
    "IsCollisionScenario": false,
    "Reasoning": "No obstacle is on a collision course with Ego within the predicted timeframe. The closest obstacle (20084) presents a medium risk due to its proximity, but the risk is manageable given current trajectories and decelerations."
  }
