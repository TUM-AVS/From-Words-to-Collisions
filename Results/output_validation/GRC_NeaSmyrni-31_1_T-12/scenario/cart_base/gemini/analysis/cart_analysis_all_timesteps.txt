At t=3.6s, Ego (20083.0) is at (49.3216, 79.4487) in lanelet 1463.0.

Obstacle 20082.0 is at (40.5495, 58.989) and moving slower than Ego.  Given the distances and trajectories, this obstacle poses no immediate risk.

Obstacle 20084.0 is at (50.8476, 83.5148).  It's relatively close to Ego and slightly ahead, but the trajectories suggest increasing separation, making it a low risk.

Obstacle 20086.0 is at (54.8368, 100.2781) and moving faster than Ego.  While farther down the lanelet, its high speed relative to Ego warrants attention but isn't an immediate threat, thus medium risk.

Since no obstacles pose an immediate collision risk, the scenario is not a collision scenario.
