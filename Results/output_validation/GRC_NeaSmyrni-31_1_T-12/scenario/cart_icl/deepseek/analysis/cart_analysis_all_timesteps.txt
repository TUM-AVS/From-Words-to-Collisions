### Safety Analysis for the Most Recent Timestep (3.6 seconds):

#### Key Observations:
1. **Ego Vehicle**: 
   - Position: (49.3216, 79.4487)
   - Velocity: 2.3769 m/s (decelerating)
   - Lanelet: 1463.0

2. **Obstacles in Same Lanelet (1463.0)**:
   - 20076.0, 20077.0, 20078.0, 20079.0, 20080.0, 20082.0, 20084.0, 20086.0
   - All are static except 20082.0, 20084.0, 20086.0 (moving towards ego)

3. **Critical Moving Obstacles**:
   - 20082.0: Moving towards ego at 2.4918 m/s (decelerating)
   - 20084.0: Moving towards ego at 7.2707 m/s (decelerating)
   - 20086.0: Moving towards ego at 9.5693 m/s (decelerating)

#### Obstacle Analysis (Most Critical):
- **Obstacle 20086.0**:
  - Position: (54.8368, 100.2781)
  - Distance from ego: ~20.83m (longitudinal)
  - Relative velocity: ~7.19 m/s (closing speed)
  - TTC: ~2.9 seconds
  - **Overall Risk Score**: 2 (High Risk)

- **Obstacle 20084.0**:
  - Position: (50.8476, 83.5148)
  - Distance from ego: ~4.07m (longitudinal)
  - Relative velocity: ~4.89 m/s
  - TTC: ~0.83 seconds
  - **Overall Risk Score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)

- **Obstacle 20082.0**:
  - Position: (40.5495, 58.9890)
  - Distance from ego: ~20.47m (behind ego)
  - **Overall Risk Score**: 4 (Low Risk)

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. Ego is decelerating in lanelet 1463.0
2. Obstacle 20084.0 is approaching rapidly with TTC <1s
3. No direct collision at this timestep, but extreme risk due to proximity and speed
4. Other obstacles are either static or moving away
