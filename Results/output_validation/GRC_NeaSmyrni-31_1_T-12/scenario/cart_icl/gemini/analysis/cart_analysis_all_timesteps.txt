### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 20082.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is far behind and moving away from the ego vehicle.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason:  Relative velocity and acceleration indicate no risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 20084.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is ahead but at a safe distance and moving faster.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Relative velocity indicates low risk.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- Obstacle ID: 20086.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is further ahead than 20084.0 and moving faster.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Relative velocity indicates no risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5


### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
Analyzing the provided timesteps reveals that the ego vehicle is traveling in the same lanelet (1463.0) as all three obstacles. Obstacle 20082.0 is consistently behind the ego vehicle and moving slower. Obstacles 20084.0 and 20086.0 are ahead of the ego vehicle and moving faster, increasing their distance over time. Therefore, this is not a collision scenario.
