### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 20082**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Positioned ahead of the ego in the same lanelet. Moving away (position change decreasing distance slightly), but relative velocity trend suggests the ego is closing the gap.
  - **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: Relative velocity decreasing; however, ego's deceleration is higher, which allows for safe management. Consistent slow-down pattern.
  - **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 20084**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Positioned marginally ahead and laterally offset. Consistent negative acceleration reducing the potential overlap with the ego.
  - **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: Higher velocity and consistent deceleration, decreasing the overlap risk longitudinally.
  - **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 20086**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Positioned further of all obstacles but shares the same path of travel as the ego with clear trajectory separation over time.
  - **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: High velocity but consistent deceleration and significant distance creates negligible immediate risk.
  - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
The scenario appears to pose low to negligible risk levels for potential collision. Obstacle ID 20082 shows a reduction in velocity over time, and other vehicles (20084 and 20086) are well ahead with consistent deceleration, reducing the possibility of an immediate collision. No extreme or collision scenarios exist in the recent timestep.
