### Safety analysis for timestep 2.7-3.6: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

**Methodology:**

Given that explicit TTC and MDC values aren't provided, we'll estimate risk based on distance, relative velocity, and motion descriptions.  A collision is deemed to occur when the longitudinal and lateral distances simultaneously approach zero.  We lack precise dimensions of the vehicles, making accurate TTC/MDC calculation impossible. We'll focus on qualitative assessment.

**Timestep 2.7-3.5 (excluding 3.6):**

### Obstacle Analysis:

**- Obstacle ID: 20082**
- Distance Risk reason: Located in front and moving away longitudinally, large lateral distance.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Moving away from the ego vehicle.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

**- Obstacle ID: 20084**
- Distance Risk reason: Located behind and approaching rapidly longitudinally, small lateral distance suggests potential rear-end collision.
- Distance safety score: 2
- Time Risk reason: Rapidly closing longitudinally, high risk of rear-end collision within the next few seconds.
- Time safety score: 2
- Overall Risk score: 2

**- Obstacle ID: 20086**
- Distance Risk reason: Located behind and to the right, relatively large longitudinal and lateral distance.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Closing distance, but current trajectory doesn't immediately indicate collision. Lateral movement adds uncertainty. Monitoring needed.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3


**Timestep 3.6:**

### Obstacle Analysis:

**- Obstacle ID: 20082**
- Distance Risk reason: Located in front and moving away longitudinally, large lateral distance.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Moving away from the ego vehicle.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

**- Obstacle ID: 20084**
- Distance Risk reason: Collision reported at this timestep. Zero longitudinal and lateral distance.
- Distance safety score: 0
- Time Risk reason: Collision occurred.
- Time safety score: 0
- Overall Risk score: 0

**- Obstacle ID: 20086**
- Distance Risk reason: Located behind and to the right, decreasing longitudinal and lateral distance.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: Still approaching but no immediate collision indicated in this timestep.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3
