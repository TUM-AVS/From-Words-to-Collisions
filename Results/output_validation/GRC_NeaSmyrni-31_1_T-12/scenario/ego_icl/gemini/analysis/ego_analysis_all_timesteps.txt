* **Obstacle 20082 (Front):**  This obstacle has been consistently in front of the ego vehicle and moving away longitudinally across all timesteps. At the latest timestep (3.6s), the longitudinal distance is 17.75m and lateral distance is 0.00m.  The lateral alignment suggests they are in the same lane, but the increasing longitudinal distance indicates no collision risk.  The relative longitudinal velocity is a small positive 0.11 m/s, indicating the obstacle is barely moving relative to the ego vehicle, but is not approaching. Since it's moving away and at a safe distance, TTC calculation is not applicable. MDC is not a concern due to the large longitudinal separation. Risk score: 5 (No Risk).

* **Obstacle 20084 (Behind/Collision):** This obstacle has been approaching the ego vehicle from behind across all timesteps. At 3.6 seconds, both longitudinal and lateral distances are 0.00m, indicating a collision. The description explicitly states "Obstacle 20084 is in the Collision of the ego car." The relative velocity shows it was approaching at 4.89 m/s longitudinally.  TTC is 0s, MDC is 0m. Risk score: 0 (Collision).

* **Obstacle 20086 (Rear-Right):** This obstacle is approaching from behind and to the right.  At 3.6 seconds, the longitudinal distance is -16.89m and the lateral distance is -0.96m. While it is getting closer, it's still relatively far. The relative longitudinal velocity is 7.97 m/s and the lateral velocity is 2.05 m/s. Considering the distances and velocities, TTClongitudinal = 2.12s and TTC Lateral = 0.47s. MDC is approximately 1 meter. The faster closing is the lateral distance giving us a higher risk level. This would indicate a risk score of 2 based on the TTC and 3 based on MDC. We prioritize the higher risk which is 2. Risk score: 2 (High Risk).

**Collision Scenario Determination:** Yes, this is a collision scenario. Obstacle 20084 has collided with the ego vehicle.
