### Analysis of the Scenario:

**Obstacle 20082:**

- **Position and Motion:**
  - Direction: Front
  - Adjusted Distances: Longitudinal 17.75 m, Lateral 0.00 m
  - Relative Velocity: Longitudinal 0.11 m/s (away), Lateral -0.10 m/s
  - Motion Description: Obstacle is moving away longitudinally

- **Trajectory Analysis:**
  - This obstacle is consistently moving away from the ego vehicle over the recorded intervals.
  - The longitudinal distance is increasing, indicating a diverging path.

- **Risk Assessment:**
  - **Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC):** > 5.0 meters
  - **Time-to-Collision (TTC):** Not applicable since the obstacle is moving away
  
- **Overall Risk:** No Risk (5)

**Obstacle 20084:**

- **Position and Motion:**
  - Direction: Behind (now in Collision)
  - Adjusted Distances: Longitudinal ≈ 0.00 m, Lateral ≈ 0.00 m
  - Relative Velocity: Longitudinal 4.89 m/s (approaching), Lateral 0.22 m/s
  - Motion Description: Exact longitudinal and lateral alignment

- **Trajectory Analysis:**
  - This obstacle has been progressively closing the gap to the ego vehicle due to a positive approaching velocity in the longitudinal dimension.
  - In the latest timestamp, the calculated distance for both dimensions is effectively zero, indicating physical contact.

- **Risk Assessment:**
  - **Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC):** 0 meters
  - **Time-to-Collision (TTC):** 0 seconds
  
- **Overall Risk:** Collision (0)

**Obstacle 20086:**

- **Position and Motion:**
  - Direction: Rear-Right
  - Adjusted Distances: Longitudinal -16.89 m, Lateral -0.96 m
  - Relative Velocity: Longitudinal 6.97 m/s (approaching), Lateral 2.05 m/s
  - Motion Description: Obstacle is driving toward the ego car from behind and right

- **Trajectory Analysis:**
  - This obstacle is approaching the ego vehicle from a diagonal direction. 
  - While the longitudinal distance is quite significant, the lateral distance is reducing progressively.
  
- **Risk Assessment:**
  - **Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC):** With current trajectory and velocities, the risk remains at a lateral convergence, not immediate contact.
  - **Time-to-Collision (TTC):** Calculated based on lateral approaching, the TTC still suggests some buffer.

- **Overall Risk:** Low Risk (4)

### Conclusion:
This scenario presents a **collision scenario** with Obstacle 20084 due to effectively zero net distances and converging approach velocities, indicating a collision at this timestamp.
