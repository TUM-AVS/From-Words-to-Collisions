### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
    - Obstacle ID: 20082
    - Relative Direction: Front
    - Distance Risk Reason: DTClong is 17.75m, which is > 5, indicating negligible risk longitudinally. DTClat is 0.0m, meaning it's directly in front.  History shows it moving away.
    - Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 5
    - Lateral Distance Safety Score: 5
    - Overall Distance Safety Score: 5.0
    - Time Risk Reason: TTClong is inf, indicating no longitudinal collision risk. TTClat is 0.0, but given the history and that the obstacle is moving away, this doesn't represent an immediate lateral risk.
    - Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 5
    - Lateral Time Safety Score: 5
    - Overall Time Safety Score: 5.0
    - Overall Risk Score: 5

    - Obstacle ID: 20084
    - Relative Direction: Behind
    - Distance Risk Reason: DTClong is 0.0m indicating a collision at this timestep. DTClat is 0.0m, meaning the collision is directly behind. History shows the obstacle approaching continuously.
    - Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 0
    - Lateral Distance Safety Score: 5
    - Overall Distance Safety Score: 0.0
    - Time Risk Reason: TTClong is 0.0s, indicating collision. TTClat is 0.0s. History shows a decreasing TTC, leading to collision.
    - Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 0
    - Lateral Time Safety Score: 5
    - Overall Time Safety Score: 0.0
    - Overall Risk Score: 0

    - Obstacle ID: 20086
    - Relative Direction: Rear-right
    - Distance Risk Reason: DTClong is -16.89m and DTClat is -0.96m.  The negative DTClong indicates it's behind. DTClat shows some lateral separation, but the trend over the history indicates converging movement. The obstacle is approaching both longitudinally and laterally from the rear-right.
    - Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 5
    - Lateral Distance Safety Score: 2
    - Overall Distance Safety Score: 3.5
    - Time Risk Reason: TTClong is 2.42s and TTClat is 0.47s. The TTClat, being less than 0.5s, represents an extreme risk in the near future, while TTClong poses no current longitudinal risk. The historical trend indicates this is likely to lead to at least lateral contact.
    - Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 3
    - Lateral Time Safety Score: 1
    - Overall Time Safety Score: 2.0
    - Overall Risk Score: 3
