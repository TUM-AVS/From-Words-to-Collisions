Here's the collision risk analysis:

**Ego (20099.0):**  The ego vehicle is traveling in lanelet 1033. We need to analyze its relationship with other obstacles in the same or nearby lanelets.

**Obstacle 20056.0:** This obstacle is located in lanelet 600, far from the ego vehicle and poses no immediate threat.  Risk score: 5 (Negligible Risk)

**Obstacle 20089.0:** Similar to 20056, this obstacle is also in lanelet 600 and far from the ego vehicle. Risk score: 5 (Negligible Risk)

**Obstacle 20090.0:**  Also located in lanelet 600, this obstacle is far from the ego vehicle. Risk score: 5 (Negligible Risk)

**Obstacle 20096.0:** This obstacle is in lanelet 602, which appears to be separate from the ego vehicle's lanelet. While its position is relatively far from the ego vehicle, its high velocity warrants monitoring. Risk score: 4 (Low Risk)

**Obstacle 20100.0:** This obstacle is in the same lanelet (1033) as the ego vehicle and is following the ego vehicle, so its x-coordinate is larger than the ego vehicle at all timesteps. Although its velocity is higher than the ego vehicle, it has negative acceleration. From the coordinate positions, the obstacle does not show any immediate threat. Risk score: 3 (Medium Risk) â€“ requires monitoring due to the same lanelet.
