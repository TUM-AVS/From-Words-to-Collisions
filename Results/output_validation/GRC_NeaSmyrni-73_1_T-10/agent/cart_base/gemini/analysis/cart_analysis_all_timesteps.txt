Obstacle 20056: Located in a different lanelet (600) than the ego vehicle (1033), and its position remains static throughout the provided timesteps.  Poses no collision risk. Negligible Risk (5).

Obstacle 20089: Located in a different lanelet (600) than the ego vehicle (1033), and its position changes minimally.  Poses no collision risk. Negligible Risk (5).

Obstacle 20090: Located in a different lanelet (600) than the ego vehicle (1033), and its position changes minimally. Poses no collision risk. Negligible Risk (5).

Obstacle 20096: Located in a different lanelet (602) than the ego vehicle (1033). While its x-coordinate is increasing, its y-coordinate is significantly different from the ego vehicle's, making a collision unlikely. Low Risk (4).

Obstacle 20100: Located in the same lanelet (1033) as the ego vehicle. Both vehicles are moving in roughly the same direction (similar orientations), but 20100 is behind the ego vehicle and its x-coordinate is increasing faster than the ego vehicle's. This suggests it is moving faster and could potentially overtake the ego vehicle at some point in the future. The y-coordinates also suggest some lateral movement might bring them closer together.  However, within the given timeframe, there's no immediate collision risk. Medium Risk (3).
