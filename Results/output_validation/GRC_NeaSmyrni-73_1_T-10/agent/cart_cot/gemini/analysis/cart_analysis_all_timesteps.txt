Obstacle 20100 is in the same lane as the ego vehicle and is moving faster than ego with a closing velocity.  While some distance away, the continuous negative acceleration of the ego vehicle and positive acceleration of obstacle 20100 warrants attention. Obstacle 20096, despite some distance, also displays concerning behavior with high velocity.  Other obstacles are not an immediate concern.
