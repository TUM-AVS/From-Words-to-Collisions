Based on the data provided, we need to evaluate the risk each obstacle poses relative to the ego vehicle, particularly focusing on the most recent timestep (3.5 seconds). Here's the risk analysis for each obstacle:

- **Obstacle 20056.0**: It remains stationary with minimal velocity decrease and no significant change in position. It poses negligible risk to the ego vehicle.
  
- **Obstacle 20089.0**: It is nearly stationary and shares the same lanelet as the previous and other stationary obstacles. This obstacle poses no meaningful risk.

- **Obstacle 20090.0**: While it has reduced velocity over time, it shows consistent deceleration. This obstacle does not present immediate concern.

- **Obstacle 20096.0**: Despite being active, it resides in a different lanelet and demonstrates decreasing velocity, which continues to increase its distance from the ego.

- **Obstacle 20100.0**: This obstacle is in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle and exhibits significant velocity with slight deceleration. Its relative motion towards the ego, along with its same-lanelet positioning, indicates increased risk. The minimum distance and time to collision (TTC) suggest an elevated risk score. 

### Short Analysis for High-Risk Obstacle (Risk Score 2):
Obstacle 20100.0 is in a converging path with the ego vehicle in the same lanelet. While the current trajectory and velocity indicate that collision isn't imminent, urgent attention is required to avoid potential escalation.
