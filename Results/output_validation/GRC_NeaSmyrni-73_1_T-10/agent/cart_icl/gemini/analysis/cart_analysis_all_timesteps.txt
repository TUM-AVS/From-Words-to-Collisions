Obstacle 20100 is in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle and is relatively close.  At the last timestep (3.5s), obstacle 20100 is approximately 2.5m ahead of the ego vehicle and closing based on the velocity differences. This represents a possible collision risk.

Obstacle 20096 is in a different lanelet and is far from the ego vehicle, posing no immediate threat. The other obstacles are also far away and/or moving slowly and therefore don't represent an immediate risk.
