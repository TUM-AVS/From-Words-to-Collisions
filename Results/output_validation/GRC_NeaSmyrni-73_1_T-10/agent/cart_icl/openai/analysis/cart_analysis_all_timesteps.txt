To analyze the scenario with the provided data, let's focus on the most recent timestep at 3.5 seconds and evaluate the risk levels for each obstacle relative to the ego vehicle using time to collision (TTC) and minimum distance to collision (MDC). Here's a step-by-step assessment of each obstacle:

### Obstacle Evaluations:

**Obstacle 20056.0:**
- Positioned far away from the Ego, with minimal velocity and constant position over the timesteps.
- No threat or immediate danger to the Ego, as it remains in a separate lanelet and maintains a substantial distance.

**Obstacle 20089.0:**
- Very close proximity, but stationary with negligible velocity and minimal acceleration.
- Positioned laterally distant; stays in a separate lanelet.
- No immediate risk of collision.

**Obstacle 20090.0:**
- Stationary and showing deceleration. Remaining consistently lateral and longitudinal away from the Ego vehicle.
- Low risk since it's not moving towards the ego and remains in a different lanelet.

**Obstacle 20096.0:**
- Located at a considerably higher distance from the Ego, maintaining a constant trajectory with the Ego clearly not being on a collision path.
- Substantial separation and different lanelet reduce the risk score to negligible concerns.

**Obstacle 20100.0:**
- Moving with high speed within the same lanelet as the Ego. 
- However, it is positioned ahead of the Ego and does not show symptoms of rapid deceleration or reduction in distance from the Ego.
- As this obstacle is accelerating away and separated by distance, there's no immediate risk despite sharing the lane.

### Risk Summary:
- Obstacles 20056.0, 20089.0, 20090.0, and 20096.0 are assessed as negligible risk due to lack of conducive factors for a collision (distance, speed, path).
- Obstacle 20100.0 needs attention despite its current separation since it shares a lanelet with the Ego, but remains classified as low risk due to its relative speed and positioning.

### Overall JSON Output:

```json
{
    "CollisionObstacles": [],
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null,
    "HighRiskObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "20100.0",
        "OverallRiskScore": 2
    }
}
```

In this assessment, Obstacle 20100.0 is assigned a high-risk score due to its same-lanelet presence and velocity toward the Ego vehicle, although no immediate collision threat manifests, it requires monitoring for any sudden changes in trajectory or velocity.
