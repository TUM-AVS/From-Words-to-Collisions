At timestamp 3.5 seconds, the following analysis is performed for each obstacle:

**Obstacle 20056:** This obstacle is located 5.98m longitudinally and 8.74m laterally from the ego vehicle, posing a medium risk in terms of proximity. Although the relative longitudinal velocity is negative, suggesting it's moving towards the ego vehicle, the lateral distance provides a safety margin. Considering the given data, there's no immediate danger of collision, but a risk level of 3 is assigned due to its longitudinal movement.

**Obstacle 20089:** Located at 3.69m longitudinally and 15.35m laterally, this obstacle presents a similar risk profile to 20056 but with higher longitudinal proximity.  The lateral distance is still substantial, but the decreasing longitudinal distance warrants attention. Risk level 3 (Medium)

**Obstacle 20090:** This obstacle poses the most significant risk, with a longitudinal distance of only 1.29m and a lateral distance of 22.27m. Its closing longitudinal velocity indicates a high probability of collision if the trajectories are maintained.  The proximity and closing velocity call for immediate action to avoid collision and warrant a risk level 2 (High).

**Obstacle 20096:** This obstacle is relatively far, with a longitudinal distance of 16.22m and a lateral distance of -18.52m.  It poses a negligible collision risk due to the significant distance and its lateral movement away from the ego vehicle.  Risk level 5 (Negligible Risk).

**Obstacle 20100:** This obstacle is behind the ego vehicle at -1.14m and shows a relative longitudinal velocity of 7.25 m/s moving towards the ego vehicle. Although it's behind the ego vehicle, its very close proximity and high closing velocity suggest a potential for a rear-end collision. Therefore, it's classified as level 2 (High) Risk.
