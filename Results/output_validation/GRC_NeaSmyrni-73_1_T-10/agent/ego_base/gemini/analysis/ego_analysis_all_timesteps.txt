At t=3.5s:
- **Obstacle 20056:** Located front-left (5.98m longitudinal, 8.74m lateral), approaching longitudinally (-4.15 m/s) and slightly laterally (-0.24 m/s).  Risk score: 2 (High Risk) due to the close longitudinal distance and approaching motion.

- **Obstacle 20089:** Located front-left (3.69m longitudinal, 15.35m lateral), approaching longitudinally (-4.22 m/s) and almost no lateral movement (-0.05 m/s). Risk score: 1 (Extreme Risk) due to the very close longitudinal distance and approaching motion.

- **Obstacle 20090:** Located front-left (1.29m longitudinal, 22.27m lateral), approaching longitudinally (-3.80 m/s) and laterally (-1.26 m/s). Risk score: 1 (Extreme Risk) due to the extremely close longitudinal distance, despite the relatively large lateral distance.

- **Obstacle 20096:** Located front-right (16.22m longitudinal, -18.52m lateral), moving away laterally to the right (-9.69 m/s) and slightly approaching longitudinally (-1.02 m/s). Risk score: 4 (Low Risk) due to large longitudinal and lateral distances and the lateral motion away from the ego vehicle.

- **Obstacle 20100:** Located behind (-1.14m longitudinal, 0.00m lateral), approaching rapidly from behind (7.25 m/s). Risk score: 1 (Extreme Risk) due to very close longitudinal distance and high approaching speed from behind.

Risk Levels:
0: Collision - Physical contact occurred or unavoidable
1: Extreme Risk - Immediate collision likely
2: High Risk - Close to collision, needs quick action
3: Medium Risk - Manageable with proper reaction
4: Low Risk - Minimal risk, sufficient time to react
5: Negligible Risk - No significant risk
