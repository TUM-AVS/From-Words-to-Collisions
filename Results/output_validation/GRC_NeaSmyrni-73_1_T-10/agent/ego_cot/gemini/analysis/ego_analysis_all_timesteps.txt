### Safety analysis for timestep 3.5 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

Obstacle 20090 shows the highest risk at this timestep.  It is very close, moving towards the ego vehicle, and the calculated TTC suggests a likely collision if trajectories are maintained. Obstacles 20056 and 20089 also present a considerable risk as they are closing in on the ego vehicle, and prompt action might be needed to avoid a risky situation. Obstacle 20100, while close behind, is not considered an immediate threat since it is moving away from the ego vehicle longitudinally although in the last timestep, the distance is very close. Obstacle 20096 is the furthest away and moving away laterally, posing the least risk.

### Obstacle Analysis:

**- Obstacle ID: 20056**
- Distance Risk reason: At 5.98m longitudinal and lateral distance in the front-left direction indicates proximity.
- Distance safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
- Time Risk reason: Negative longitudinal velocity suggests closing distance but sufficient time to react.
- Time safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 4

**- Obstacle ID: 20089**
- Distance Risk reason:  At 3.69m longitudinal and lateral distance in the front-left direction indicates proximity.
- Distance safety score: 3 (Medium Risk)
- Time Risk reason: Negative longitudinal velocity suggests closing distance but limited time to react.
- Time safety score: 3 (Medium Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 3

**- Obstacle ID: 20090**
- Distance Risk reason: At 1.29m longitudinal and lateral distance in the front-left indicates extreme proximity.
- Distance safety score: 2 (High Risk)
- Time Risk reason: Very short TTC, high probability of collision if the motion continues.
- Time safety score: 1 (Extreme Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 1

**- Obstacle ID: 20096**
- Distance Risk reason: Large longitudinal and lateral distance (16.22m) in the front-right, moving away laterally, presents no immediate concern.
- Distance safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- Time Risk reason:  Negative longitudinal velocity indicates the distance is closing, but lateral movement makes collision unlikely.
- Time safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 5

**- Obstacle ID: 20100**
- Distance Risk reason:  At -1.14m longitudinal and lateral distance from the behind, however the negative longitudinal distance indicates the obstacle is located behind the ego vehicle.
- Distance safety score: 2 (High Risk)
- Time Risk reason: The longitudinal velocity is positive, indicates it is moving away from the ego vehicle longitudinally.
- Time safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 2
