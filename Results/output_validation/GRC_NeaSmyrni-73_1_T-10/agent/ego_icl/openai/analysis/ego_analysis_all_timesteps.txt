**Obstacle Analysis at 3.5 seconds:**

1. **Obstacle 20056**:
   - **Position**: Front-left of ego vehicle
   - **Adjusted Distances**: Longitudinal = 5.98 m, Lateral = 8.74 m
   - **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal = -4.15 m/s, Lateral = -0.24 m/s 

   **Trajectory Analysis**:
   - The longitudinal distance has been consistently reducing over time, indicating the obstacle is moving toward the ego.
   - Lateral movement towards the ego is minimal and reducing slower.

   **TTC and MDC Calculations**:
   - Longitudinal TTC = 5.98 / 4.15 = 1.44 seconds
   - Lateral distance is significant; not a concern given movement patterns
   - MDC based mostly on longitudinal trajectory: approximately 5.98 m

   **Risk Assessment**: Medium Risk (3)
   - Justifiable by a decreasing longitudinal gap and trajectory alignments.

2. **Obstacle 20089**:
   - **Position**: Front-left of ego vehicle
   - **Adjusted Distances**: Longitudinal = 3.69 m, Lateral = 15.35 m
   - **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal = -4.22 m/s, Lateral = -0.05 m/s 

   **Trajectory Analysis**:
   - The longitudinal distance shows rapid reduction.
   - The obstacle's lateral distance is stable with only minor adjustments over the analyzed period.

   **TTC and MDC Calculations**:
   - Longitudinal TTC = 3.69 / 4.22 = 0.87 seconds
   - MDC primarily impacted by longitudinal motion: approximately 3.69 m

   **Risk Assessment**: High Risk (2)
   - The critical factor is the reducing longitudinal distance and converging trajectory, placing it in a high-risk category.

3. **Obstacle 20090**:
   - **Position**: Front-left of ego vehicle
   - **Adjusted Distances**: Longitudinal = 1.29 m, Lateral = 22.27 m
   - **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal = -3.80 m/s, Lateral = -1.26 m/s 

   **Trajectory Analysis**:
   - Significant reduction in longitudinal distance; however, the rate is slower than preceding cases. 
   - Lateral position remains non-impactful due to the considerable distance.

   **TTC and MDC Calculations**:
   - Longitudinal TTC = 1.29 / 3.80 = 0.34 seconds
   - MDC seemingly less than 0.5 m imminently unless action taken.

   **Risk Assessment**: Extreme Risk (1)
   - Rapidly closing longitudinal distance with a high chance of immediate collision justifies extreme caution.

4. **Obstacle 20096**:
   - **Position**: Front-right of the ego vehicle
   - **Adjusted Distances**: Longitudinal = 16.22 m, Lateral = -18.52 m
   - **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal = -1.02 m/s, Lateral = -9.69 m/s 

   **Trajectory Analysis**:
   - Position changes suggest movement further away laterally.
   - Negligible approach on the longitudinal axis.

   **TTC and MDC Calculations**:
   - Obstacle moving away laterally and longitudinally ensures no immediate concern.

   **Risk Assessment**: Negligible Risk (5)
   - Unlikely to interfere with ego trajectory given current and projected paths.

5. **Obstacle 20100**:
   - **Position**: Behind the ego vehicle
   - **Adjusted Distances**: Longitudinal = -1.14 m, Lateral = 0.00 m
   - **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal = 7.25 m/s, Lateral = -0.01 m/s 

   **Trajectory Analysis**:
   - Shortening gap with increasing velocity most concerning among listed details.

   **TTC and MDC Calculations**:
   - Approaching rapidly from behind with very short TTC.
   - Longitudinal TTC = 1.14 / 7.25 = 0.16 seconds

   **Risk Assessment**: Collision (0)
   - Imminent and unavoidable without immediate intervention.
