At t=3.7s, Ego is at (21.57, 3.62) in lanelet 1033. Let's analyze the latest positions of the obstacles:

- **Obstacle 20056:**  Located far away in lanelet 600, posing no immediate risk. Risk score 5.
- **Obstacle 20089:** Located far away in lanelet 600, posing no immediate risk. Risk score 5.
- **Obstacle 20090:** Located far away in lanelet 600, posing no immediate risk. Risk score 5.
- **Obstacle 20096:** Located in lanelet 602, laterally separated from Ego.  Risk score 5.
- **Obstacle 20100:** At (23.44, -0.16) in lanelet 1033.  This is close to the Ego's position.  Examining the trajectory shows both Ego and this obstacle are moving in the same general direction, but previous positions indicate they were converging. The small lateral difference suggests a potential collision.  The position at time 3.6 makes collision very probable. Although there may be a slight horizontal offset, the approaching trajectories, velocities, and nearness in position warrant the highest caution. Risk score 1.
- **Obstacle 20104:** At (34.23, -22.10) in lanelet 1033, far behind Ego, posing no immediate risk. Risk score 5.

Obstacle 20100 poses an extreme risk due to its proximity and converging trajectory with the Ego vehicle.
