At t=3.7s, Ego (20099.0) is in lanelet 1033.0 at (21.5746, 3.6215).  We analyze potential collisions with other obstacles at this timestep.

* **Obstacle 20100.0:** Located in the same lanelet (1033.0) as Ego at (23.4359, -0.1635).  While the x-positions suggest 20100.0 is ahead of Ego, the y-positions indicate they are separated laterally. Examining previous timesteps reveals 20100.0 is moving faster than Ego and its y-coordinate is increasing (moving closer to Ego's y-coordinate).  Given the relatively small lateral separation and the speed difference, this presents an *Extreme Risk* (score 1).

* **Obstacle 20104.0:** Also in lanelet 1033.0 at (34.2288, -22.1016). This obstacle is significantly further down the lanelet than Ego and also has a significant lateral separation.  While its high speed is a consideration, the current distances and trajectories suggest a *Low Risk* (score 4) at this timestep. The others are clearly separated and pose low risk for the current timestep.

        "Reasoning": "Obstacle 20100.0 poses an extreme risk due to its close proximity to Ego within the same lanelet, its higher speed, and converging trajectories. While no collision is imminent at this instant, the risk is very high given the observed movement patterns."
