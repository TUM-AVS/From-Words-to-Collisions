### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:

- Obstacle ID: 20056.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is far from the ego vehicle and located in a different lanelet.  Its position has remained static over the past several timesteps.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: The obstacle's velocity is very low and decreasing.  No risk from a time perspective.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 20089.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is far from the ego vehicle and located in a different lanelet. Its position has barely changed over the past several timesteps.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: The obstacle's velocity is very low and decreasing.  No risk from a time perspective.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 20090.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is far from the ego vehicle and located in a different lanelet.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: The obstacle's velocity is moderate but poses no risk given its location and the ego vehicle's trajectory.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 20096.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is located in a different lanelet and relatively far from the ego vehicle.  While it is moving faster than the ego vehicle, the lateral separation mitigates the risk.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Although the obstacle has a high velocity, the different lanelet and lateral distance suggest a low risk over the short term.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- Obstacle ID: 20100.0
- Distance Risk reason: This obstacle is in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle and is getting closer over time. While not immediately dangerous, the decreasing distance warrants attention.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason:  The obstacle is moving faster than the ego vehicle, and both are decelerating. The time risk is medium as the closing velocity needs to be carefully monitored.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3

- Obstacle ID: 20104.0
- Distance Risk reason: This obstacle is in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle, but appears significantly behind it based on the provided data.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: The obstacle's velocity is higher than the ego vehicle's. However, given the current distance and the fact both are decelerating, the risk is relatively low.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4


### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. **Most critical obstacles:** Obstacle 20100.0 is the most critical as it is in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle and getting closer. Obstacle 20104.0 also shares the same lanelet but is further behind the ego vehicle, posing less immediate risk.

2. **Trajectory analysis:** Over the 10 timesteps, 20100.0 consistently moves faster than the ego vehicle while both decelerate. 20104.0 appears only in the last two timesteps and is also moving faster than the ego but further behind. Other obstacles are in different lanelets and present no immediate concern.

3. **Relative positions, velocities, and accelerations:** The decreasing distance between the ego vehicle and 20100.0, coupled with the velocity difference, indicates a potential risk. Though both decelerate, the closing rate remains a factor to monitor.

4. **Collision determination:** No collision has occurred within the provided timeframe. There's no immediate collision imminent, but the situation with 20100.0 requires further observation as it presents a developing risk.

5. **Reasoning:** Based on current trajectories and velocities, a collision is not certain but possible if the current trends continue.  The ego vehicle or obstacle 20100.0 would likely need to take further actions (like stronger deceleration or lane change) to mitigate future risk.

### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
  "CollisionObstacles": null,
  "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null,
  "ScenarioAnalysis": {
    "IsCollisionScenario": false,
    "Reasoning": "While obstacle 20100 poses a medium risk due to its proximity, relative velocity, and shared lanelet with the ego vehicle, no collision has occurred within the provided 10 timesteps.  The situation requires monitoring, but a collision is not imminent based on the current data. Other obstacles are in different lanelets or at safe distances and do not present an immediate threat."
