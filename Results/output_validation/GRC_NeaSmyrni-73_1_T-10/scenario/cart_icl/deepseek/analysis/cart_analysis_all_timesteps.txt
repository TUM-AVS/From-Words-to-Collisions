### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. No obstacles are in the same lanelet (1033.0) as the ego vehicle.
2. All obstacles are either stationary or moving away from the ego's trajectory.
3. The closest obstacle (20100.0) is moving parallel to the ego with sufficient distance.
4. No obstacles show a trajectory that would intersect with the ego's path in the near future.
5. The ego is decelerating, further reducing any potential risk.
