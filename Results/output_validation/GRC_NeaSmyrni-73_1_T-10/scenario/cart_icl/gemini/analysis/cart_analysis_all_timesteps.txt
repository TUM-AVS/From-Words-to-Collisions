- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Relatively high velocity but moving away from ego in a different lanelet.  No risk based on provided timesteps.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 20100.0
- Distance Risk reason: Same lanelet as ego but positioned behind and moving slower. Distance increasing over time.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Lower velocity than ego, and both are decelerating.  No time-based risk observed.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 20104.0
- Distance Risk reason: Same lanelet but far behind ego. Distance increasing over time.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Higher velocity than ego, but distance increasing substantially over time. No time-based risk observed.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5


### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
No obstacles are on a collision course with the ego vehicle. Obstacles in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle (20100.0 and 20104.0) are significantly behind and exhibit no immediate risk. All other obstacles are in different lanelets and maintain safe distances. Therefore, this is not a collision scenario.


### Summary in JSON Format:
