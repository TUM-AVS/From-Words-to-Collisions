### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep:
Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

1. **Obstacle ID: 20056**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: This obstacle remains stationary at its position (8.0322, 7.6943) across multiple timesteps; it is far from the ego vehicle's trajectory.
   - **Distance safety score**: 5
   - **Time Risk reason**: Given the negligible velocity and consistent position, there is no significant threat of collision in the near future.
   - **Time safety score**: 5
   - **Overall Risk score**: 5

2. **Obstacle ID: 20089**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle has not moved significantly and remains distant from the ego vehicle. It is not on a collision course based on current trajectories.
   - **Distance safety score**: 5
   - **Time Risk reason**: Very low velocity over time indicates no imminent threat.
   - **Time safety score**: 5
   - **Overall Risk score**: 5

3. **Obstacle ID: 20090**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Initially stationary and slowly moving away from the ego vehicle. Positioned farther and away from the ego vehicle's path.
   - **Distance safety score**: 5
   - **Time Risk reason**: Current trajectory and speed suggest it is moving away from the ego vehicle.
   - **Time safety score**: 5
   - **Overall Risk score**: 5

4. **Obstacle ID: 20096**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Positioned consistently further away from the ego vehicle at (31.606, 32.1352), maintaining a stable trajectory in a different lanelet.
   - **Distance safety score**: 5
   - **Time Risk reason**: Greater speed but a stable distance from ego vehicle indicates low collision likelihood.
   - **Time safety score**: 5
   - **Overall Risk score**: 5

5. **Obstacle ID: 20100**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Approaching the ego vehicle significantly over time. Positioned close to the ego vehicle at (23.4359, -0.1635) in the same lanelet.
   - **Distance safety score**: 2
   - **Time Risk reason**: High speed in the same lanelet and closing distance raises significant time-related collision risk.
   - **Time safety score**: 2
   - **Overall Risk score**: 2

6. **Obstacle ID: 20104**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Significantly far at approximately (34.2288, -22.1016) and maintaining a steady path without closing rapidly on the ego vehicle.
   - **Distance safety score**: 4
   - **Time Risk reason**: Despite the relatively high speed, the distance and direction indicate minimal immediate threat.
   - **Time safety score**: 4
   - **Overall Risk score**: 4

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
- Analyze the timesteps for ego vehicle and obstacles movement.
- Identify potential collision based on spatial proximity and relative velocity.
- Determine risk by analyzing if any obstacle's position and trajectory threaten the ego vehicle to indicate collision.

### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
    "CollisionObstacles": null,
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null,
    "ScenarioAnalysis": {
        "IsCollisionScenario": false,
        "Reasoning": "No obstacles in the immediate trajectory with collision risk score of 0 or extreme risk score of 1; moderate risk for one obstacle (20100) but controllable."
    }
}
```

This structured risk analysis implies no immediate collision or extreme risk scenario at the current timestep, although obstacle 20100 requires attention due to its increasing proximity to the ego vehicle.
