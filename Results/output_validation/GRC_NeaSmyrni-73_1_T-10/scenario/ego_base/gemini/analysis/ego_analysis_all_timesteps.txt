At t=3.7s, Obstacle 20100 is in direct collision with the ego vehicle, as indicated by a longitudinal distance of 0.0m.  Other obstacles (20056, 20089, 20090) are in the front-left and approaching but not posing an immediate collision risk in this timestep. Obstacle 20096 is moving away laterally to the right. Obstacle 20104 is approaching from behind but is still relatively far.

**Risk Levels and Definitions:**
<Collision (Score: 0)>: Actual collision has occurred or is unavoidable within the next timestep.
<Extreme Risk (Score: 1)>: Immediate collision or very high likelihood of impact. Urgent action is required.
<High Risk (Score: 2)>: Close to collision or highly probable collision path. Needs prompt attention and quick manoeuvring.
<Medium Risk (Score: 3)>: Moderate collision risk but manageable with timely reactions and proper strategies.
<Low Risk (Score: 4)>: Minimal collision risk. The situation is controllable with sufficient time to react.
<Negligible Risk (Score: 5)>: No significant collision risk. Obstacles are either moving away or far enough not to interfere.
