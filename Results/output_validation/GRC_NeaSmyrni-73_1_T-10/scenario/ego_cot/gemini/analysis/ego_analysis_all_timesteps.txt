### Safety analysis for timestep 2.8-3.7: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

**Methodology:**

Given the data, precise TTC calculations are difficult due to varying accelerations.  We will estimate TTC using `TTC â‰ˆ Distance / Relative Velocity`.  This simplification assumes constant velocity, which isn't entirely accurate but provides a reasonable approximation for risk assessment.  MDC will be approximated by the minimum observed distance within the provided timeframe.  We'll analyze each obstacle individually and consider both longitudinal and lateral movement for a comprehensive risk assessment.  A combined risk assessment considering the most dangerous predicted point in the trajectory will provide the overall score.


### Obstacle Analysis:

**- Obstacle ID: 20056**
- Distance Risk reason: Initially at a safe distance (9.37m longitudinal, 9.37m lateral) but closing on the ego vehicle throughout the scenario.  By 3.6 seconds, the distances are 5.55m in both directions, indicating a potential collision path.
- Distance safety score: 3 (Medium Risk)
- Time Risk reason: Based on the simplified TTC estimation, the longitudinal risk increases over time. Lateral movement also presents a concern. The combination suggests a medium to high risk.
- Time safety score: 3 (Medium Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 3 (Medium Risk)

**- Obstacle ID: 20089**
- Distance Risk reason:  This obstacle poses a significant risk, starting at 7.07m and closing to 2.88m by 3.7 seconds.  The continuous approach indicates a high likelihood of collision if the trajectories remain unchanged.
- Distance safety score: 2 (High Risk)
- Time Risk reason: Similar to the distance analysis, the decreasing longitudinal and lateral distances coupled with the closing velocities indicate a high risk of collision.
- Time safety score: 2 (High Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 2 (High Risk)

**- Obstacle ID: 20090**
- Distance Risk reason: Extremely high risk. This obstacle starts at 4.57m and closes to a mere 0.49m by 3.7 seconds.  A collision is highly likely without immediate intervention.
- Distance safety score: 1 (Extreme Risk)
- Time Risk reason:  The consistently decreasing distance and closing velocities indicate imminent collision risk.
- Time safety score: 1 (Extreme Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 1 (Extreme Risk)

**- Obstacle ID: 20096**
- Distance Risk reason:  This obstacle starts at 17.5m and maintains a relatively large distance while moving laterally away from the ego vehicle, presenting minimal risk.
- Distance safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- Time Risk reason:  The lateral movement away from the ego vehicle reduces collision risk, despite the slight longitudinal closing.
- Time safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 4 (Low Risk)

**- Obstacle ID: 20100**
- Distance Risk reason:  This obstacle starts behind the ego vehicle and closes the distance throughout the scenario, resulting in a collision at 3.7 seconds.
- Distance safety score: 0 (Collision)
- Time Risk reason: The continuous approach from behind and collision at 3.7s indicate extremely high risk.
- Time safety score: 0 (Collision)
- Overall Risk score: 0 (Collision)

**- Obstacle ID: 20104**
- Distance Risk reason: This obstacle is initially far behind (-25.03m) but approaches the ego vehicle.  While it doesn't collide within the provided timeframe, it should be monitored.
- Distance safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
- Time Risk reason:  The closing velocity suggests a potential future risk, though not immediate.
- Time safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 4 (Low Risk)
