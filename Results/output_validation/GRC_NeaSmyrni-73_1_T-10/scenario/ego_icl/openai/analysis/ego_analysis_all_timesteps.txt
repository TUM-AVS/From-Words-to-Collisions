Let's analyze the most recent timestep at 3.7 seconds for each obstacle to determine risk levels:

### Obstacle-by-Obstacle Analysis

1. **Obstacle 20056 (Front-left)**
   - **Adjusted Distances:** Longitudinal = 5.15 m, Lateral = 8.72 m
   - **Relative Velocities:** Longitudinal = -3.91 m/s, Lateral = -0.20 m/s
   - **Trajectory:** Approaching from front-left, converging longitudinally and slightly laterally.
   - **TTC (Longitudinal):** \( \text{TTC} = \frac{5.15}{3.91} \approx 1.32 \text{ seconds} \)
   - **MDC Consideration:** MDC primarily influenced by longitudinal distance, approximately 5.15 m (as it's decreasing).
   - **Risk Assessment:** Medium Risk (3); distances still within a reasonable safety margin, but continued attention is required.

2. **Obstacle 20089 (Front-left)**
   - **Adjusted Distances:** Longitudinal = 2.88 m, Lateral = 15.33 m
   - **Relative Velocities:** Longitudinal = -3.98 m/s, Lateral = -0.00 m/s
   - **Trajectory:** Approaching directly from front-left, short longitudinal distance is concerning.
   - **TTC (Longitudinal):** \( \text{TTC} = \frac{2.88}{3.98} \approx 0.72 \text{ seconds} \)
   - **MDC Consideration:** MDC is approximately 2.88 m longitudinally.
   - **Risk Assessment:** High Risk (2); potential for collision if no intervention occurs, due to short time-to-collision.

3. **Obstacle 20090 (Front-left)**
   - **Adjusted Distances:** Longitudinal = 0.49 m, Lateral = 22.26 m
   - **Relative Velocities:** Longitudinal = -3.60 m/s, Lateral = -1.08 m/s
   - **Trajectory:** Very close longitudinally, moving toward the ego on both axes.
   - **TTC (Longitudinal):** \( \text{TTC} = \frac{0.49}{3.60} \approx 0.14 \text{ seconds} \)
   - **MDC Consideration:** Minimum approaching distance is 0.49 m longitudinally.
   - **Risk Assessment:** Extreme Risk (1); very short time-to-collision and minimum approach distance, immediate action needed.

4. **Obstacle 20096 (Front-right)**
   - **Adjusted Distances:** Longitudinal = 15.88 m, Lateral = -20.27 m
   - **Relative Velocities:** Longitudinal = -0.85 m/s, Lateral = -9.50 m/s
   - **Trajectory:** Moving laterally away to the right.
   - **TTC (Lateral):** Constant lateral movement away without significant concern.
   - **MDC Consideration:** No immediate collision path.
   - **Risk Assessment:** No Risk (5); lateral reduced threats.

5. **Obstacle 20100 (Behind)**
   - **Adjusted Distances:** Longitudinal = 0.00 m, Lateral = 0.00 m
   - **Relative Velocities:** Longitudinal = 7.37 m/s, Lateral = -0.03 m/s
   - **Trajectory:** Reported collision; exact overlap both laterally and longitudinally.
   - **MDC Consideration:** Immediate vicinity suggests collision status.
   - **Risk Assessment:** Collision (0); absolute priority for evasive actions.

6. **Obstacle 20104 (Behind)**
   - **Adjusted Distances:** Longitudinal = -24.16 m, Lateral = 0.00 m
   - **Relative Velocities:** Longitudinal = 8.91 m/s, Lateral = -0.03 m/s
   - **Trajectory:** Approaching from behind but still far off.
   - **TTC (Longitudinal):** Longitudinal distance divided by closing velocity roughly equates to sufficient safety time.
   - **Risk Assessment:** Low Risk (4); reasonable time until potential collision.

### Conclusion:
The presence of Obstacle 20100 is identified as an actual collision situation, with Obstacle 20090 posing an extreme risk due to its fast-approaching trajectory, reinforcing the scenario's critical status.
