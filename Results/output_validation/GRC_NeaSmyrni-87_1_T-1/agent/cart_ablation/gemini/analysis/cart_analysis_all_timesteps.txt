Here's the analysis of the provided scenario:

**Obstacle 20039.0:**

This obstacle appears stationary throughout the provided timesteps.  The ego vehicle is approaching the obstacle, and the distance between them is decreasing. At t=0.0, the distance is approximately 7.1 meters. At t=0.1, the distance shrinks to about 6.1 meters, and at t=0.2, it reduces further to roughly 5.3 meters. Considering the ego vehicle's speed and deceleration, and the fact the obstacle isn't moving, a collision is highly probable within the next few timesteps if the ego vehicle does not take corrective action. Therefore, I classify this as an *Extreme Risk (1)* at t=0.2.
