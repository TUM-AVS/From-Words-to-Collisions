The ego vehicle is moving forward while decelerating. The obstacle (ID 20039.0) is stationary.  The ego vehicle's x-coordinate is approaching the obstacle's x-coordinate, indicating a potential collision risk.

At t=0.0s, the distance between ego and obstacle is approximately 8.9 meters.
At t=0.1s, the distance reduces to approximately 6.1 meters.
At t=0.2s, the distance further reduces to approximately 5.2 meters.

Given the ego vehicle's speed and deceleration, and the obstacle's stationary position, a collision is highly likely if this trend continues.  Since we don't have future timesteps, we can't definitively say a collision *will* happen within the next second or two, but the risk is clearly high. Thus, a risk score of 2 (High Risk) is appropriate.
