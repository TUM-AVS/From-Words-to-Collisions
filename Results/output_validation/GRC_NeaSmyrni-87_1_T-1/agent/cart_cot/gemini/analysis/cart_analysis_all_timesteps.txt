At t=0.2s, the ego vehicle is at (-59.6645, 30.0197) with a velocity of 7.1085 m/s and decelerating at -4.9073 m/sÂ². Obstacle 20039.0 is stationary at (-64.7112, 31.5258).

The distance between the ego and the obstacle at t=0.2s is approximately 6.28 meters.  The ego vehicle is moving towards the obstacle, but decelerating. While the provided data shows the ego approaching the obstacle over the first few timesteps, more data is needed to determine the precise TTC and MDC.  Without complete trajectory information, an accurate risk assessment is impossible. The static nature of the obstacle and initial trajectory of the ego, however, suggest a potential future collision unless the ego continues to decelerate or changes lanes. A High Risk is assigned based on current available information but acknowledging there isn't enough data available to make a precise estimation, calling for urgent action from the ego vehicle to avoid potential collision.
