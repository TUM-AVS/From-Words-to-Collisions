In analyzing the given scenario, we have the Ego vehicle and one stationary obstacle. Using the information available:

1. **Current Dynamics**:
   - **Ego Vehicle**:
     - At 0.0 seconds: Position = (-58.0228, 29.5296), Speed = 8.6208 m/s, Acceleration = -2.4056 m/s².
     - At 0.2 seconds: Position = (-59.6645, 30.0197), Speed = 7.1085 m/s, Acceleration = -4.9073 m/s².
     - The Ego is slowing down, as indicated by the negative acceleration and decreasing velocity values.
   - **Obstacle**:
     - At 0.2 seconds: Position = (-64.7112, 31.5258), Speed = 0 m/s.
     - Stationary, no change in position.

2. **Relative Position and Motion**:
   - The changes in the Ego's position indicate it is moving along a path similar to the lanelet orientation.
   - The obstacle is stationary in the same lanelet as the Ego.

3. **TTC and MDC Calculation**:
   - **TTC** (Time to Collision): Cannot be determined as the obstacle is stationary; potential collision depends on Ego's deceleration.
   - **MDC** (Minimum Distance to Collision): Needs consideration since the Ego is in a deceleration phase and slightly deviating, but proximity can still potentially lead to a collision.

4. **Risk Evaluation**:
   - At time 0.2 seconds, the Ego approaches a stationary obstacle in the same lanelet.
   - Due to Ego's sharp deceleration and proximity to a stationary object in its path, urgent attention is needed.

5. **Overall Risk Score**:
   - The stationary nature of the obstacle and the Ego's location in the same lanelet suggest a high risk due to potential close distance and need for urgent braking. Given these dynamics, a Higher Risk score seems fitting.
