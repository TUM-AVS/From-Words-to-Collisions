At t=0.2s, the ego vehicle is at (-59.6645, 30.0197) with a velocity of 7.1085 m/s and acceleration of -4.9073 m/sÂ². Obstacle 20039 is stationary at (-64.7112, 31.5258).

The distance between the ego and the obstacle is approximately sqrt((-64.7112 + 59.6645)^2 + (31.5258 - 30.0197)^2) = 5.27m. The ego is decelerating, but still moving towards the obstacle. Since the obstacle is stationary, a collision is possible if the ego continues on its current trajectory and deceleration rate.  A more precise risk assessment would require predicting the ego vehicle's future trajectory based on its deceleration and the obstacle's assumed stationary state.  Given the limited information and the ego's deceleration, the risk is currently high but not imminent.
