### Analysis:

**Scenario Summary:**

- **Ego Vehicle (ID: 20042)**:
  - **Timestep 0.0s**: Position (-58.0228, 29.5296), Orientation 2.8514, Velocity 8.6208 m/s, Acceleration -2.4056 m/s².
  - **Timestep 0.1s**: Position (-58.8664, 29.7815), Velocity 7.9897 m/s, Acceleration -3.8429 m/s².
  - **Timestep 0.2s**: Position (-59.6645, 30.0197), Velocity 7.1085 m/s, Acceleration -4.9073 m/s². 

- **Obstacle (ID: 20039)**:
  - **Timestep 0.1s and 0.2s**: Position remains constant (-64.7112, 31.5258), Orientation 2.8515, Velocity 0.0 m/s (stationary).

**Trajectory Analysis**:
- Over 0.2 seconds, the ego vehicle is decelerating and moving along a roughly straight trajectory (orientation change is minimal). The obstacle is stationary within the same lanelet (117.0), suggesting it's directly ahead or adjacent within the lane. 

**Distance and Risk Assessment**:
- **Distance between Ego and Obstacle at 0.2s**:
  - Longitudinal distance: \|Ego_x - Obstacle_x\| = |-59.6645 - (-64.7112)| = 5.0467 meters (assuming simple linear distance along x-axis)
  - Lateral distance: \|Ego_y - Obstacle_y\| = \|30.0197 - 31.5258\| = 1.5061 meters (assuming linear distance along y-axis)
  
- The distance between the ego vehicle and the stationary obstacle is closing due to ego's forward motion.

**Risk Calculation**:
- **TTC (Time to Collision)** cannot be directly calculated with the given data as the obstacle is stationary, and we prioritize current positions.
- **MDC (Minimum Distance to Collision)** concerns suggest a close proximity.

**Risk Evaluation**:
- Given the current motion and acceleration trends, the ego vehicle is dynamically adjusting speed, and although the obstacle is stationary, the distances are minimal.
- Based on the close proximity and same lanelet occupancy, urgent action is necessary to avoid a collision.

}
```

**Explanation**:
- **Extreme Risk (1)**: The obstacle 20039 is stationary, located very close to the ego vehicle's trajectory, and the ego vehicle's decelerating pattern suggests it might not stop in time without urgent action. Therefore, an extreme risk level is assigned due to the high urgency in intervening.
