At t=0.2 seconds, Obstacle 20039 is located 0.76 meters longitudinally in front of the ego vehicle and is moving towards the ego vehicle at -7.11 m/s.  The MDC is less than 1.0 meter, indicating a high risk. The closing velocity suggests a very short TTC, likely less than 1 second.  Both these factors indicate a high risk of collision.
