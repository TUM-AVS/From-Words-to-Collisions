At t=0.2 seconds, Obstacle 20039 is located 0.76m in front of the ego vehicle and directly in its path (lateral distance 0.0m).  The closing velocity is -7.11 m/s, meaning the obstacle is approaching the ego vehicle rapidly. Additionally, the negative relative acceleration of -4.70 m/sÂ² indicates that the closing speed is increasing. These factors combined signify an extremely high risk of imminent collision.

Risk Levels:
0: Collision - Physical contact occurred or unavoidable
1: Extreme Risk - Immediate collision likely
2: High Risk - Close to collision, needs quick action
3: Medium Risk - Manageable with proper reaction
4: Low Risk - Minimal risk, sufficient time to react
5: Negligible Risk - No significant risk
