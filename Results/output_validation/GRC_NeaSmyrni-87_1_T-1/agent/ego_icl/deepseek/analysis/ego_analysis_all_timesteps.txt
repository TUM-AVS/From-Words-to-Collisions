### Obstacle Analysis: 20039

#### Trajectory Analysis:
- **At 0.1 seconds**:
  - Longitudinal distance: 1.59 m
  - Lateral distance: 0.00 m (exact alignment)
  - Relative velocity (longitudinal): -7.99 m/s (closing)
  - Relative acceleration (longitudinal): -3.68 m/s² (decelerating)
  
- **At 0.2 seconds**:
  - Longitudinal distance: 0.76 m (decreased from 1.59 m)
  - Lateral distance: 0.00 m (still aligned)
  - Relative velocity (longitudinal): -7.11 m/s (still closing, but slightly slower)
  - Relative acceleration (longitudinal): -4.70 m/s² (decelerating more)

#### Key Observations:
1. **Longitudinal Movement**:
   - The obstacle is directly in front of the ego vehicle (lateral distance = 0.00 m).
   - The longitudinal distance is decreasing rapidly (from 1.59 m to 0.76 m in 0.1 seconds).
   - The relative velocity is negative (closing) and high (-7.11 m/s at the latest timestep).
   - The relative acceleration is also negative (-4.70 m/s²), meaning the closing speed is increasing.

2. **Lateral Movement**:
   - The lateral distance remains 0.00 m, indicating the obstacle is perfectly aligned with the ego vehicle's path.
   - No lateral relative velocity or acceleration (0.00 m/s and 0.00 m/s²), so no lateral movement.

#### Risk Assessment:
1. **Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC)**:
   - The lateral distance is 0.00 m (aligned), so the MDC is determined by the longitudinal distance.
   - At the latest timestep, the longitudinal distance is 0.76 m.
   - This falls in the range **0.5 < MDC ≤ 1.0 meters**, which corresponds to **High Risk (2)**.

2. **Time-to-Collision (TTC)**:
   - TTC = distance / |relative velocity| = 0.76 m / 7.11 m/s ≈ 0.107 seconds.
   - This falls in the range **TTC ≤ 0.5 seconds**, which corresponds to **Extreme Risk (1)**.

3. **Overall Risk**:
   - The TTC indicates Extreme Risk (1), while the MDC indicates High Risk (2).
   - Per the instructions, we prioritize the higher risk (lower score), so the overall risk is **Extreme Risk (1)**.

#### Prediction:
- The obstacle is closing rapidly (TTC ≈ 0.107 seconds) and is very close (0.76 m).
- Given the high deceleration (-4.70 m/s²), the collision may be imminent in the next timestep unless evasive action is taken.
