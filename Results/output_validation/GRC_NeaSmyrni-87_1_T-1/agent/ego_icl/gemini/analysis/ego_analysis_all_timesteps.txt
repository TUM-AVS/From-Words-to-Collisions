Obstacle 20039 is located in front of the ego vehicle and is approaching rapidly.  At t=0.1s, the longitudinal distance is 1.59m and closing at -7.99 m/s.  By t=0.2s, the distance has shrunk to 0.76m with a velocity of -7.11 m/s.  The lateral distance is consistently 0.00m, indicating the obstacle is in the same lane.  

Given the rapid closing velocity and minimal distance, a collision is highly likely in the next few frames.  The obstacle's continued approach directly in front of the ego vehicle presents a significant risk.

TTC Calculation at t=0.2s:
TTC = Distance / Relative Velocity = 0.76m / 7.11m/s â‰ˆ 0.11 seconds.

MDC at t=0.2s: 0.76m.

The TTC of 0.11 seconds indicates an *Extreme Risk (1)*. The MDC of 0.76m also indicates a *High Risk (2)*. Since we prioritize the higher risk, the overall risk score is 1.
