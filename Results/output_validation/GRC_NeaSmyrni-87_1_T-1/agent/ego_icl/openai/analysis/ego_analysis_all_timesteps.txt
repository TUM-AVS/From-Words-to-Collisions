### Obstacle-by-Obstacle Analysis

#### Analyzing Obstacle 20039:
- **Most Recent Timestep**: At 0.2 seconds
  - **Adjusted Distances**: Assume same as real as adjusted distances are not specified.
  - **Relative Position**: Front
  - **Adjusted Longitudinal Distance**: 0.76 meters
  - **Adjusted Lateral Distance**: 0.00 meters (same lane alignment)
  - **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal -7.11 m/s (approaching)
  - **Motion Description**: Obstacle is driving toward the ego car longitudinally with exact lateral alignment.

#### Calculations:
1. **Time-to-Collision (TTC) Calculation**:
   - Longitudinal TTC = Distance / |Relative Velocity| = 0.76 / 7.11 â‰ˆ 0.107 seconds

2. **Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC)**:
   - MDC = Longitudinal distance as lateral is zero indicating same lane: 0.76 meters

#### Risk Assessment:
- **TTC = 0.107 seconds**, which implies Extreme Risk (1)
- **MDC = 0.76 meters**, which implies High Risk (2)
  
Because the TTC implies a higher risk level than the MDC, we prioritize this assessment:
- **Result**: Extreme Risk (1)

#### Conclusion:
Obstacle 20039 presents an Extreme Risk for collision due to a very short TTC and a small MDC, confirming the high urgency indicated by fast approaching velocity and alignment.
