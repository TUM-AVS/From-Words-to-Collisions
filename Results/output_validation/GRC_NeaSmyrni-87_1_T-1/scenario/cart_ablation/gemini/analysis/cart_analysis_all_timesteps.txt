At t=0.4s, the ego vehicle is at (-61.0446, 30.4316) and the obstacle (ID 20039.0) is stationary at (-64.7112, 31.5258).  The ego vehicle is approaching the obstacle, but there is still lateral and longitudinal separation.

Calculating distance between ego and obstacle at t=0.4s:
```
sqrt((-61.0446 - -64.7112)^2 + (30.4316 - 31.5258)^2) = sqrt(3.6666^2 + (-1.0942)^2) â‰ˆ 3.83 meters.
```

The ego vehicle's velocity is decreasing, suggesting braking.  However, at the current speed of 5.8321 m/s (approximately 21 kph), the ego vehicle will cover the remaining distance to the obstacle in less than a second. Given the ego vehicle's deceleration, a collision is not imminent at t=0.4 seconds, but the risk is high, warranting immediate action. Therefore, I assign a risk score of 2 (High Risk) to obstacle 20039.0.
