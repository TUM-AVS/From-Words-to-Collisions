At t=0.4s, the ego vehicle is at (-61.0446, 30.4316) and the obstacle is stationary at (-64.7112, 31.5258).  The ego vehicle's velocity is decreasing, but it is still moving towards the obstacle.  The x-distance between the two is approximately 3.67 meters, and the y-distance is about 1.1 meters.  Given the ego vehicle's current velocity and deceleration, a collision in the next few timesteps appears likely.  Therefore, obstacle 20039.0 poses an extreme risk.
