### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 20039.0
- Distance Risk reason: At the most recent timestep (0.4 seconds), the obstacle is located at (-64.7112, 31.5258) while the ego vehicle is at (-61.0446, 30.4316). This translates to a distance of approximately 3.8 meters.  While the obstacle remains stationary and the ego vehicle is decelerating, the ego vehicle's x-coordinate is still approaching the obstacle's x-coordinate over the observed time steps. The lateral distance (y-coordinate difference) is relatively small as well.  Although the rate of approach is decreasing, the proximity and continued approach warrant a medium risk assessment.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: The ego vehicle is decelerating, but its x-coordinate is still closing in on the stationary obstacle's x-coordinate.  While the deceleration reduces the likelihood of an immediate collision, the continuing approach over several timesteps suggests that without further deceleration or a change in trajectory, a collision is still possible.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. **Identify the most critical obstacles:** Obstacle 20039.0 is the most critical as it's in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle and relatively close.
2. **Analyze their trajectories over all 10 timesteps:** The obstacle remains stationary throughout the scenario. The ego vehicle is moving towards the obstacle while decelerating.
3. **Evaluate relative positions, velocities and accelerations:** The ego vehicle's x-position is approaching the obstacle's x-position, while its y-position is relatively close to the obstacle's. The ego vehicle is decelerating.
4. **Determine if any collision has occurred or is imminent:**  No collision has occurred yet. While the deceleration reduces the risk, the continued approach suggests a collision is still possible if the ego vehicle doesn't decelerate further or alter its trajectory.
5. **Explain your reasoning for your conclusion:** The consistent approach of the ego vehicle towards the stationary obstacle over multiple timesteps, despite deceleration, indicates a medium risk of collision. While the decreasing velocity suggests the situation is improving, the current trajectory and proximity are still concerning.
