### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep (0.4 seconds):

### Obstacle Analysis:
1. **Obstacle ID: 20039.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Static obstacle in the same lanelet (117.0) as ego. Distance is decreasing as ego approaches (~3.67m at 0.4s).
   - **Distance safety score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: Ego is decelerating but still closing distance. TTC is low (~0.63s).
   - **Time safety score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)

2. **Obstacle ID: 20044.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Far from ego (~56.17m) and moving away (different lanelet).
   - **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: Moving away with deceleration.
   - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)

3. **Obstacle ID: 20045.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Far from ego (~70.56m) and in a different lanelet.
   - **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: Nearly stationary.
   - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)

4. **Obstacle ID: 20047.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Far from ego (~77.33m) and in a different lanelet.
   - **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: Stationary.
   - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)

5. **Obstacle ID: 20048.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Far from ego (~80.26m) and in a different lanelet.
   - **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: Stationary.
   - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)

6. **Obstacle ID: 20050.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Far from ego (~16.74m) and moving perpendicular to ego's path.
   - **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: High speed but not on a collision course.
   - **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low Risk)

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. Ego is decelerating but approaching static obstacle 20039.0 in the same lanelet.
2. Distance to 20039.0 is closing rapidly (~3.67m at 0.4s) with low TTC (~0.63s).
3. Other obstacles are either far away or not on a collision path.
4. No actual collision has occurred yet, but extreme risk of collision with 20039.0 is imminent.
