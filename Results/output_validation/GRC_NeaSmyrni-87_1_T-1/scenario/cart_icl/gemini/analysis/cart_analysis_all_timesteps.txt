### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 20039.0
- Distance Risk reason: The obstacle is stationary in the ego vehicle's lane. At the last timestep, the lateral distance is approximately 1.5m and the longitudinal distance is approximately 3.7m, indicating proximity.  While the ego vehicle is decelerating, the continued presence of the stationary obstacle in its path represents a significant risk.
- Distance safety score: 2
- Time Risk reason: The ego vehicle is decelerating, but its current velocity and proximity to the stationary obstacle suggest a likely collision if the deceleration is not sufficient.
- Time safety score: 2
- Overall Risk score: 2

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. **Obstacle in Path:** A stationary obstacle (20039.0) is directly in the ego vehicle's lane.
2. **Decreasing Distance:** The distance between the ego vehicle and the obstacle is decreasing over the timesteps.
3. **Deceleration:** While the ego vehicle is decelerating, it's unclear if this deceleration is sufficient to avoid collision given the current velocity and proximity.
4. **High Risk:**  The combination of decreasing distance and uncertain deceleration leads to a high risk assessment. This isn't a definite collision yet, but there's a strong possibility if the ego vehicle doesn't decelerate more aggressively.
