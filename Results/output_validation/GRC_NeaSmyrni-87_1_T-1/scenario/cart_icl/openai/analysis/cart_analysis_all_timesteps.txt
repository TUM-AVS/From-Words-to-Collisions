### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep:
Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 20039.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is stationary and located approximately 4.75 meters away from the ego vehicle in the same lanelet 117.0. Given the relative positions at each timestep, the ego vehicle is closing in on the obstacle, reducing the distance over time.
- **Distance safety score**: 2 (High risk due to decreasing proximity and shared lanelet)
- **Time Risk reason**: The velocity of the ego vehicle is gradually decreasing, which helps manage the risk. However, as the obstacle is stationary, the relative velocity is equivalent to the velocity of the ego and therefore the TTC is short due to proximity.
- **Time safety score**: 3 (Medium risk due to the trend in decreasing velocity and ability to adjust further to avoid collision)
- **Overall Risk score**: 2 (Given the high likelihood of collision without adjustments, it remains a high-risk scenario)

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. The ego vehicle is in the same lanelet as a stationary obstacle, and the distance is decreasing rapidly.
2. The relative position shows the ego vehicle's trajectory directly approaches the static obstacle.
3. Although the ego vehicle is decelerating, the proximity suggests an urgent need for more aggressive maneuvers to avoid collision.
4. Evaluation indicates a high overall risk with potential for collision unless intervention occurs.
