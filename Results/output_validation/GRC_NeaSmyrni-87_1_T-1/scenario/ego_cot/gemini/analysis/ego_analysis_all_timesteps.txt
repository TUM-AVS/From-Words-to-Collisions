### Safety analysis for timestep 0.4 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 20039
- Distance Risk reason: At t=0.4s, the obstacle is reported to be in a "Collision" state with the ego vehicle, with both longitudinal and lateral distances at 0.0m. This clearly signifies a collision.
- Distance safety score: 0
- Time Risk reason: The data leading up to the collision (t=0.1s, t=0.2s, t=0.3s) shows a consistently decreasing longitudinal distance and a relative longitudinal velocity indicating the obstacle moving towards the ego vehicle. This confirms the inevitability of the collision within the given timeframe.  At t=0.4s, the collision has occurred, so TTC is effectively 0.
- Time safety score: 0
- Overall Risk score: 0
