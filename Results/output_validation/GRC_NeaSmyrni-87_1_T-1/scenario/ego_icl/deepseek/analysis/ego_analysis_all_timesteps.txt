### Obstacle-by-Obstacle Analysis

#### Obstacle 20039 (Most Recent Timestep: 0.4s)
- **Position**: Collision with ego car (longitudinal = 0.00m, lateral = 0.00m)
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal = -5.83 m/s (approaching), Lateral = -0.00 m/s (aligned)
- **Relative Acceleration**: Longitudinal = -3.64 m/s² (decelerating), Lateral = 1.09 m/s² (minor lateral drift)
- **Motion Description**: Exact longitudinal and lateral alignment (collision occurring).

#### Trajectory Analysis (Across Timesteps)
- **0.1s**: Longitudinal distance = 1.59m, closing at -7.99 m/s
- **0.2s**: Longitudinal distance = 0.76m, closing at -7.11 m/s
- **0.3s**: Longitudinal distance = 0.00m, closing at -6.54 m/s (collision point)
- **0.4s**: Collision confirmed (distance = 0.00m in both dimensions, still closing at -5.83 m/s)

#### TTC and MDC Calculations
- **TTC**: At 0.3s, distance = 0.00m → TTC = 0s (collision occurring).
- **MDC**: At 0.3s, distance = 0.00m → MDC = 0m (collision occurring).
- **Risk Score**: 0 (Collision).

### Conclusion
- The obstacle is in direct collision with the ego vehicle at the most recent timestep (0.4s), confirmed by zero distance in both dimensions and ongoing closing velocity.
- This is a **collision scenario**.
