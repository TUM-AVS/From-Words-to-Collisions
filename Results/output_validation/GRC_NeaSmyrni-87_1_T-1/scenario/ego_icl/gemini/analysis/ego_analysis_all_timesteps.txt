Obstacle Analysis:

Obstacle 20039:

Trajectory Analysis: The obstacle consistently approaches the ego vehicle longitudinally across all timesteps, with lateral distance remaining at 0.00m, indicating alignment in the same lane. The longitudinal distance rapidly decreases from 1.59m to 0.76m and finally to 0.00m at the last timestep (0.3 seconds). This, combined with a negative relative longitudinal velocity (obstacle moving towards ego), signifies a collision. At 0.4 seconds, the scenario is explicitly labeled as a collision.

TTC Calculation (0.3s): At 0.3s, the longitudinal distance is 0.00m and the relative velocity is -6.54 m/s. TTC is calculated as distance / relative_velocity, since the values converge. With distance = 0, TTC = 0 seconds. Note that the relative velocity at this moment does not influence the calculation since the distance has gone down to zero. 

MDC Calculation (0.3s):  Given the scenario description, MDC is assessed primarily using the longitudinal distance, which is 0.00m.

Risk Assessment:

At 0.3 seconds:
- MDC = 0.00m indicates a Collision Risk (0).
- TTC = 0.0 seconds indicates a Collision Risk (0).

At 0.4 seconds:
The system explicitly labels this as a collision.

Collision Scenario Determination:

Yes, this is a collision scenario. Obstacle 20039 collides with the ego vehicle at 0.3 seconds based on MDC, TTC, and the explicit label at 0.4 seconds.
