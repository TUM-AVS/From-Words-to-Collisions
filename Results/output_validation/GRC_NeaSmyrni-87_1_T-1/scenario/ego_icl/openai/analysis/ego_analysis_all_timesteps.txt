### Obstacle-by-Obstacle Analysis

#### Obstacle 20039:
**Trajectory Analysis Across Timesteps:**
- **0.1s:** Obstacle is 1.59 m in front with a closing velocity of -7.99 m/s.
- **0.2s:** Obstacle is 0.76 m in front with a closing velocity of -7.11 m/s.
- **0.3s:** Obstacle is at 0.00 m (same point as ego, both longitudinally and laterally), indicating exact alignment.
- **0.4s:** Obstacle is effectively on top of or colliding with the ego vehicle. Exact longitudinal and lateral distance is 0.00 m, indicating collision.

**Most Recent Timestep (0.4s) Analysis:**
- **Adjusted Distances:** Longitudinal = 0.00 m, Lateral = 0.00 m
- **Relative Velocity:** Longitudinal = -5.83 m/s, Lateral = 0.00 m/s
- **Relative Acceleration:** Longitudinal = -3.64 m/s², Lateral = 1.09 m/s²

**TTC and MDC Calculations:**
- **TTC (Longitudinal):** Given the closing velocity and adjusted longitudinal distance, TTC should have been calculated as Distance / |Relative Velocity|, but as the distance is 0.00 m, collision has already occurred.
- **MDC:** The adjusted minimum distance is 0.00 m. Given the position, MDC confirms an actual collision is occurring at the most recent timestep.

**Risk Score:**
- Based on the longitudinal and lateral alignment at 0.00 m and the fact that the obstacle's trajectory already shows they are colliding, this is a collision scenario. The risk score is 0.

**Justification of Risk Level:**
- The obstacle is in exact longitudinal and lateral alignment with the ego vehicle, and both dimensions show a distance of 0.00 meters, confirming physical contact with a high converging rate. This concurrence at the most recent timestep indicates that a collision is indeed taking place.

### Conclusion: Collision Scenario Detected
- The risk score for Obstacle 20039 is determined to be 0 due to the confirmed collision.
