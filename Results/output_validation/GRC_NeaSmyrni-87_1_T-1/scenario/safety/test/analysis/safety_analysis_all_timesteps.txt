    ### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: (DUMMY ANALYSIS - No API call)
    
    This is a placeholder file. In the actual script, the context would be sent to an LLM API 
    for analysis, but in this test version, we've skipped the API call to avoid requiring API keys.
    
    The context file has been successfully generated and can be used as input to the LLM 
    if you want to manually run the analysis.
    
    ### Summary in JSON Format:
    {
        "CollisionObstacle": null,
        "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null
    }
