Here's the collision risk analysis:

**Obstacle 20043:** This obstacle appears at 4.4 seconds and is relatively far from the ego vehicle, posing no immediate threat. Risk score: 5 (Negligible Risk)

**Obstacle 20045:**  This obstacle is stationary and remains at a safe distance from the ego vehicle throughout the scenario. Risk score: 5 (Negligible Risk)

**Obstacle 20048:** This obstacle is moving slowly and its velocity is decreasing over time. It is located in the same lane as the ego vehicle but maintains a safe following distance. At 4.5 seconds, its velocity becomes 0, and it is not a risk. Risk score: 4 (Low Risk)

**Obstacle 20051:** This obstacle is initially moving at a high speed and decelerating. It is located behind the ego vehicle but getting closer over time.  While not an immediate collision risk at the end of the provided timeframe, its rapid speed and proximity warrant attention. Risk score: 3 (Medium Risk initially, transitioning to potentially High Risk if the trend continues beyond the given data). This obstacle requires further monitoring as future timestamps could reveal an elevated risk if its trajectory intersects with the ego vehicle's. Consider this a candidate for `PredictedExtremeRiskObstacle` based on the observed movement pattern.

**Obstacle 20052:** This obstacle, like 20051, is moving quickly and decelerating behind the ego vehicle. While not an immediate collision risk, its trajectory and high speed relative to the ego vehicle should be monitored carefully.  The distance between the ego vehicle and this obstacle remains large enough to classify it as Medium risk.Risk score: 3 (Medium Risk).
