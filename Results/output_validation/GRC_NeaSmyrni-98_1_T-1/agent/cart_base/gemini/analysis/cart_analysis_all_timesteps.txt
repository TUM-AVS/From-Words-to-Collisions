Here's the analysis of the scenario and the resulting JSON:

**Analysis:**

* **Obstacle 20043.0:** This obstacle appears at t=4.4s and is relatively far from the ego vehicle, posing no immediate risk.  Risk Score: 5 (Negligible Risk)

* **Obstacle 20045.0:** This obstacle is stationary and far from the ego vehicle's path, presenting no risk. Risk Score: 5 (Negligible Risk)

* **Obstacle 20048.0:** This obstacle is in the same lane as the ego vehicle and initially moving slowly. However, its velocity decreases over the subsequent timesteps and it comes to a complete stop, remaining far enough from the ego vehicle's trajectory to avoid collision.  Risk Score: 5 (Negligible Risk).

* **Obstacle 20051.0:** This obstacle is initially behind the ego vehicle but traveling significantly faster.  While it's decelerating, its trajectory suggests it could approach the ego vehicle closely in the near future, requiring monitoring. However, within the given timeframe, a collision is not imminent. Risk Score: 3 (Medium Risk)

* **Obstacle 20052.0:**  This obstacle is the furthest behind the ego vehicle and also travelling the fastest.  Like obstacle 20051, it is decelerating, but its high speed and proximity to the ego vehicle's lane raise concern.  It is likely to approach the ego vehicle quickly but not immediately, warranting attention. Risk Score: 3 (Medium Risk)
