Obstacle 20051 shows a decreasing velocity but is still moving at a considerable speed towards the ego vehicle.  Obstacle 20052 is also moving quickly and relatively close to the ego vehicle. The other obstacles appear stationary or slow-moving and present lower risk.  A more detailed analysis with TTC and MDC would provide more precise risk scores, but based on the provided data, obstacle 20051 and 20052 pose the highest risk.
