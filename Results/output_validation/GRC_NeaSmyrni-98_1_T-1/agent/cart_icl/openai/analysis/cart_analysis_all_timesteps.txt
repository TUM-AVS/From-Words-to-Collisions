Based on the latest timestep information at 4.5 seconds:

1. **Position and Velocity Analysis:**
   - **Obstacle 20043:** Static position, approximately 28 meters ahead of the ego in the same lanelet, but it doesn't pose an immediate threat given it is well ahead.
   - **Obstacle 20045:** Static position, approximately 22 meters ahead and to the left of the ego, indicating it's in a different lane or significantly laterally offset.
   - **Obstacle 20048:** Very slow movement nearly at a stop, about 16 meters ahead in the same lane, with negligible velocity. While it requires monitoring, it's not an immediate threat.
   - **Obstacle 20051:** Rapidly decelerating, about 4 meters ahead. Given its high deceleration and previous velocities, the gap is narrowing but just enough to react timely.
   - **Obstacle 20052:** This obstacle is about 18 meters ahead, continuing to decelerate. Though it's closing in, it still provides reaction time, resulting in less immediate risk than others.

2. **Risk Assessment:**
   - **Obstacle 20051** is of the most concern due to its significant deceleration and proximity to the ego vehicle. The distance is reducing noticeably, with a high risk of collision if trends continue.
   - **Obstacle 20052** is following a similar high-risk pattern but remains further ahead, allowing slightly more time for maneuvers.
   - Other obstacles present less immediate risk due to either being stationary or much further ahead, decreasing their risk relative to the ego vehicle.

3. **TTC (Time to Collision) and MDC (Minimum Distance to Collision):**
   - **Obstacle 20051:** With its deceleration and proximity, the TTC is critically low. Precise TTC can be calculated as the obstacle's distance over the relative speed difference, but it approaches the actionable threshold quickly.
   - **Obstacle 20048:** Though nearly stopped, it's distanced sufficiently, causing no immediate concerns.
   - **Obstacle 20052:** A higher risk than static or slower objects due to speed and deceleration but allows some reaction buffer compared to 20051.

```

**Explanation:** 
- The primary challenge stems from the nearly inevitable interaction with Obstacle 20051, marked as extreme due to trends towards diminishing TTC.
- Obstacle 20052 also has notable risk based on deceleration patterns and relative closeness in lane positioning, recorded as high risk.
