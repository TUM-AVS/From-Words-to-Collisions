### Safety analysis for timestep 4.5 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

It's crucial to note that the provided scenario lacks crucial information for accurate TTC and MDC calculation.  We don't have vehicle dimensions to adjust the distances, and the lateral distances being equal to the longitudinal distances is highly unusual in a real-world scenario, suggesting potentially flawed data.  The analysis below is based on the available data, but its reliability is limited by these missing and potentially inaccurate values.  Furthermore, the "exact lateral alignment or unknown case" motion description is ambiguous and hinders precise risk assessment.

### Obstacle Analysis:

**- Obstacle ID: 20043**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is far ahead and to the left of the ego vehicle (25.22m both longitudinally and laterally).
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason:  Cannot accurately calculate TTC without reliable relative velocity and proper longitudinal/lateral distinction. Assuming the current velocity and direction are maintained, a collision is unlikely in the near future.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

**- Obstacle ID: 20045**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is far ahead of the ego vehicle (18.32m both longitudinally and laterally).
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Cannot accurately calculate TTC without reliable relative velocity and proper longitudinal/lateral distinction. Assuming the current velocity and direction are maintained, a collision is unlikely in the near future.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

**- Obstacle ID: 20048**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is ahead of the ego vehicle (11.37m both longitudinally and laterally).
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Cannot accurately calculate TTC without reliable relative velocity and proper longitudinal/lateral distinction.  The closing velocity suggests some risk, but the unusual data makes precise assessment impossible.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

**- Obstacle ID: 20051**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is extremely close behind the ego vehicle (0.43m both longitudinally and laterally).
- Distance safety score: 1
- Time Risk reason: Cannot accurately calculate TTC, but the close proximity and closing velocity indicate a very high risk of imminent collision.
- Time safety score: 1
- Overall Risk score: 1

**- Obstacle ID: 20052**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is behind the ego vehicle (15.41m both longitudinally and laterally).
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Although the obstacle is behind and approaching, the distance provides a reasonable buffer.  The unclear lateral movement and unusual data make accurate TTC calculation impossible.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4
