Let me analyze each obstacle at the most recent timestep (4.5 seconds) and assess collision risks:

Obstacle 20043 (Front-left):
- Longitudinal distance: 25.22m (closing at -1.15m/s)
- Lateral distance: 0.40m (stable)
- TTC longitudinal: 25.22/1.15 ≈ 21.93s (No Risk)
- MDC: Lateral distance is stable at 0.40m (Extreme Risk for lateral)
- Overall: Primary risk is lateral proximity (Extreme Risk)

Obstacle 20045 (Front):
- Longitudinal distance: 18.32m (closing at -1.15m/s)
- Lateral distance: 0.00m (stable)
- TTC: 18.32/1.15 ≈ 15.93s (No Risk)
- MDC: Lateral alignment but stable (No Risk)
- Overall: No significant risk

Obstacle 20048 (Front):
- Longitudinal distance: 11.37m (closing at -1.15m/s)
- Lateral distance: 0.00m (stable)
- TTC: 11.37/1.15 ≈ 9.89s (No Risk)
- MDC: Lateral alignment but stable (No Risk)
- Overall: No significant risk

Obstacle 20051 (Behind):
- Longitudinal distance: -0.43m (approaching at 3.79m/s)
- Lateral distance: 0.00m (stable)
- TTC: 0.43/3.79 ≈ 0.11s (Extreme Risk)
- MDC: Already overlapping longitudinally (Collision Risk)
- Overall: Collision occurring (distance < 0m)

Obstacle 20052 (Behind):
- Longitudinal distance: -15.41m (approaching at 6.42m/s)
- Lateral distance: 0.00m (stable)
- TTC: 15.41/6.42 ≈ 2.40s (Medium Risk)
- MDC: Lateral alignment but stable (No Risk)
- Overall: Medium Risk

Trajectory Analysis:
- Obstacle 20051 shows consistent rapid approach from behind with negative distance at 4.5s
- All other obstacles either have safe distances or stable lateral positions
- Obstacle 20043 has concerning lateral proximity but no closing motion

Final Risk Assessment:
- Obstacle 20051 is currently colliding (distance < 0m)
- Obstacle 20043 presents Extreme Risk due to lateral proximity
- No other obstacles show immediate collision risk
