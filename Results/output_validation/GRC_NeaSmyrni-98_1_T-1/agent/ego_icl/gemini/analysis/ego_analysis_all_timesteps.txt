At t=4.5s:

* **Obstacle 20043 (Front-Left):**

    * Trajectory: This obstacle appears at t=4.4s and is relatively far from the ego vehicle.  It maintains a lateral distance of 0.4m.
    * Longitudinal distance: 25.22m, Relative longitudinal velocity: -1.15 m/s.  TTC_longitudinal = 25.22 / 1.15 ≈ 21.93s
    * Lateral distance: 0.40m, Relative lateral velocity: 0.00 m/s. Lateral movement is negligible.
    * MDC ≈ 0.40m
    * Risk Assessment: Although the MDC is small, the obstacle's constant lateral positioning and significant longitudinal distance suggest it poses minimal risk. It appears to be in an adjacent lane moving forward, similar to the ego. There is no indication of its lateral distance decreasing from previous timesteps.
    * Risk Score: 4 (Low risk due to small lateral distance and uncertainty about future lateral movement. However, given the forward relative velocity, there is a slight possibility the obstacle might cut in front)

* **Obstacle 20045 (Front):**

    * Trajectory: Consistently in front and slightly approaching longitudinally over multiple timesteps.  Lateral distance remains at 0.00m.
    * Longitudinal distance: 18.32m, Relative longitudinal velocity: -1.15 m/s. TTC_longitudinal = 18.32 / 1.15 ≈ 15.93s
    * Lateral distance: 0.00m, Relative lateral velocity: 0.00 m/s.
    * MDC ≈ 0.00m  (In same lane)
    * Risk Assessment: Although laterally aligned, the longitudinal distance and velocity suggest low risk.
    * Risk Score: 5 (Negligible risk - moving slowly in the same lane but far ahead)


* **Obstacle 20048 (Front):**

    * Trajectory: Consistently in front and slightly approaching longitudinally over multiple timesteps. Lateral distance remains at 0.00m.
    * Longitudinal distance: 11.37m, Relative longitudinal velocity: -1.15 m/s. TTC_longitudinal = 11.37 / 1.15 ≈ 9.89s
    * Lateral distance: 0.00m, Relative lateral velocity: 0.00 m/s.
    * MDC ≈ 0.00m (In same lane)
    * Risk Assessment: Similar to 20045, although closer. Still negligible risk given relative dynamics.
    * Risk Score: 5 (Negligible risk - moving slowly in the same lane, but far ahead)

* **Obstacle 20051 (Behind):**
    * Trajectory: Approaching rapidly from behind over multiple timesteps. Lateral distance remains at 0.00m.
    * Longitudinal distance: -0.43m, Relative longitudinal velocity: 3.79 m/s.  TTC_longitudinal = 0.43 / 3.79 ≈ 0.11s
    * Lateral distance: 0.00 m, Relative lateral velocity: -0.00 m/s.
    * MDC ≈ 0.00m (In same lane)
    * Risk Assessment: Extremely high risk due to very short distance and rapid approach.
    * Risk Score: 1 (Extreme risk - imminent collision)


* **Obstacle 20052 (Behind):**
    * Trajectory: Approaching from behind over multiple timesteps, but not as rapidly as 20051. Lateral distance remains 0.00m.
    * Longitudinal distance: -15.41m, Relative longitudinal velocity: 6.42 m/s. TTC_longitudinal = 15.41 / 6.42 ≈ 2.40s
    * Lateral distance: 0.00m, Relative lateral velocity: 0.37 m/s.
    * MDC ≈ 0.00m (In same lane)
    * Risk Assessment: High risk as this vehicle is approaching quickly from behind, though not as immediately as 20051.
    * Risk Score: 3 (Medium risk due to same-lane alignment, relatively high closing velocity, and moderate distance)
