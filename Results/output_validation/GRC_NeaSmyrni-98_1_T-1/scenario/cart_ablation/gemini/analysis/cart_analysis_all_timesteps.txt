At t=4.7s, Ego's position is (-14.7124, -40.4646) and its velocity is 1.1379. Let's analyze the closest obstacles:

* **Obstacle 20051:** Position (-16.4258, -44.3199), velocity 4.5037. This obstacle is behind the ego vehicle and moving faster.  The y-coordinate difference is significant, and continues to grow over the observed timesteps, suggesting the trajectories may converge but likely not collide in the very near future. This calls for continued monitoring, but doesn't present an immediate risk. Risk score: 3 (Medium Risk).

* **Obstacle 20052:** Position (-21.9967, -57.6722), velocity 7.1165. This obstacle is significantly behind and to the left of the ego vehicle and moving faster. However, similar to Obstacle 20051, the y-coordinate difference is substantial, indicating the trajectories likely will not converge to result in an immediate collision. Risk score: 4 (Low Risk).

* **Obstacle 20048:** Position (-8.6778, -26.0235), velocity 0. This obstacle is far ahead of the ego vehicle and stationary. Risk score: 5 (Negligible Risk).

* **Obstacle 20045:** Position (-6.4865, -19.396), velocity 0. This obstacle is even further ahead of the ego vehicle and stationary. Risk score: 5 (Negligible Risk).

* **Obstacle 20043:** Position (-4.5913, -12.6843), velocity 0. This obstacle is the furthest ahead of the ego vehicle and stationary. Risk score: 5 (Negligible Risk).
