At t=4.7s, Ego is at (-14.7124, -40.4646) with a velocity of 1.1379 m/s.  Let's analyze the obstacles:

* **20043.0:**  Static, far from Ego, no risk.
* **20045.0:** Static, far from Ego, no risk.
* **20048.0:** Static, far from Ego, no risk.
* **20051.0:** At (-16.4258, -44.3199), moving at 4.5037 m/s.  While the Y-coordinate suggests 20051.0 is behind Ego, the X-coordinate shows it's close in the lateral direction. Given the velocities, there's a potential for a lane change collision, putting this in the High-Risk category (2), but not an immediate/extreme risk.
* **20052.0:** At (-21.9967, -57.6722), moving at 7.1165 m/s.  This obstacle is significantly behind and to the left of Ego, posing no immediate risk.

Since no obstacle presents an immediate collision risk (score 0 or 1), the overall scenario is not a collision scenario.

{
    "CollisionObstacles": [],
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null,
    "ScenarioAnalysis": {
        "IsCollisionScenario": false,
        "Reasoning": "No obstacle poses an immediate collision risk at t=4.7s. Obstacle 20051.0 is classified as High Risk due to its lateral proximity and differing velocity, posing a potential lane change collision risk."
    }
