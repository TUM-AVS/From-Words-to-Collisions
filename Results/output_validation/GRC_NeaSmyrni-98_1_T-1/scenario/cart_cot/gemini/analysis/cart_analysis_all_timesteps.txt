### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 20043.0
- Distance Risk reason: This obstacle is far from the ego vehicle and poses no immediate threat.  Its static position over the observed time confirms its lack of risk.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: The obstacle is stationary, eliminating any time-related risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5
- Obstacle ID: 20045.0
- Distance Risk reason: This obstacle is moderately far from the ego vehicle. While it's closer than 20043.0, its static nature throughout the observed period suggests minimal risk.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: The obstacle is stationary, posing no dynamic risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 4
- Obstacle ID: 20048.0
- Distance Risk reason: This obstacle is relatively close to the ego vehicle and needs careful monitoring. It's consistently closer than 20045.0 and almost stationary in later timesteps.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: While initially moving, it slows down significantly in later timesteps, reducing the risk of collision.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 3
- Obstacle ID: 20051.0
- Distance Risk reason:  This obstacle is behind the ego vehicle and moving faster. The distance is closing over the observed period and requires attention. The obstacle's negative acceleration contributes to the risk assessment.
- Distance safety score: 2
- Time Risk reason: While the distance is decreasing, it remains sufficiently far and decelerating meaning a collision is not immediately likely.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 2
- Obstacle ID: 20052.0
- Distance Risk reason: This obstacle is furthest behind the ego vehicle, but moving the fastest. While the current distance suggests low risk, its high speed warrants monitoring. Its consistent negative acceleration influences the risk assessment.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: Although moving quickly, it's decelerating and its trajectory suggests it's not directly on a collision course in the immediate future.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 3


### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. **Most critical obstacles:** Obstacles 20051.0 and 20052.0 are the most critical as they are behind the ego vehicle and moving faster, posing a potential rear-end collision risk if deceleration patterns change. Obstacle 20048.0 also requires monitoring due to proximity, but its near-stationary state reduces the immediate risk.

2. **Trajectory analysis:** Over the 10 timesteps, 20051.0 and 20052.0 consistently move faster than the ego vehicle.  20048.0 progressively slows down, almost to a halt. 20043.0 and 20045.0 remain static.

3. **Relative positions, velocities, and accelerations:** The ego vehicle maintains a relatively constant velocity and orientation.  20051.0 and 20052.0 have higher velocities than the ego vehicle, but their negative acceleration lessens the immediate danger.

4. **Collision determination:** No collision has occurred or is imminent within the observed timeframe.

5. **Reasoning:** Though 20051.0 and 20052.0 are closing in, they are decelerating while maintaining safe distances and orientations in the same lanelet.  The deceleration patterns suggest the cars are likely adapting to maintain safe distances.  Obstacle 20048.0 gets slower and slower over time, reducing its risk. The other obstacles are stationary, presenting no danger.


### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
  "CollisionObstacles": [],
  "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null,
  "ScenarioAnalysis": {
    "IsCollisionScenario": false,
    "Reasoning": "No collisions are detected or predicted in the observed timeframe. While some obstacles are moving faster than the ego vehicle from behind, their negative acceleration suggests they are adjusting their speed, maintaining a safe distance for now.  All other obstacles are either stationary or slowing significantly, not posing immediate risks."
