#### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. **Collision Check**: No direct collision at current timestep, but obstacles 20045.0 and 20048.0 are extremely close to ego's path in the same lanelet.
2. **Trajectory Analysis**: Ego is decelerating (-0.0405) towards static obstacles 20045.0 and 20048.0.
3. **Risk Assessment**: Immediate action required to avoid collision with 20045.0 and 20048.0.
