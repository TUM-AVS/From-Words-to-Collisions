### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 20043.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is far from the ego vehicle and poses no immediate threat.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Obstacle is stationary.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 20045.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is far from the ego vehicle and poses no immediate threat.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Obstacle is stationary.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 20048.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is relatively far from the ego vehicle, and the distance has been slightly increasing over the last few timesteps.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Obstacle is almost stationary and decelerating.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- Obstacle ID: 20051.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is behind the ego vehicle but closing the distance rapidly over the past few timesteps.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason:  High relative velocity and although decelerating, still poses a potential risk.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3

- Obstacle ID: 20052.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is significantly behind the ego vehicle.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: While the obstacle has a high velocity, it's decelerating and far behind the ego vehicle.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4


### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
No obstacles have a risk score of 0, indicating no immediate collisions. No obstacles have a risk score of 1, signifying no extreme risk. While obstacle 20051 is getting closer,  it is still assessed as medium risk due to the current separation distance and decelerating speed. Therefore, this is not considered a collision scenario.


### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
  "CollisionObstacles": [],
  "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null,
  "ScenarioAnalysis": {
    "IsCollisionScenario": false,
    "Reasoning": "No obstacle has a risk score of 0 or 1. The closest obstacle (20051) is assessed as medium risk (score 3) due to its decreasing velocity and the existing separation distance."
  }
}
