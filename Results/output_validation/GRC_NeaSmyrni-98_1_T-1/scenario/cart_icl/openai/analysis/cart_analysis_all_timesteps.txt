### Obstacle Analysis:

#### **Obstacle ID: 20043**
- **Distance Risk reason**: Obstacle has been stationary at a considerable distance from the ego over numerous timesteps, positions remain unchanged, situated far outside immediate path of the ego.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: With no change in velocity or position, this obstacle poses negligible risk over the observed period.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

#### **Obstacle ID: 20045**
- **Distance Risk reason**: Static position fairly distant from the ego's path, located at a significant distance over time.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: Has remained stationary with zero velocity and acceleration; no risk of time-related collision.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

#### **Obstacle ID: 20048**
- **Distance Risk reason**: Located substantially away from ego, minimal movement and velocity reducing further scenario involvement.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: Movement reduced to zero velocity, posing no time-related threat; slowing trend further decreases risk.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

#### **Obstacle ID: 20051**
- **Distance Risk reason**: Initially close but gradually moving away with increasing gap from ego vehicle due to differing trajectory.
- **Distance safety score**: 4
- **Time Risk reason**: Negative acceleration with reducing velocity indicating moving away or parallel without direct intersection.
- **Time safety score**: 4
- **Overall Risk score**: 4

#### **Obstacle ID: 20052**
- **Distance Risk reason**: Sufficiently far and continues to increase over timesteps, moving swiftly in opposite direction.
- **Distance safety score**: 4
- **Time Risk reason**: Maintaining high velocity relative to ego, decreasing acceleration demonstrating negligible interaction over time.
- **Time safety score**: 4
- **Overall Risk score**: 4

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. Analyzed all obstacles within the same lanelet, with due consideration for trajectory and historical movements.
2. Observed that most obstacles are stationary or moving away from the ego or along other trajectories. 
3. Calculated distance and potential future intersections which proved unlikely.
4. Current positioning and their historical data demonstrate no impending collision.
