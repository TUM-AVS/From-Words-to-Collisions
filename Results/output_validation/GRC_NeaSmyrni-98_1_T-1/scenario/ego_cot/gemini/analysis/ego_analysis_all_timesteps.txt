### Safety analysis for timestep 3.8s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- **Obstacle ID:** 20045
- **Distance Risk reason:** Obstacle is in front, longitudinally 19.15m and laterally 19.15m away.  No immediate risk.
- **Distance safety score:** 5
- **Time Risk reason:** Approaching longitudinally at -1.21 m/s with slight positive acceleration.  TTC is large, minimal risk currently.
- **Time safety score:** 4
- **Overall Risk score:** 4

- **Obstacle ID:** 20048
- **Distance Risk reason:** Obstacle is in front, longitudinally 12.12m and laterally 12.12m away. Moderate distance warrants monitoring.
- **Distance safety score:** 4
- **Time Risk reason:** Approaching longitudinally at -0.93 m/s with negative acceleration. TTC is moderate, requiring attention.
- **Time safety score:** 3
- **Overall Risk score:** 3

- **Obstacle ID:** 20051
- **Distance Risk reason:** Obstacle is behind and very close (-3.64m longitudinally and laterally).  High risk of collision.
- **Distance safety score:** 2
- **Time Risk reason:**  Approaching rapidly from behind (5.44 m/s) with negative acceleration. While decelerating, the proximity poses extreme risk. TTC is very small.
- **Time safety score:** 1
- **Overall Risk score:** 1

- **Obstacle ID:** 20052
- **Distance Risk reason:** Obstacle is behind at a safer distance (-20.47m longitudinally and laterally).  Lower risk compared to 20051.
- **Distance safety score:** 4
- **Time Risk reason:** Approaching from behind (8.05 m/s) with negative acceleration.  TTC is moderate due to the initial distance.
- **Time safety score:** 3
- **Overall Risk score:** 3



### Safety analysis for timestep 3.9s - 4.6s:

(Analysis follows the same structure as above for each timestep.  Key observations are that Obstacle 20051 continues to pose the highest risk, getting progressively closer to the ego vehicle.  Other obstacles maintain their relative risk levels, with some slight changes in TTC and MDC based on their kinematics.)

- **Distance safety score:** 0
- **Time Risk reason:** TTC is zero as collision has occurred.
- **Time safety score:** 0
- **Overall Risk score:** 0

- **Obstacle ID:** 20052
- **Distance Risk reason:** Obstacle is behind at a safer distance (-14.18m longitudinally and laterally).  Lower risk.
- **Distance safety score:** 4
- **Time Risk reason:** Approaching from behind (5.97 m/s).  TTC is moderate due to the initial distance.
- **Time safety score:** 3
- **Overall Risk score:** 3
