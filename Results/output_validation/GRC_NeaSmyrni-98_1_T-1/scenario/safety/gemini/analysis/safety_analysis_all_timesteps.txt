### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
    - Obstacle ID: 20043
    - Relative Direction: Front-left
    - Distance Risk Reason: DTClong is > 5, indicating negligible longitudinal risk. DTClat is > 5 indicating negligible lateral risk. The obstacle remains far from the ego vehicle.
    - Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 5
    - Lateral Distance Safety Score: 5
    - Overall Distance Safety Score: 5.0
    - Time Risk Reason: TTClong is > 5, indicating negligible longitudinal risk. TTClat is inf, also indicating no lateral risk. The obstacle poses no immediate time-based threat.
    - Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 5
    - Lateral Time Safety Score: 5
    - Overall Time Safety Score: 5.0
    - Overall Risk Score: 5

    - Obstacle ID: 20045
    - Relative Direction: Front
    - Distance Risk Reason: DTClong is > 5, indicating negligible longitudinal risk. DTClat is 0, indicating no lateral risk as it is perfectly aligned longitudinally. The obstacle remains far ahead of the ego vehicle.
    - Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 5
    - Lateral Distance Safety Score: 5
    - Overall Distance Safety Score: 5.0
    - Time Risk Reason: TTClong is > 5, indicating negligible longitudinal risk. TTClat is 0 indicating no lateral risk as there is no lateral movement.  The obstacle poses no immediate time-based threat.
    - Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 5
    - Lateral Time Safety Score: 5
    - Overall Time Safety Score: 5.0
    - Overall Risk Score: 5

    - Obstacle ID: 20048
    - Relative Direction: Front
    - Distance Risk Reason: DTClong is > 5, indicating a low longitudinal risk but safe distance maintained. DTClat is 0, indicating no lateral risk, perfectly aligned longitudinally. The obstacle is ahead, but at a safe distance.
    - Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 4
    - Lateral Distance Safety Score: 5
    - Overall Distance Safety Score: 4.0
    - Time Risk Reason: TTClong is > 5, indicating negligible longitudinal time risk but decreasing. TTClat is 0, indicating no lateral risk, consistent with the longitudinal alignment. The obstacle is not an immediate threat, but the decreasing TTClong warrants monitoring.
    - Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 4
    - Lateral Time Safety Score: 5
    - Overall Time Safety Score: 4.0
    - Overall Risk Score: 4

    - Obstacle ID: 20051
    - Relative Direction: Collision
    - Distance Risk Reason: Both DTClong and DTClat are 0.0, indicating a collision.
    - Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 0
    - Lateral Distance Safety Score: 0
    - Overall Distance Safety Score: 0.0
    - Time Risk Reason: Both TTClong and TTClat are 0.0, confirming the collision.
    - Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 0
    - Lateral Time Safety Score: 0
    - Overall Time Safety Score: 0.0
    - Overall Risk Score: 0

    - Obstacle ID: 20052
    - Relative Direction: Behind
    - Distance Risk Reason: DTClong is < -5 (negative indicates behind), indicating negligible longitudinal risk. DTClat is 0, indicating no lateral risk due to longitudinal alignment.  Obstacle is well behind the ego vehicle.
    - Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 5
    - Lateral Distance Safety Score: 5
    - Overall Distance Safety Score: 5.0
    - Time Risk Reason: TTClong is around 2.5 and decreasing over time, indicating a medium risk.  TTClat is 0 indicating no lateral risk.  While the obstacle is behind and currently at a safe distance, the rapidly decreasing TTC suggests a potential risk of a rear-end collision if it continues closing in.
    - Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 3
    - Lateral Time Safety Score: 5
    - Overall Time Safety Score: 3.0
    - Overall Risk Score: 4
