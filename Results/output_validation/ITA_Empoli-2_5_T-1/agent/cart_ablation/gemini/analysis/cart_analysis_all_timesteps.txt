Obstacles 39 and 352 are in different lanelets and pose no immediate risk. Obstacle 358 is in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle and is approaching from behind at a higher speed. While not an immediate collision risk, it does represent a potential hazard if the ego vehicle were to decelerate suddenly. Obstacle 363 is also in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle, but further ahead and moving away, presenting no risk.

Obstacle 358 requires closer examination. Over the provided time steps, the distance between the ego vehicle and Obstacle 358 consistently decreases.  While a collision is not imminent within the timeframe of the data, the closing speeds and relatively small distance warrant classifying this obstacle as a high risk.
