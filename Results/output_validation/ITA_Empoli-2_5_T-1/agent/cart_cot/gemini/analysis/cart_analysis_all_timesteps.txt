Obstacle 358 is in the same lane as the ego vehicle and its x-coordinate is getting closer to the ego vehicle's x-coordinate over time. At t=2.4, the distance is about 2.1 meters. Additionally, obstacle 358's velocity is much greater than the ego vehicle's velocity and it is accelerating, increasing the risk of a collision. The TTC and MDC with Obstacle 358 are low and warrant a high risk score. The other obstacles do not present an immediate risk.
