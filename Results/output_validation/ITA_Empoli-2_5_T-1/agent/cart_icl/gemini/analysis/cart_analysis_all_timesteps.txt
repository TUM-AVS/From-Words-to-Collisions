Obstacle 358 is in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle and its distance is decreasing across time steps. At the last time step (2.4s), obstacle 358 is at (64.408536, 482.06018) and the ego vehicle is at (66.5117, 488.5635). Calculating approximate TTC and MDC requires more information like the shape and size of the vehicles, which is not provided. However, based on the distance, velocity, and acceleration information, a rough estimate suggests potential risk.

Obstacle 39 shows significant lateral movement and changes in lanelet. While the lateral distance seems large enough at the moment, its high speed and acceleration require attention. A more precise TTC and MDC calculation are needed to assess the risk accurately. However, given the available data, the risk is considered medium at this time.

Obstacle 352 shows similar behavior to Obstacle 39 in terms of lateral changes, although less prominent, and resides in a different lanelet.  The provided information suggests no immediate risk, but its movement should be monitored.

Obstacle 363, while in the same lanelet and behind the ego vehicle, maintains a safe distance and its movement does not suggest an immediate threat.
