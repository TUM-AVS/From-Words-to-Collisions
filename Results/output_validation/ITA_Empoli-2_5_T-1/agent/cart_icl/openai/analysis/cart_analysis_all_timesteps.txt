To assess the risk posed by each obstacle relative to the ego vehicle, let's examine the trajectory and positions of each entity over the sequence provided, especially focusing on the last timestep (at 2.4 seconds):

1. **Ego Vehicle:**
   - Position: (66.5117, 488.5635)
   - Velocity is decreasing and quite low: 0.3443 m/s
   - Lanelet: 1552.0

2. **Obstacle 39.0:**
   - Position at 2.4s: (67.022852, 498.71504)
   - Velocity: 9.1484939 m/s
   - Approaching very quickly and has accelerated recently.
   - Lanelet change indicates a potential dangerous path if it merges into ego's lanelet.
   - Risk Inference: Extreme (1), given rapid approach and closing distance in a different lanelet that could merge.

3. **Obstacle 352.0:**
   - Position at 2.4s: (73.989709, 502.71141)
   - Velocity: 2.4714611 m/s
   - Maintains a different lanelet and no immediate collision risk despite increased velocity.
   - Risk Inference: Low

4. **Obstacle 358.0:**
   - Position at 2.4s: (64.408536, 482.06018)
   - Velocity: 4.6716036 m/s
   - Same lanelet with ego, but moving away from the ego vehicle based on its trajectory.
   - Risk Inference: Medium due to same lanelet presence but diverging path.

5. **Obstacle 363.0:**
   - Position at 2.4s: (60.231446, 469.12522)
   - Velocity: 4.3482959 m/s
   - Same lanelet, closing in slower than 39.0, but distance and behavior don't suggest immediate threat.
   - Risk Inference: Medium due to same lanelet and closing behavior.

Overall, Obstacle 39.0 with its aggressive approach, changing lanelet, and high speed suggests it bears the highest risk of causing an imminent collision if de-lane merging behavior is not managed promptly. Obstacle 358.0 and 363.0 pose moderate risk due to their presence in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle.
