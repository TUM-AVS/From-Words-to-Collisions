At t=2.4s, Obstacle 39 is the most critical obstacle. It's approaching the ego vehicle head-on with a longitudinal distance of 5.32m and a small lateral offset of 1.00m, placing it in the Front-Left zone. Given its high closing velocity (-9.26 m/s) and the relatively short distance, a collision is possible within the next second if the trajectories remain unchanged. This warrants immediate attention and classifies it as a high-risk obstacle with proximity and MDC suggesting a risk score of 2. Although the lateral offset offers a small margin, the longitudinal closing rate is concerning.

Obstacle 352 maintains a safe distance and is moving away from the ego vehicle both longitudinally and laterally, presenting no immediate risk (risk score 5).

Obstacle 358, located behind the ego vehicle, is closing in at a moderate speed. However, the distance of -2.33m raises concerns.  This warrants attention and classifies it as a high-risk obstacle with proximity suggesting a risk score of 2, depending on the ego vehicle's subsequent motion.

Obstacle 363, also behind the ego vehicle, poses no immediate threat due to its larger distance (-15.92 m) and moderate relative velocity (risk score 4).
