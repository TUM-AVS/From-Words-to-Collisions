### Safety analysis for timestep 2.4s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

**- Obstacle ID: 39**
- Distance Risk reason: At 2.4s, Obstacle 39 is 5.32m in front and slightly to the left of the ego vehicle.  While moving away laterally, it is approaching longitudinally at a high relative speed (-9.26 m/s). The decreasing longitudinal distance suggests a medium risk.
- Distance safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
- Time Risk reason: Without precise ego vehicle motion, a precise TTC can't be calculated. However, the high closing velocity and decreasing distance suggest a TTC likely under 3 seconds. The consistent longitudinal approach of Obstacle 39 across all timesteps reinforces a time-based risk.
- Time safety score: 3 (Medium Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 3 (Medium Risk)

**- Obstacle ID: 352**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 352 is 11.25m diagonally front-right and moving away from the ego vehicle both longitudinally and laterally. This poses no immediate risk.
- Distance safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- Time Risk reason: The increasing distance and diverging motion suggest a very large TTC, indicating no risk.
- Time safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 5 (Negligible Risk)

**- Obstacle ID: 358**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 358 is 2.33m directly behind the ego vehicle and closing rapidly longitudinally (4.33 m/s).  This close proximity and high closing speed create a very high risk.
- Distance safety score: 2 (High Risk)
- Time Risk reason: The rapid approach and close proximity suggest a low TTC, potentially under 1 second. This presents an extreme risk.
- Time safety score: 2 (High Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 2 (High Risk)

**- Obstacle ID: 363**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 363 is 15.92m directly behind and approaching longitudinally. The large distance mitigates the risk.
- Distance safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- Time Risk reason: While closing, the significant distance suggests a comfortable TTC well over 5 seconds, presenting no immediate risk.
- Time safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
