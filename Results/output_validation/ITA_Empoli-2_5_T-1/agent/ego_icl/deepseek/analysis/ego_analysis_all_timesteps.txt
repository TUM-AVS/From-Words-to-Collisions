### Obstacle-by-Obstacle Analysis (Most Recent Timestep: 2.4 seconds)

#### **Obstacle 39 (Front-left)**
- **Adjusted Distance**: Longitudinal 5.32 m, Lateral 1.00 m  
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal -9.26 m/s (approaching), Lateral 2.04 m/s (moving away left)  
- **Motion**: Driving toward ego longitudinally but moving away laterally.  
- **TTC (Longitudinal)**: 5.32 / 9.26 ≈ 0.57 seconds (High Risk, TTC ≤ 1.0s)  
- **MDC (Lateral)**: 1.00 m (High Risk, but increasing due to lateral movement away)  
- **Trajectory**: Longitudinal distance decreasing rapidly, lateral distance increasing.  
- **Risk Assessment**: High Risk (2) due to rapid longitudinal approach, but lateral separation reduces collision likelihood.  

#### **Obstacle 352 (Front-right)**
- **Adjusted Distance**: Longitudinal 11.25 m, Lateral -1.20 m  
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal 1.69 m/s (moving away), Lateral -1.40 m/s (moving away right)  
- **Motion**: Moving away in both dimensions.  
- **TTC**: Not applicable (diverging paths).  
- **MDC**: > 5.0 m (No Risk).  
- **Risk Assessment**: Negligible Risk (5).  

#### **Obstacle 358 (Behind)**
- **Adjusted Distance**: Longitudinal -2.33 m, Lateral 0.00 m  
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal 4.33 m/s (approaching from behind), Lateral -0.01 m/s (negligible)  
- **Motion**: Driving toward ego from behind with exact lateral alignment.  
- **TTC (Longitudinal)**: 2.33 / 4.33 ≈ 0.54 seconds (Extreme Risk, TTC ≤ 0.5s threshold nearly met).  
- **MDC (Lateral)**: 0.00 m (alignment, but no lateral movement toward collision).  
- **Trajectory**: Rapidly closing longitudinal gap.  
- **Risk Assessment**: Extreme Risk (1) due to high rear approach speed and alignment.  

#### **Obstacle 363 (Behind)**
- **Adjusted Distance**: Longitudinal -15.92 m, Lateral 0.00 m  
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal 4.00 m/s (approaching from behind), Lateral -0.01 m/s (negligible)  
- **Motion**: Driving toward ego from behind with exact lateral alignment.  
- **TTC (Longitudinal)**: 15.92 / 4.00 ≈ 3.98 seconds (Low Risk, TTC > 3.0s).  
- **MDC (Lateral)**: 0.00 m (alignment, but no immediate risk).  
- **Risk Assessment**: Low Risk (4).

### **Key Findings**
1. **Obstacle 358** is the highest risk (Extreme Risk, score 1) due to rapid rear approach (TTC ≈ 0.54s) and lateral alignment.  
2. **Obstacle 39** is High Risk (score 2) but lateral divergence mitigates collision likelihood.  
3. No active collision (score 0) at the current timestep, but Obstacle 358 is predicted to pose imminent danger if trajectories persist.  
4. Obstacles 352 and 363 pose negligible/low risk.  

**Note**: Prioritize immediate deceleration or lane change to address Obstacle 358's rear approach.
