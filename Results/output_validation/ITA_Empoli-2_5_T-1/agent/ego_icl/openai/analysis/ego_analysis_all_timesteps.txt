**Analysis of Obstacles at the Most Recent Timestep (2.4 seconds):**

1. **Obstacle 39:**
   - **Direction and Motion:** Front-left of the ego car, approaching with decreasing longitudinal distance and lateral movement away.
   - **Distances:**
     - Adjusted Longitudinal: 5.32 m
     - Adjusted Lateral: 1.00 m
   - **Velocities:**
     - Longitudinal: -9.26 m/s (approaching)
     - Lateral: 2.04 m/s (moving away)
   - **TTC Calculation:**
     - Longitudinal TTC = 5.32 / 9.26 ≈ 0.57 seconds
   - **MDC Calculation:**
     - MDC is predominantly determined by longitudinal distance, projected to decrease to near zero due to high approaching velocity.
   - **Risk Assessment:** With a TTC < 1 second, this indicates a **High Risk (2)** due to rapid closing in longitudinal direction.

2. **Obstacle 352:**
   - **Direction and Motion:** Front-right of the ego car, moving away both longitudinally and laterally.
   - **Distances:**
     - Adjusted Longitudinal: 11.25 m
     - Adjusted Lateral: 1.20 m
   - **Velocities:**
     - Longitudinal: 1.69 m/s (moving away)
     - Lateral: -1.40 m/s (moving away)
   - **TTC and MDC:** Since the obstacle is moving away, both longitudinal and lateral distances will increase. MDC > 5.0 m and TTC > 5.0 s.
   - **Risk Assessment:** **Negligible Risk (5)** due to increasing distances.

3. **Obstacle 358:**
   - **Direction and Motion:** Behind the ego car, approaching with decreasing longitudinal distance.
   - **Distances:**
     - Adjusted Longitudinal: 2.33 m
     - Adjusted Lateral: 0.00 m
   - **Velocities:**
     - Longitudinal: 4.33 m/s (approaching)
   - **TTC Calculation:**
     - Longitudinal TTC = 2.33 / 4.33 ≈ 0.54 seconds
   - **MDC Calculation:**
     - Projected to decrease based on trajectory alignment.
   - **Risk Assessment:** **Extreme Risk (1)** due to very short TTC indicating imminent collision.

4. **Obstacle 363:**
   - **Direction and Motion:** Behind the ego car, approaching but with significant longitudinal distance.
   - **Distances:**
     - Adjusted Longitudinal: 15.92 m
     - Adjusted Lateral: 0.00 m
   - **Velocities:**
     - Longitudinal: 4.00 m/s (approaching)
   - **TTC Calculation:**
     - Longitudinal TTC = 15.92 / 4.00 ≈ 3.98 seconds
   - **MDC Calculation:**
     - Projected to be well above collision distance within the analyzed time.
   - **Risk Assessment:** **Low Risk (4)** given the sufficient distance and moderate closing speed.

**Final JSON Summary:**

```json
{
    "CollisionObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "39",
        "OverallRiskScore": "0"
    },
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "358",
        "OverallRiskScore": "1"
    },
    "HighRiskObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "39",
        "OverallRiskScore": "2"
    }
}
```

**Conclusion:**
- Obstacle 39 poses the most significant risk as it is approaching rapidly, indicating an immediate concern for High, possibly Extreme, risk levels within a very short timeframe.
- Obstacle 358 is poised for imminent collision, requiring immediate attention.
- Obstacle 352 and Obstacle 363 are assessed with minimal and manageable risks, given their trajectory and movement away or significant standoff distances respectively.
