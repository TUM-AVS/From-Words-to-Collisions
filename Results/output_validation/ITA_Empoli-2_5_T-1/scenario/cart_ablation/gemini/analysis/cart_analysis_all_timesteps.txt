At t=2.6s, Ego is at (66.53, 488.63) in lanelet 1552.  Let's analyze the closest obstacles:

* **Obstacle 39:** Located in lanelet 3198 at (66.12, 497.09).  While the y-coordinate difference is significant (~8.5), its trajectory shows it moving aggressively towards the ego vehicle's lanelet and closing the distance rapidly.  This obstacle *could* pose a risk in the coming seconds, but at this precise moment, it's not an immediate threat.  Risk score: 3 (Medium Risk)

* **Obstacle 352:** Positioned at (74.42, 503.05) in lanelet 3043. Given its current position and trajectory, it presents no immediate danger. Risk score: 5 (Negligible risk).

* **Obstacle 358:** At (64.70, 482.97) in lanelet 1552, the same lane as Ego.  This obstacle is relatively close and moving in the same direction as Ego, but it is behind Ego and poses no immediate threat, even though it is accelerating. Risk score: 4 (Low Risk)

* **Obstacle 363:** Located at (60.51, 469.98) in lanelet 1552. This obstacle is also in Ego's lanelet, but is significantly behind Ego and poses no immediate threat. Risk score: 5 (Negligible Risk).
