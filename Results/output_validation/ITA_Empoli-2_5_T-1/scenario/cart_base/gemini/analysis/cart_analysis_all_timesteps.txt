Obstacle 358 is in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle and is rapidly approaching from behind.  At the last timestep (2.6 seconds), Obstacle 358's position is (64.70, 482.97) with a velocity of 4.93 m/s, and accelerating. Ego's position is (66.53, 488.63) with a velocity of 0.26 m/s, and decelerating. Given the speed differential and decreasing distance, a collision is highly likely in the next few timesteps if this trend continues.

Obstacle 363 is also in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle and ahead of it. While further away than Obstacle 358, its closing velocity is still considerable.  At the last timestep, Obstacle 363's position is (60.51, 469.98) with a velocity of 4.58 m/s and accelerating.  Ego's position is (66.53, 488.63) with a velocity of 0.26 m/s and decelerating. The distance is decreasing and the speed differential is significant, presenting a high risk.
