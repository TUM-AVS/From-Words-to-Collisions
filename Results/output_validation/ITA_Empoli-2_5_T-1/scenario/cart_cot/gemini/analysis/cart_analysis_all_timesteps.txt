### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 39.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 39.0 is in a different lanelet (3198.0) than the ego vehicle (1552.0).  Its trajectory over the past several timesteps shows it moving away from the ego vehicle.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: The velocity and acceleration of Obstacle 39.0 indicate it is moving away from the ego vehicle.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 352.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 352.0 is in a different lanelet (3043.0) than the ego vehicle (1552.0).  While its Y-coordinate is relatively close to the ego vehicle, its X-coordinate places it to the side and its trajectory suggests continued lateral separation.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: The velocity and acceleration of Obstacle 352.0, while increasing, do not pose an immediate threat given the lateral separation.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- Obstacle ID: 358.0
- Distance Risk reason:  Obstacle 358.0 is in the same lanelet (1552.0) as the ego vehicle and is behind it.  Its historical trajectory shows that it is approaching the ego vehicle.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: While Obstacle 358.0 is accelerating and approaching, it is still a reasonable distance away and the ego vehicle is also moving.  This warrants monitoring but isn't an immediate threat.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- Obstacle ID: 363.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 363.0 is in the same lanelet (1552.0) as the ego vehicle and further behind than Obstacle 358.0.  Its trajectory indicates it is also approaching the ego vehicle.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason:  While Obstacle 363.0 is also accelerating, its greater distance and the ego vehicle's movement mean the risk is lower than Obstacle 358.0.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5


### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. **Most critical obstacles:** Obstacles 358.0 and 363.0 are the most critical as they share the same lanelet as the ego vehicle and are approaching from behind.
2. **Trajectory analysis:** Over the 10 timesteps, both obstacles have consistently been behind the ego vehicle in the same lanelet, gradually reducing the distance. Obstacle 358.0 is closer and approaching slightly faster than Obstacle 363.0.
3. **Relative position, velocity, and acceleration:** The ego vehicle's velocity is decreasing, while both obstacles are accelerating. This indicates a potential for the gap to close more rapidly in the future.
4. **Collision determination:**  At the current timestep (2.6 seconds), there is no collision.  However, continued acceleration by the obstacles and deceleration of the ego vehicle could lead to a risky situation in the near future.
5. **Reasoning:** Although currently safe, the trends suggest increased risk with Obstacle 358.0 warranting close monitoring.  A collision is not imminent but the possibility requires attention.


### Summary in JSON Format:

{
  "CollisionObstacles": null,
  "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null,
  "ScenarioAnalysis": {
    "IsCollisionScenario": false,
    "Reasoning": "No collision has occurred.  Obstacles 358.0 and 363.0 are approaching the ego vehicle from behind in the same lane, but at the current timestep, a safe distance is maintained. The trends in velocity and acceleration suggest a potential for increased risk in the near future, especially with Obstacle 358.0, requiring continuous monitoring."
