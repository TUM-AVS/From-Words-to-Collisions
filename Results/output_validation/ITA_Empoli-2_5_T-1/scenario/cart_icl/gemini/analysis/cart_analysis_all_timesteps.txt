### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 39.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is in a different lanelet and moving away from the ego vehicle.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason:  Relative velocity and direction indicate no risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 352.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is in a different lanelet and poses no immediate threat.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Relative velocity and direction indicate no risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 358.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is in the same lanelet and approaching the ego vehicle, but sufficient distance remains.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: The closing rate is moderate but manageable.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- Obstacle ID: 363.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is in the same lanelet, further behind than obstacle 358, and poses less risk.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Relative velocity and direction suggest no immediate concern.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
No obstacles have a risk score of 0, therefore this is not a collision scenario.  There are no immediate or extreme risks present.  The closest obstacle (358) is approaching, but at a manageable rate, presenting a low risk.

### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
  "CollisionObstacles": [],
  "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null,
  "ScenarioAnalysis": {
    "IsCollisionScenario": false,
    "Reasoning": "No obstacle has a risk score of 0. Obstacle 358 presents the highest risk but is still classified as low (score 4) due to sufficient distance and manageable closing rate."
  }
}
```
