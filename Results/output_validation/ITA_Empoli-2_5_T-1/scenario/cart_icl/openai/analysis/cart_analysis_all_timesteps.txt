### Obstacle Analysis:

#### Obstacle ID: 39
- **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle 39 is on a different lanelet (3198.0 at the most recent timestep) and is moving away from the ego vehicle in terms of relative orientation and position over time.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: Despite having a high velocity and acceleration, it's trajectory indicates it is moving further from the ego vehicle with no converging trajectory in recent timesteps.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 352
- **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is consistently on a separate trajectory (lanelet 3043.0) from the ego vehicle and staying along its trajectory path without any projected intersection.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: Obstacle 352 maintains a steady, low-speed vector, moving tangentially relative to the ego, which minimizes collision risk.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 358
- **Distance Risk reason**: Obstacle 358 shares the same lanelet as the ego vehicle (1552.0) with a forward trajectory relative to the ego.
- **Distance safety score**: 3
- **Time Risk reason**: With increasing velocity and acceleration trends, there exists a moderate risk of converging paths, pending its higher speed relative to the slower ego.
- **Time safety score**: 3
- **Overall Risk score**: 3

#### Obstacle ID: 363
- **Distance Risk reason**: Obstacle 363 shares the lanelet with the ego (1552.0) but is positioned further away longitudinally, not immediately in the direct path but within proximity.
- **Distance safety score**: 4
- **Time Risk reason**: The obstacleâ€™s acceleration and consistent trajectory indicate minimal risk of collision, as it is moving longitudinally at a moderate and manageable speed.
- **Time safety score**: 4
- **Overall Risk score**: 4

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
Based on the positions and the trajectory patterns of all obstacles, none appear to be in immediate danger of colliding with the ego vehicle. Obstacle 358 presents a moderate risk due to shared trajectory and velocities, but still maintains a manageable buffer distance. No obstacle indicates an immediate collision path or direct extreme risk scenario.
