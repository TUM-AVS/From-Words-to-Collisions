Obstacle 39 is in the Front-left and is approaching the ego vehicle longitudinally with decreasing lateral distance, posing a potential collision risk. The longitudinal distance is 3.42m and lateral distance is 1.37m. Obstacle 358 is behind the ego vehicle and approaching longitudinally with a decreasing distance of -1.44m, and exact lateral alignment. This poses a high risk of collision.

    "Reasoning": "Obstacle 358 poses an extreme risk with a longitudinal distance of -1.44m and closing velocity, indicating a likely collision in the next timestep. Although obstacle 39 is also approaching, it does not represent an immediate collision risk as Obstacle 358 does."
