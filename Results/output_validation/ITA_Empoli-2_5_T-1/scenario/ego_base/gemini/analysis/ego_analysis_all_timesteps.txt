Obstacle 39 is in the Front-left and is approaching the ego vehicle longitudinally at high relative velocity (-9.65 m/s) and is very close (3.42 m).  Although it's moving laterally away from the ego vehicle (1.37 m lateral distance), the longitudinal closing rate suggests a very high risk of collision in the immediate future.

Obstacle 358 is behind the ego vehicle and approaching longitudinally with a high relative velocity (4.67 m/s) and is extremely close (-1.44 m). This indicates a very high probability of a rear-end collision in the next few moments.

**Risk Levels and Definitions:**
<Collision (Score: 0)>: Actual collision has occurred or is unavoidable within the next timestep.
<Extreme Risk (Score: 1)>: Immediate collision or very high likelihood of impact. Urgent action is required.
<High Risk (Score: 2)>: Close to collision or highly probable collision path. Needs prompt attention and quick manoeuvring.
<Medium Risk (Score: 3)>: Moderate collision risk but manageable with timely reactions and proper strategies.
<Low Risk (Score: 4)>: Minimal collision risk. The situation is controllable with sufficient time to react.
<Negligible Risk (Score: 5)>: No significant collision risk. Obstacles are either moving away or far enough not to interfere.

    "Reasoning": "Obstacle 39 poses an extreme risk due to its close proximity (3.42m) and high longitudinal closing velocity (-9.65 m/s), despite moving laterally away. Obstacle 358, though very close and approaching rapidly from behind, does not represent a collision in the immediate next timestep, thus making it extremely high risk but not yet a collision. No collision has occurred yet."
