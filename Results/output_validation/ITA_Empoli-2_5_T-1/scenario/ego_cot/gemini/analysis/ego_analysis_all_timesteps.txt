### Safety analysis for timestep 1.7s - 2.6s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

The provided data shows a concerning situation with Obstacle 39 and Obstacle 358.  While other obstacles are moving away and pose no immediate threat, these two require detailed analysis. Note that the "exact lateral alignment or unknown case" for Obstacles 39 and 358 introduces significant uncertainty, and we must assume a worst-case scenario (direct collision course) for safety evaluation.

**Calculations and Reasoning:**

Since precise ego vehicle motion is not given, TTC is approximated using  `TTC â‰ˆ Distance / Relative Velocity`. This simplification is necessary given the available data.  However, a more comprehensive analysis would incorporate both ego and obstacle accelerations for accurate TTC calculation.

**Assumptions for Risk Assessment:**

* **Direct Collision Path:** Due to the uncertainty of "exact lateral alignment or unknown case," we must assume the worst-case scenario for Obstacles 39 and 358, meaning they are on a direct collision course with the ego vehicle. This conservative approach prioritizes safety.
* **Lack of Evasive Actions:** The evaluation assumes no evasive action is taken by either the ego vehicle or the obstacles.

### Obstacle Analysis:

**General Note:** For Obstacles 352, 363, since they are moving away from the ego vehicle both longitudinally and laterally, they are assigned a safety score of 5 for both distance and time risk, resulting in an overall risk score of 5.

**Obstacle 39:**
- Obstacle ID: 39
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 39 is approaching the ego vehicle longitudinally, decreasing from 11.25m to 3.42m within the analyzed timeframe. The lateral distance also decreases, but the "exact lateral alignment" warning indicates a potential direct collision course.  This represents a rapidly increasing risk.
- Distance safety score:  Score transitions from 3 (1.7s) to 1 (2.6s).
- Time Risk reason: With the negative longitudinal relative velocity and decreasing distance, a collision appears increasingly likely within the next second unless evasive action is taken.
- Time safety score: Score transitions from 2 (1.7s) to 1 (2.6s).
- Overall Risk score: Transitions from 2 (1.7s) to 1 (2.6s).

**Obstacle 352:**
- Obstacle ID: 352
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 352 maintains a safe distance and is moving away from the ego vehicle.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: The positive relative longitudinal velocity and increasing distance indicate no collision risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

**Obstacle 358:**
- Obstacle ID: 358
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 358 is approaching the ego vehicle from behind, with the longitudinal distance decreasing from -4.81m to -1.44m. The small and nearly constant lateral distance combined with "exact lateral alignment" implies a potential rear-end collision.
- Distance safety score: Transitions from 2 (1.7s) to 1 (2.6s)
- Time Risk reason: The positive relative longitudinal velocity and decreasing distance indicates a potential rear-end collision within the next few seconds unless evasive action is taken.
- Time safety score: Transitions from 2 (1.7s) to 1 (2.6s)
- Overall Risk score: Transitions from 2 (1.7s) to 1 (2.6s)

**Obstacle 363:**
- Obstacle ID: 363
- Distance Risk reason: Though approaching from behind, obstacle 363 maintains a large longitudinal distance and poses no immediate threat.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: The relative motion and distance suggest no imminent collision risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

  },
  "IsCollisionScenario": false,
  "Justification": "Obstacle 39 presents an extreme risk of collision with decreasing distance and negative relative velocity. While not a confirmed collision yet, it reaches an overall risk score of 1 (Extreme Risk) at the end of the provided timeframe (2.6 seconds). Obstacle 358 also presents an extreme risk, approaching rapidly from behind, but no collision is predicted in the given time frame."
