### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
    - Obstacle ID: 39
    - Relative Direction: Front-left
    - Distance Risk Reason: DTClong is 3.42m, indicating a medium risk. DTClat is 1.37m which, despite being a high lateral risk, is mitigated by the obstacle moving away laterally to the left and the front-left relative direction. The obstacle has been approaching longitudinally and moving away laterally over the past timesteps.
    - Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 3
    - Lateral Distance Safety Score: 2
    - Overall Distance Safety Score: 2.5
    - Time Risk Reason: TTClong is 0.35s, indicating an extreme risk. TTClat is inf, meaning no lateral collision risk. The obstacle has been consistently approaching longitudinally over the past timesteps with decreasing TTClong.  
    - Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 1
    - Lateral Time Safety Score: 5
    - Overall Time Safety Score: 3
    - Overall Risk Score: 3

    - Obstacle ID: 352
    - Relative Direction: Front-right
    - Distance Risk Reason: Both DTClong (11.64m) and DTClat (-1.48m) indicate negligible risk. The obstacle is moving away both longitudinally and laterally to the right.
    - Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 5
    - Lateral Distance Safety Score: 5
    - Overall Distance Safety Score: 5.0
    - Time Risk Reason: Both TTClong and TTClat are inf, indicating no collision risk. The obstacle has been consistently moving away in both directions.
    - Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 5
    - Lateral Time Safety Score: 5
    - Overall Time Safety Score: 5.0
    - Overall Risk Score: 5

    - Obstacle ID: 358
    - Relative Direction: Behind
    - Distance Risk Reason: DTClong is -1.44m, presenting a high risk. DTClat is 0.0m, indicating no lateral risk. The obstacle has been approaching longitudinally from behind.
    - Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 2
    - Lateral Distance Safety Score: 5
    - Overall Distance Safety Score: 2.0
    - Time Risk Reason: TTClong is 0.31s, indicating an extreme risk as a rear-end collision is imminent. TTClat is 0.00, representing no lateral time-based risk. TTClong has been decreasing consistently over the previous timesteps, escalating the risk of collision.
    - Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 1
    - Lateral Time Safety Score: 5
    - Overall Time Safety Score: 1.0
    - Overall Risk Score: 2

    - Obstacle ID: 363
    - Relative Direction: Behind
    - Distance Risk Reason: DTClong is -15.10m and DTClat is 0.0m, indicating negligible distance-based risk, as the obstacle is far behind. DTC has consistently stayed large over the past timesteps.
    - Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 5
    - Lateral Distance Safety Score: 5
    - Overall Distance Safety Score: 5.0
    - Time Risk Reason: TTClong is 3.49s and TTClat is 0.0m indicating a low longitudinal time-based risk and no lateral time-based risk. The obstacle is approaching but with ample time to react.
    - Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 4
    - Lateral Time Safety Score: 5
    - Overall Time Safety Score: 4.0
    - Overall Risk Score: 5
