Here's the collision risk analysis for the provided scenario:

**Analysis:**

* **Obstacle 31:** This obstacle is consistently located in lanelet 6947, while the ego vehicle is in lanelet 6956.  The positions and trajectories suggest no immediate risk of collision. Risk score: 5 (Negligible risk).

* **Obstacles 35, 36, 310, 315:** These obstacles are all in lanelet 6586. While they are in proximity to the ego vehicle's lane, their trajectories don't indicate an immediate collision risk within the given timeframe.  Further monitoring is needed depending on future movements. Risk scores: 4 (Low Risk) but warranting continued observation.

* **Obstacle 317:** This obstacle starts in proximity to the ego vehicle (both in lanelets 6956 and 3399 initially) and shows a rapidly increasing velocity and some acceleration towards the ego vehicle. Although not colliding in the presented timeframe, the rapid approach warrants a higher risk assessment. Risk Score: 2 (High risk) due to closing speed.

* **Obstacle 320:** Similar to Obstacle 317, this obstacle is also in lanelet 3399 and accelerating, but its trajectory and distance from the ego vehicle pose less of a risk.  Risk score: 3 (Medium risk).

* **Obstacle 355:** This obstacle, located in lanelet 6586, exhibits a high velocity and is moving towards the ego vehicle's projected path.  This warrants a medium risk assessment.  Risk score: 3 (Medium risk).
