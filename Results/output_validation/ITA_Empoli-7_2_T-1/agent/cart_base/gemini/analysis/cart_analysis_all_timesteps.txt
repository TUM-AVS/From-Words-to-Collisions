Obstacle 31: This obstacle is located in a different lanelet and its y-coordinate is significantly different from the ego vehicle, suggesting a safe lateral separation. The trajectories show no indication of convergence, indicating low collision risk. Risk score: 4

Obstacle 35, 36, 310, 315, 355: These obstacles are in lanelet 6586, which appears to be somewhat close to the ego vehicle's lanelet (6956). However, their y-coordinates are consistently lower than the ego vehicle's, maintaining a safe distance. The trajectories indicate no immediate risk of collision. Risk score: 3-4 (Medium to Low)

Obstacle 317 and 320: These obstacles are in lanelet 3399. Obstacle 317 shows concerning behavior. It starts at (219.67938, -590.52724) at t=1.1s and ends at (214.63747, -591.62653) at t=2.0s.  It's rapidly approaching the ego vehicle in both x and y coordinates and has a significantly higher velocity. While a collision hasn't happened yet in the provided timeframe, the trend strongly suggests an imminent collision. Risk score: 1 (Extreme Risk for 317).

Obstacle 320 also shares the same lanelet as 317 and is moving in a similar direction, but its initial position and velocity suggest a lower immediate risk than 317. It's still important to monitor this obstacle. Risk score: 2-3 (High to Medium)
