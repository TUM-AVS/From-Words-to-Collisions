Obstacle 317 shows concerning behavior.  Its velocity is rapidly increasing (from 4.97 m/s to 6.54 m/s) while heading towards the ego vehicle's lane. Although not immediately colliding, this trend suggests a high probability of a near-term collision if the obstacle continues on its current path. Obstacle 317 is flagged as highest risk.

Obstacle 320 is also accelerating (from 2.76 m/s to 4.13 m/s) in the same lane as Obstacle 317 and generally towards the ego vehicle, requiring attention and marking as a high risk.
