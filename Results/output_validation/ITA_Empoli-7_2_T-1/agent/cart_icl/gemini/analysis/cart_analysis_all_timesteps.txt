Obstacle 317 shows a concerning trend.  Its longitudinal velocity is significantly higher than the ego vehicle's, and it's rapidly decreasing in distance to the ego.  While not immediately colliding in this timestep, the rapid approach suggests a high risk of collision in the near future if this trend continues.  A similar, though less severe, concern exists for obstacle 320, which is also accelerating towards the ego. Obstacle 355 is also accelerating and relatively close laterally to the ego vehicle. At the current rate, it could pose a risk in the next few seconds.
