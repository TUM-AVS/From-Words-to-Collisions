To analyze the scenario, let's determine the relative positions, velocities, and potential risks for each obstacle with respect to the Ego vehicle at the most recent timestep (2.0 seconds).

### Detailed Analysis

1. **Ego Vehicle (ID: 1.0)**
   - Position: (209.0204, -592.9505), Velocity: 1.7999 m/s
   - Moving consistently in lanelet 6956.0 with very low acceleration at this timestep.

2. **Obstacle 31.0**
   - Position: (197.39052, -614.40431), Velocity: 1.767723 m/s
   - Relative longitudinal position: -11.63m (behind ego)
   - Relative longitudinal velocity: -0.032177 (slightly slower, separating)
   - Distance is increasing - **Negligible risk**.

3. **Obstacle 35.0**
   - Position: (185.62975, -584.00129), Velocity: 1.6025436 m/s
   - Same lanelet as other obstacles but not closely aligned or rapidly approaching.
   - **Low Risk** due to slight speed and different path.

4. **Obstacle 36.0**
   - Position: (187.73488, -583.63305), Velocity: 2.6507991 m/s
   - Seems further away laterally and longitudinally - **Low Risk**.

5. **Obstacle 310.0**
   - Position: (190.59998, -597.58536), Velocity: 1.262683 m/s
   - Approximate some distance behind, decelerating compared to Ego.
   - **Negligible risk**.

6. **Obstacle 315.0**
   - Position: (186.56095, -587.84591), Velocity: 1.642965 m/s
   - Similarly aligned but slower - consistent pattern across timesteps.
   - **Low Risk**.

7. **Obstacle 317.0**
   - Position: (214.63747, -591.62653), Velocity: 6.5435226 m/s
   - Moving faster than Ego, in the opposite direction.
   - TTC is negative, meaning already passed or overtaken Ego but moving away fast.
   - **Negligible risk** given speed and separating direction.

8. **Obstacle 320.0**
   - Position: (233.27512, -587.57933), Velocity: 4.1288223 m/s
   - Farther laterally and longitudinally - **Negligible risk**.

9. **Obstacle 355.0**
   - Position: (193.86199, -615.95206), Velocity: 9.075277 m/s
   - Rapidly approaching from behind.
   - Relative velocity to Ego is high, closing in.
   - **Extreme risk** (1) due to approaching speed and trajectory.

### Summary of potential risks from detailed analysis:

- **Collision Risk (0):** None
- **Extreme Risk (1):** Obstacle 355.0
- **High Risk (2):** None
