At t=2.0s, several obstacles present varying levels of risk to the ego vehicle.

* **Obstacle 31:** Located front-left, this obstacle poses a medium risk. Although the lateral distance is significant (15.35m), the longitudinal distance is moderate (13.04m) and decreasing.  The combined motion suggests a risk score of 3.

* **Obstacle 35:** Situated front-right, this obstacle presents a medium risk with a score of 3.  The longitudinal distance (15.11m) and lateral distance (-13.96m) are moderate, with converging lateral movement.

* **Obstacle 36:**  Also front-right, this obstacle is closer than Obstacle 35 longitudinally (12.99m) and has a higher lateral velocity towards the ego vehicle, representing a medium risk with a score of 3.

* **Obstacle 310:** Directly in front of the ego vehicle, this obstacle is at a medium risk. The decreasing longitudinal distance (14.45m) and lateral motion towards the ego raise concerns, resulting in a risk score of 3.

* **Obstacle 315:**  Front-right, this obstacle is at a medium risk, similar to Obstacle 35, due to its longitudinal distance (15.38m) and lateral movement.  The risk score is 3.

* **Obstacle 317:** Located behind the ego, this obstacle is an extreme risk. The very small longitudinal distance (-1.25m) and high closing velocity indicate an imminent collision potential, resulting in a risk score of 1.

* **Obstacle 320:**  Positioned behind and slightly to the left, this obstacle poses a low risk due to the large longitudinal distance (-20.24m). The risk score is 4.

* **Obstacle 355:**  This front-left obstacle presents a low risk. While it is moving slightly towards the ego longitudinally (16.87m), its significant and increasing lateral distance (15.77m) minimizes collision risk. The risk score is 4.
