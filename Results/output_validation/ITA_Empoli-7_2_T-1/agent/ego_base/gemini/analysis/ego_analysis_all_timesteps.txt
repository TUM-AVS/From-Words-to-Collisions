* **Obstacle 31:** Front-left, 13.04m longitudinal, 15.35m lateral distance. Moving towards ego car both longitudinally and laterally.  Risk score: 4 (Low Risk). It's relatively far and though moving closer, there's time to react.

* **Obstacle 35:** Front-right, 15.11m longitudinal, -13.96m lateral distance. Moving towards ego car both longitudinally and laterally. Risk score: 4 (Low Risk), similar to Obstacle 31.

* **Obstacle 36:** Front-right, 12.99m longitudinal, -13.68m lateral distance. Moving towards ego car both longitudinally and laterally. Risk score: 4 (Low Risk). Slightly closer than 31 and 35, but still manageable.

* **Obstacle 310:** Front, 14.45m longitudinal, 0.00m lateral distance. Moving towards ego car longitudinally. Risk score: 4 (Low Risk). Moderate longitudinal distance and no immediate lateral threat.

* **Obstacle 315:** Front-right, 15.38m longitudinal, -10.02m lateral distance. Moving towards ego car both longitudinally and laterally. Risk score: 4 (Low Risk). Similar risk profile to other front obstacles.

* **Obstacle 317:** Behind, -1.25m longitudinal, 0.00m lateral distance. Moving quickly towards ego car from behind. Risk score: 2 (High Risk) due to close proximity and high relative velocity from behind, requiring prompt action.

* **Obstacle 320:** Rear-left, -20.24m longitudinal, 0.57m lateral distance. Moving towards ego car from behind and slightly to the left. Risk score: 4 (Low Risk). Although approaching, it's still far behind.

* **Obstacle 355:** Front-left, 16.87m longitudinal, 15.77m lateral distance. Moving towards ego car longitudinally but away laterally. Risk score: 4 (Low Risk) due to sufficient distance and diverging lateral movement.


Risk Levels:
0: Collision - Physical contact occurred or unavoidable
1: Extreme Risk - Immediate collision likely
2: High Risk - Close to collision, needs quick action
3: Medium Risk - Manageable with proper reaction
4: Low Risk - Minimal risk, sufficient time to react
5: Negligible Risk - No significant risk
