### Safety analysis for timestep 2.0s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

**Assumptions and Clarifications:**

* Since the provided scenario lacks ego vehicle dimensions and adjusted distances (adjusted_d_long, adjusted_d_lat), I will use the provided real distances (DTClong, DTClat) as approximations for the analysis.  This might slightly underestimate the risk. *In a real-world application, always use adjusted distances for accurate collision risk assessment.*
*  I'm assuming a simplified TTC calculation: `TTC = Distance / Relative Velocity`.  A more sophisticated approach would consider acceleration and predict the closest point of approach, but this is not feasible with the data provided.
* I'm inferring lateral movement relative to the ego vehicle based on the sign of Vrel_lat. Positive Vrel_lat suggests the obstacle is moving to the right of the ego vehicle, while negative Vrel_lat indicates movement to the left.

### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 31**
    - Distance Risk reason:  Located at approximately 13.04m longitudinally and 13.04m laterally (front-left).  This distance is substantial.
    - Distance safety score: 5
    - Time Risk reason:  Approaching longitudinally and laterally (-2.12 m/s and -1.74 m/s). The time to collision is relatively high given the distance.
    - Time safety score: 5
    - Overall Risk score: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 35**
    - Distance Risk reason:  Located at approximately 15.11m longitudinally and 15.11m laterally (front-right). Safe distance.
    - Distance safety score: 5
    - Time Risk reason: Approaching longitudinally but moving right laterally (-1.73 m/s, 1.60 m/s).  Low risk due to distance and lateral movement.
    - Time safety score: 5
    - Overall Risk score: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 36**
    - Distance Risk reason: Located at approximately 12.99m longitudinally and 12.99m laterally (front-right). Reasonable distance.
    - Distance safety score: 5
    - Time Risk reason: Approaching longitudinally and moving right laterally (-1.69 m/s and 2.65 m/s). The lateral movement decreases the collision risk.
    - Time safety score: 5
    - Overall Risk score: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 310**
    - Distance Risk reason: Located approximately 14.45m longitudinally and 14.45m laterally in the front.  This distance presents no immediate risk.
    - Distance safety score: 5
    - Time Risk reason: Approaching longitudinally and moving right slightly (-1.71 m/s and 1.26 m/s), but plenty of time to react.
    - Time safety score: 5
    - Overall Risk score: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 315**
    - Distance Risk reason: Approximately 15.38m longitudinally and 15.38m laterally (front-right). Safe distance.
    - Distance safety score: 5
    - Time Risk reason: Approaching longitudinally and moving right laterally (-1.72 m/s and 1.64 m/s). Low risk due to the distance and lateral movement.
    - Time safety score: 5
    - Overall Risk score: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 317**
    - Distance Risk reason: Located approximately 1.25m behind the ego vehicle. This close proximity represents a very high risk.
    - Distance safety score: 1
    - Time Risk reason: Approaching rapidly from behind (4.72 m/s). High risk of collision.
    - Time safety score: 1
    - Overall Risk score: 1

- **Obstacle ID: 320**
    - Distance Risk reason: Located approximately 20.24m behind the ego vehicle.  Relatively safe distance.
    - Distance safety score: 5
    - Time Risk reason:  Approaching from behind (2.31 m/s) but sufficient distance for reaction.
    - Time safety score: 5
    - Overall Risk score: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 355**
    - Distance Risk reason: Approximately 16.87 m longitudinally and 16.87m laterally (front-left). Safe distance.
    - Distance safety score: 5
    - Time Risk reason: Barely approaching longitudinally and moving left rapidly (-0.10 m/s and 8.92 m/s). The lateral movement indicates diverging paths, reducing collision risk.
    - Time safety score: 5
    - Overall Risk score: 5
