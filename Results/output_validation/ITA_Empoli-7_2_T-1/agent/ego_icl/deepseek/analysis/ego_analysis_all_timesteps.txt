Let me analyze each obstacle at the most recent timestep (2.0 seconds) and assess collision risks:

1. Obstacle 31 (Front-left):
   - Longitudinal: 13.04m closing at -2.12m/s → TTC = 6.15s
   - Lateral: 15.35m closing at -1.74m/s → TTC = 8.82s
   - Both distances large (>5m) with TTC >5s → Risk 5

2. Obstacle 35 (Front-right):
   - Longitudinal: 15.11m closing at -1.73m/s → TTC = 8.73s
   - Lateral: -13.96m closing at 1.60m/s → TTC = 8.73s
   - Both distances large (>5m) with TTC >5s → Risk 5

3. Obstacle 36 (Front-right):
   - Longitudinal: 12.99m closing at -1.69m/s → TTC = 7.69s
   - Lateral: -13.68m closing at 2.65m/s → TTC = 5.16s
   - Both distances large (>5m) with TTC >5s → Risk 5

4. Obstacle 310 (Front):
   - Longitudinal: 14.45m closing at -1.71m/s → TTC = 8.45s
   - Lateral: 0.00m but moving away at 1.26m/s
   - No lateral risk, longitudinal TTC >5s → Risk 5

5. Obstacle 315 (Front-right):
   - Longitudinal: 15.38m closing at -1.72m/s → TTC = 8.94s
   - Lateral: -10.02m closing at 1.64m/s → TTC = 6.11s
   - Both distances large (>5m) with TTC >5s → Risk 5

6. Obstacle 317 (Behind):
   - Longitudinal: -1.25m closing at 4.72m/s → TTC = 0.26s (Extreme Risk)
   - Lateral: 0.00m closing at -0.59m/s → TTC = 0s
   - Very close with high closing speed → Risk 0 (Collision)

7. Obstacle 320 (Rear-left):
   - Longitudinal: -20.24m closing at 2.31m/s → TTC = 8.76s
   - Lateral: 0.57m closing at -0.38m/s → TTC = 1.5s
   - Longitudinal safe, lateral Medium Risk → Risk 3

8. Obstacle 355 (Front-left):
   - Longitudinal: 16.87m closing at -0.10m/s → TTC = 168.7s
   - Lateral: 15.77m moving away at 8.92m/s
   - Diverging paths → Risk 5
