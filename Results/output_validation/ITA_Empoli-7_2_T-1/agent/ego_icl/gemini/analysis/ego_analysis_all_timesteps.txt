Obstacle 31 (Front-Left):
- Trajectory: Consistently front-left, approaching longitudinally and laterally.
- At t=2.0s: Longitudinal distance >5m, Lateral distance >5m.  Relative velocity is negative in both directions indicating closing.
- TTC (longitudinal): 13.04m / 2.12 m/s ≈ 6.15s
- TTC (lateral): 15.35m / 1.74 m/s ≈ 8.82s
- MDC: Not applicable for diagonal, use individual distances.
- Risk: 5 (Negligible Risk)

Obstacle 35 (Front-Right):
- Trajectory: Consistently front-right, approaching longitudinally, moving right laterally.
- At t=2.0s: Longitudinal distance >5m, Lateral distance >5m. Relative velocity is negative longitudinally and positive laterally.
- TTC (longitudinal): 15.11m / 1.73 m/s ≈ 8.73s
- TTC (lateral): Not applicable as moving away laterally
- MDC: Not applicable for diagonal, use individual distances.
- Risk: 5 (Negligible Risk)

Obstacle 36 (Front-Right):
- Trajectory: Consistently front-right, approaching longitudinally and moving right laterally.
- At t=2.0s: Longitudinal distance >5m, Lateral distance >5m. Relative velocity is negative longitudinally and positive laterally.
- TTC (longitudinal): 12.99m / 1.69 m/s ≈ 7.68s
- TTC (lateral): Not applicable as moving away laterally.
- MDC: Not applicable for diagonal, use individual distances.
- Risk: 5 (Negligible Risk)

Obstacle 310 (Front):
- Trajectory: Consistently front, approaching longitudinally. Lateral distance is consistently zero suggesting same lane.
- At t=2.0s: Longitudinal distance >5m. Relative velocity is negative longitudinally and positive laterally.
- TTC (longitudinal): 14.45m / 1.71 m/s ≈ 8.45s
- TTC (lateral): Not applicable.
- MDC: Use longitudinal distance.
- Risk: 5 (Negligible Risk)

Obstacle 315 (Front-Right):
- Trajectory: Consistently front-right, approaching longitudinally and moving right laterally.
- At t=2.0s: Longitudinal distance >5m, Lateral distance >5m. Relative velocity is negative longitudinally and positive laterally.
- TTC (longitudinal): 15.38m / 1.72 m/s ≈ 8.94s
- TTC (lateral): Not applicable as moving away laterally.
- MDC: Not applicable for diagonal, use individual distances.
- Risk: 5 (Negligible Risk)

Obstacle 317 (Behind):
- Trajectory: Consistently behind, approaching rapidly. Lateral distance consistently zero, same lane.
- At t=2.0s: Longitudinal distance -1.25m, very close. Relative velocity positive and high.
- TTC (longitudinal): 1.25m / 4.72 m/s ≈ 0.26s
- TTC (lateral): Not applicable.
- MDC: Use longitudinal distance 1.25m
- Risk: 1 (Extreme Risk) due to very low TTC and close proximity.

Obstacle 320 (Rear-Left):
- Trajectory: Initially directly behind, shifting slightly to the left while approaching.
- At t=2.0s: Longitudinal distance is negative but high magnitude (far). Relative velocity is positive.
- TTC (longitudinal): 20.24m / 2.31 m/s ≈ 8.76s
- TTC (lateral): Not applicable
- MDC: Use longitudinal distance.
- Risk: 5 (Negligible Risk)

Obstacle 355 (Front-Left):
- Trajectory: Consistently front-left, approaching slowly longitudinally but moving further left laterally.
- At t=2.0s: Longitudinal distance > 5m, Lateral Distance > 5m. Relative velocity is negative longitudinally, positive laterally.
- TTC (longitudinal): 16.87m / 0.1 m/s ≈ 168.7s (very high)
- TTC (lateral): Not applicable as moving away.
- MDC: Not applicable for diagonal, use individual distances.
- Risk: 5 (Negligible Risk)
