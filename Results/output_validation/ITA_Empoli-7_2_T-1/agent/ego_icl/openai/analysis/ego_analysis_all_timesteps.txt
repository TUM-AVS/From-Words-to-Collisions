To evaluate the risk of collision between the ego vehicle and the observed obstacles, I will focus on the most recent timestep provided in the context (at 2.0 seconds), while considering the developed trajectories across the previous timesteps to understand obstacle paths and predict immediate future positions. I will use the adjusted distances for more accurate assessments.

Let's analyze each obstacle at the 2.0-second mark:

### Obstacle Analysis:

#### Obstacle 31:
- **Position & Motion**: Front-left with longitudinal distance 13.04m and lateral distance 15.35m. It's driving towards the ego.
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal: -2.12 m/s, Lateral: -1.74 m/s
- **Trajectory**: Consistent approach over time.
- **TTC Calculation**:
  - Longitudinal TTC = 13.04 / 2.12 ≈ 6.15 seconds
  - Lateral is not critical due to significant distance.
- **MDC Assessment**: Both dimensions are above 5 meters.
- **Risk Score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)

#### Obstacle 35:
- **Position & Motion**: Front-right with longitudinal distance 15.11m and lateral distance -13.96m. Moving towards.
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal: -1.73 m/s, Lateral: 1.60 m/s
- **Trajectory**: Slowly closing distance.
- **TTC Calculation**: 
  - Longitudinal TTC = 15.11 / 1.73 ≈ 8.73 seconds
  - Lateral is not critical.
- **MDC Assessment**: Both dimensions are above 5 meters.
- **Risk Score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)

#### Obstacle 36:
- **Position & Motion**: Front-right with longitudinal distance 12.99m and lateral distance -13.68m. Approaching.
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal: -1.69 m/s, Lateral: 2.65 m/s
- **Trajectory**: Approaching steadily.
- **TTC Calculation**:
  - Longitudinal TTC = 12.99 / 1.69 ≈ 7.68 seconds
  - Lateral is not critical.
- **MDC Assessment**: Both dimensions are above 5 meters.
- **Risk Score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)

#### Obstacle 310:
- **Position & Motion**: Front with longitudinal distance 14.45m and lateral aligned (0.00m). Closing longitudinally.
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal: -1.71 m/s
- **Trajectory**: Consistent straight path towards ego.
- **TTC Calculation**: Longitudinal TTC = 14.45 / 1.71 ≈ 8.45 seconds
- **MDC Assessment**: Longitudinal distance is closing but remains above 5 meters.
- **Risk Score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)

#### Obstacle 315:
- **Position & Motion**: Front-right, longitudinal distance 15.38m and lateral -10.02m. Approaching.
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal: -1.72 m/s, Lateral: 1.64 m/s
- **Trajectory**: Approaching.
- **TTC Calculation**: Longitudinal TTC = 15.38 / 1.72 ≈ 8.95 seconds
- **MDC Assessment**: Both dimensions are well above 5 meters.
- **Risk Score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)

#### Obstacle 317:
- **Position & Motion**: Behind, longitudinal distance -1.25m (net positive if it was 0.00m from rear, indicating approaching alignment) and lateral aligned (0.00m).
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal: 4.72 m/s
- **Trajectory**: Approaching from behind.
- **TTC Calculation**: Since it's approaching from behind and aligned, it's critical.
  - Longitudinal TTC quickly 
  - Approaching very fast.
- **MDC Assessment**: Very small distance enhances risk.
- **Risk Score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)

#### Obstacle 320:
- **Position & Motion**: Rear-left, longitudinal distance -20.24m and lateral 0.57m.
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal: 2.31 m/s
- **Trajectory**: Approaching from behind, but at a distance.
- **TTC Calculation**: Longitudinal TTC = approaching further but from behind.
- **MDC Assessment**: Safe as lateral alignment was not absolute, and allowal signs indicated minimal risk.
- **Risk Score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)

#### Obstacle 355:
- **Position & Motion**: Front-left with longitudinal 16.87m and lateral 15.77m. Moving away laterally.
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal: -0.10 m/s, Lateral: 8.92 m/s
- **Trajectory**: Moving away quickly laterally.
- **TTC Calculation**: Increasing longitudinal, diverging path.
- **MDC Assessment**: Not a concern—large distances on both sides.
- **Risk Score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)

### Summary JSON Output:
```json
{
    "CollisionObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": null,
        "OverallRiskScore": null
    },
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "317",
        "OverallRiskScore": "1"
    },
    "HighRiskObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": null,
        "OverallRiskScore": null
    }
}
```

### Conclusion:
Obstacle 317 has been identified as presenting an "Extreme Risk" due to its proximity and rapid approach from behind. Immediate action should be taken to mitigate collision risk. All other obstacles have negligible risks at present trajectory and velocities.
