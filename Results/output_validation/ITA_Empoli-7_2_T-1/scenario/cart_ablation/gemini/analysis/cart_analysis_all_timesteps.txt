At t=2.2s, Ego (208.677, -593.0588) is in lanelet 6956. Let's analyze the closest obstacles:

* **Obstacle 317:** (213.32894, -591.91292) in lanelet 3399.  This obstacle's y-coordinate is close to Ego's and it's approaching rapidly (velocity 6.888, acceleration 1.996). Although the x-coordinate difference suggests some lateral separation, the high velocity and acceleration suggest an extremely high risk of collision within the next few timesteps if the trajectories continue on their current paths.

* **Obstacle 320:** (232.42673, -587.76347) in lanelet 3399. This obstacle is further away than 317, and although it has high velocity and acceleration,  it represents less of an immediate risk than 317. We'll classify it as a 2 or 3.

Other obstacles are significantly further away and pose less immediate risk at this timestep.
