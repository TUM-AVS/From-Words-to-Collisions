Obstacle 317 is showing a concerning trajectory. It's in a different lanelet (3399) but its position and rapidly increasing velocity (now 6.89 m/s) suggest it might be cutting into the Ego vehicle's path.  Its x-coordinate is approaching Ego's, while their y-coordinates are already close.  The accelerating trend observed over the previous timesteps reinforces this concern.

Obstacle 320 also shares lanelet 3399 with 317 and displays a similarly concerning velocity increase (now 4.54 m/s). Though its x-coordinate is further away from Ego than 317, its accelerating pattern indicates it could become a risk shortly.

        "IsCollisionScenario": false,
        "Reasoning": "Obstacle 317 poses an extreme risk due to its high velocity, accelerating trajectory, proximity to Ego, and potential lane change. Obstacle 320 is also a concern with increasing velocity."
