### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:

- Obstacle ID: 31.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 31.0 is located in a different lanelet and its y-coordinate is significantly different from the ego vehicle's, suggesting a safe lateral distance. The historical data confirms that it has remained in its lane.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: The obstacle's velocity is lower than the ego vehicle's, and the historical data shows no indication of rapid acceleration or trajectory changes.  
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 35.0
- Distance Risk reason:  Obstacle 35.0 is in a different lanelet and its y-coordinate shows a safe lateral separation from the ego vehicle.  The history confirms it is remaining in its lane.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: The obstacle's velocity and acceleration pose no immediate threat based on the current trajectory and historical data.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 36.0
- Distance Risk reason: Similar to 35.0, Obstacle 36.0 is also in a different lanelet with a safe lateral separation.  Its trajectory history supports this.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Although its velocity is slightly higher than the ego vehicle's, the lane separation mitigates the risk. The historical data doesn't show any concerning trajectory changes.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 310.0
- Distance Risk reason: While in the same lanelet as some other obstacles, Obstacle 310.0 maintains a safe distance from the ego vehicle in the most recent timestep.  Reviewing the history, it appears to be approaching the ego vehicle but remains at a safe distance.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: The obstacle's velocity is lower than the ego vehicle's and its acceleration is moderate.  Historical data reinforces this assessment.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- Obstacle ID: 315.0
- Distance Risk reason: Similar to 35.0 and 36.0, Obstacle 315.0 is in a different lanelet with safe lateral separation according to the latest timestep and trajectory history.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason:  Velocity and acceleration do not pose a threat given the lateral separation and the observed historical trajectory.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 317.0
- Distance Risk reason:  Obstacle 317.0 is in a different lanelet and further ahead of the ego vehicle at the last timestep.  Analyzing the history, it appears to be moving away and is not a concern.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Its high velocity is not a direct threat due to its position ahead of the ego vehicle and movement in a different lanelet. The history indicates this is a sustained trend.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 320.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 320.0 is also further ahead of the ego vehicle and in a different lanelet at the most recent timestep. The historical data indicates it's maintaining its distance.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Similar to 317.0, the high velocity isn't a threat due to lane separation and longitudinal position.  History shows a consistent trend.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 355.0
- Distance Risk reason: While initially in a different lanelet, Obstacle 355.0's y-coordinate at the most recent timestep and the trend over the last few steps show a rapid approach towards the ego vehicle's y-coordinate and poses a high collision risk.
- Distance safety score: 2
- Time Risk reason:  The very high velocity and non-zero acceleration of this obstacle, combined with the lateral movement towards the ego vehicle's lane based on the trajectory history, significantly increase the risk.
- Time safety score: 2
- Overall Risk score: 2



### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. **Most critical obstacle:** Obstacle 355.0 poses the highest risk due to its high velocity, acceleration towards the ego vehicle's y-coordinate, and its decreasing lateral separation.
2. **Trajectory analysis:** Over the 10 timesteps, 355.0 consistently moves with a high velocity and a changing y-coordinate, indicating a potential lane change or a trajectory that intersects with the ego vehicle's path.
3. **Relative position, velocity, and acceleration:** Obstacle 355.0's rapid approach, combined with its high velocity, creates a high-risk situation.
4. **Collision determination:** Although a collision hasn't occurred within these 10 timesteps, the current trajectory and dynamics suggest a high likelihood of a future collision if no evasive action is taken.
5. **Reasoning:** The combination of high velocity, decreasing lateral distance, and accelerating trajectory of obstacle 355.0 leads to the conclusion that this is a potential collision scenario.
