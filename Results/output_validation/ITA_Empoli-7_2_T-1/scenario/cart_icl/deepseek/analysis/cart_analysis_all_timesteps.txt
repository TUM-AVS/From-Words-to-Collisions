10. **Obstacle ID: 357.0**
    - **Distance Risk Reason**: Moving away in X-direction (~28.5m behind ego).
    - **Distance Safety Score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
    - **Time Risk Reason**: High velocity (10.42 m/s) but diverging paths.
    - **Time Safety Score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
    - **Overall Risk Score**: 5

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. **Obstacle 317.0** is the most critical with high risk (score 2) due to rapid approach from front-left.
2. No obstacles are in immediate collision path (score 0) or extreme risk (score 1).
3. All other obstacles are either moving away or have sufficient distance/time buffers.
4. Ego maintains steady velocity and orientation, with no sudden maneuvers needed.
