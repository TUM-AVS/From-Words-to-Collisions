- Obstacle ID: 315.0
- Distance Risk reason: Laterally separated from ego. No immediate risk.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: No immediate time-based risk due to distance and differing trajectories.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 317.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is in a different lanelet and moving away, though initially closer.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Relative speed is significant, but divergence in trajectories reduces risk.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- Obstacle ID: 320.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is in a different lanelet and maintaining separation.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Relative speed is moderate, but trajectories diverge, reducing risk.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- Obstacle ID: 355.0
- Distance Risk reason: Initially close but laterally separated and moving away rapidly.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: High speed, but moving away from the ego vehicle quickly mitigating risk.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4



### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
No obstacles are on a direct collision course with the ego vehicle.  Lateral separation and diverging trajectories are observed for all obstacles across the provided timesteps. Though some obstacles have higher relative speeds, their movement patterns do not indicate an immediate collision risk.
