   - **Time safety score**: 4
   - **Overall Risk score**: 4

6. **Obstacle ID: 317.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Heading towards a similar direction but at a safe distance, keeping parallel without intersection risk.
   - **Distance safety score**: 4
   - **Time Risk reason**: High speed but consistent on a parallel path; no indicators of rapid divergence from a safe trajectory.
   - **Time safety score**: 4
   - **Overall Risk score**: 4

7. **Obstacle ID: 320.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Maintains a direct but separate trajectory from the ego, ensuring lateral clearance.
   - **Distance safety score**: 4
   - **Time Risk reason**: Higher velocity but on a non-intersecting path; stable overall trajectory.
   - **Time safety score**: 4
   - **Overall Risk score**: 4

8. **Obstacle ID: 355.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: High velocity but positioned laterally far from the ego vehicle; no projected crossing paths.
   - **Distance safety score**: 3
   - **Time Risk reason**: Speed suggests an ability to rapidly change conditions, though current trajectory remains steady.
   - **Time safety score**: 3
   - **Overall Risk score**: 3

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
- After reviewing the trajectory and position of obstacles relative to the ego vehicle, it is evident that none are on an immediate collision path. The observed consistent patterns in speed and lane usage further mitigate risk.
