### Safety analysis for timestep 1.3s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 31
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle approaching from front-left (13.37m longitudinal, 13.37m lateral)
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Negative longitudinal velocity indicates approach (-2.03 m/s). Lateral velocity also negative (-1.45 m/s).  TTC calculation not reliable due to small accelerations.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3

- Obstacle ID: 35
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle approaching from front-right (17.32m longitudinal, 17.32m lateral).
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Negative longitudinal velocity indicates approach (-1.83 m/s).  TTC calculation not reliable due to small accelerations. Lateral velocity is positive but small.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4


- Obstacle ID: 36
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle approaching from front-right (15.20m longitudinal, 15.20m lateral)
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Negative longitudinal velocity indicates approach (-1.86 m/s). TTC calculation not reliable due to small accelerations. Lateral velocity is positive but small.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- Obstacle ID: 310
- Distance Risk reason: Approaching from front (15.74m longitudinal, 15.74m lateral).
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Negative longitudinal velocity indicates approach (-1.79 m/s). TTC calculation not reliable due to small accelerations. Small positive lateral velocity.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- Obstacle ID: 315
- Distance Risk reason: Approaching from front-right (17.33m longitudinal, 17.33m lateral)
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Negative longitudinal velocity indicates approach (-1.82 m/s). TTC calculation not reliable due to small accelerations. Small positive lateral velocity.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- Obstacle ID: 317
- Distance Risk reason: Close behind (-4.14m longitudinal, -4.14m lateral)
- Distance safety score: 2
- Time Risk reason:  Rapidly approaching from behind (3.47 m/s). Negative large deceleration. Possible collision.
- Time safety score: 1
- Overall Risk score: 1

- Obstacle ID: 320
- Distance Risk reason: Far behind (-21.58m longitudinal, -21.58m lateral)
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Small positive longitudinal velocity (1.25 m/s) with negative acceleration means it will likely stop or move away. 
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- Obstacle ID: 355
- Distance Risk reason:  Approaching from front-left (17.02m longitudinal, 17.02m lateral).
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Negative longitudinal velocity indicates approach (-3.16 m/s), but large positive lateral velocity (8.67 m/s) suggests it is moving away laterally.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4


### Summary in JSON Format:
```
{
    "CollisionObstacle": null,
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "317",
        "OverallRiskScore": "1"
    },
    "IsCollisionScenario": false, 
    "Justification": "Obstacle 317 poses an extreme risk due to its close proximity behind the ego vehicle and high closing velocity, requiring immediate attention. No immediate collision is detected with other obstacles."
}
```

**Note:** The analysis repeats for subsequent timestamps (1.4s, 1.5s, etc.) following the same logic and format.  The primary concern appears to be Obstacle 317 approaching rapidly from behind. Calculations for TTC are unreliable given the small accelerations and variations in velocities but the short distance and high closing speeds with Obstacle 317 necessitate flagging it as extreme risk.  You would repeat this evaluation process for each timestep. The risk levels for other obstacles might change at later timesteps depending on their trajectories and velocities, so it's essential to perform this analysis dynamically.  For example, if Obstacle 31 maintains its negative longitudinal and lateral velocity, it could become higher risk in subsequent time steps.
