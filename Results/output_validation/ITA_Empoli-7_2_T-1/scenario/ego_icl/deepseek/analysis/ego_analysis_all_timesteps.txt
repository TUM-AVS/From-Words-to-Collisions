Let me analyze each obstacle at the most recent timestep (2.2 seconds) with trajectory context:

1. Obstacle 31 (Front-left):
   - Adjusted distances: long=12.61m, lat=15.00m
   - Velocities: long=-2.13m/s (approaching), lat=-1.82m/s (approaching)
   - TTC_long = 12.61/2.13 = 5.92s
   - TTC_lat = 15.00/1.82 = 8.24s
   - MDC: Both distances large (>5m)
   - Risk: 5 (No Risk) - Diverging laterally over time

2. Obstacle 35 (Front-right):
   - Adjusted distances: long=14.77m, lat=-13.63m
   - Velocities: long=-1.73m/s, lat=1.65m/s
   - TTC_long = 14.77/1.73 = 8.54s
   - TTC_lat = 13.63/1.65 = 8.26s
   - MDC: Both distances large (>5m)
   - Risk: 5 (No Risk)

3. Obstacle 36 (Front-right):
   - Adjusted distances: long=12.66m, lat=-13.14m
   - Velocities: long=-1.68m/s, lat=2.70m/s
   - TTC_long = 12.66/1.68 = 7.54s
   - TTC_lat = 13.14/2.70 = 4.87s
   - MDC: Both distances >5m
   - Risk: 5 (No Risk)

4. Obstacle 310 (Front):
   - Adjusted distances: long=14.11m, lat=0.00m
   - Velocities: long=-1.70m/s, lat=1.36m/s
   - TTC_long = 14.11/1.70 = 8.30s
   - MDC: Longitudinal distance >5m
   - Risk: 5 (No Risk) - Lateral alignment but no convergence

5. Obstacle 315 (Front-right):
   - Adjusted distances: long=15.04m, lat=-9.67m
   - Velocities: long=-1.71m/s, lat=1.72m/s
   - TTC_long = 15.04/1.71 = 8.80s
   - TTC_lat = 9.67/1.72 = 5.62s
   - MDC: Both distances >5m
   - Risk: 5 (No Risk)

6. Obstacle 317 (Behind) - CRITICAL:
   - Adjusted distances: long=-0.27m, lat=0.00m
   - Velocities: long=5.06m/s (approaching fast), lat=-0.62m/s
   - TTC_long = 0.27/5.06 = 0.053s (53ms)
   - MDC: Longitudinal distance <0.5m with high closing speed
   - Risk: 1 (Extreme Risk) - Imminent rear collision

7. Obstacle 320 (Rear-left):
   - Adjusted distances: long=-19.74m, lat=0.48m
   - Velocities: long=2.72m/s, lat=-0.41m/s
   - TTC_long = 19.74/2.72 = 7.26s
   - MDC: Longitudinal distance >5m
   - Risk: 5 (No Risk)

8. Obstacle 355 (Front-left):
   - Adjusted distances: long=16.86m, lat=17.57m
   - Velocities: long=0.28m/s (moving away), lat=9.00m/s (moving away)
   - Risk: 5 (No Risk) - Diverging in both dimensions

Trajectory Analysis:
- Obstacle 317 shows dangerous rear approach pattern:
  - At 1.7s: long=-2.60m
  - At 1.9s: long=-1.72m
  - At 2.0s: long=-1.25m
  - At 2.1s: long=-0.77m
  - At 2.2s: long=-0.27m
- Constant high approach speed (~5m/s) with acceleration
- Now within 0.27m longitudinally (effectively touching)
