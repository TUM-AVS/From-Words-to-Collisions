- Overall Time Safety Score: 4.5
- Overall Risk Score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 35
- Relative Direction: Front-right
- Distance Risk Reason:  Longitudinal distance is large, lateral distance is medium, indicating overall low risk. History shows it is slowly approaching.
- Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 5
- Lateral Distance Safety Score: 5
- Overall Distance Safety Score: 5.0
- Time Risk Reason: Both TTCs are high and safe based on history
- Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 5
- Lateral Time Safety Score: 5
- Overall Time Safety Score: 5.0
- Overall Risk Score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 36
- Relative Direction: Front-right
- Distance Risk Reason: Longitudinal distance is safe, lateral distance is medium. History shows it is slowly approaching.
- Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 5
- Lateral Distance Safety Score: 5
- Overall Distance Safety Score: 5.0
- Time Risk Reason: Longitudinal TTC is safe, lateral TTC is medium but not immediately concerning based on history
- Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 5
- Lateral Time Safety Score: 4
- Overall Time Safety Score: 4.5
- Overall Risk Score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 310
- Relative Direction: Front
- Distance Risk Reason:  Longitudinal distance is large, lateral distance is zero meaning aligned longitudinally, history confirms consistent approach.
- Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 5
- Lateral Distance Safety Score: 5
- Overall Distance Safety Score: 5.0
- Time Risk Reason: Longitudinal TTC is safe, lateral TTC is zero as expected.
- Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 5
- Lateral Time Safety Score: 5
- Overall Time Safety Score: 5.0
- Overall Risk Score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 315
- Relative Direction: Front-right
- Distance Risk Reason:  Longitudinal and lateral distances both suggest low risk, consistent with history.
- Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 5
- Lateral Distance Safety Score: 5
- Overall Distance Safety Score: 5.0
- Time Risk Reason: Both TTC values suggest low risk.
- Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 5
- Lateral Time Safety Score: 5
- Overall Time Safety Score: 5.0
- Overall Risk Score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 317
- Relative Direction: Behind
- Distance Risk Reason: Longitudinal distance is extremely close and negative, suggesting a potential collision. This is worsening in the history.
- Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 0
- Lateral Distance Safety Score: 5
- Overall Distance Safety Score: 0.0
- Time Risk Reason:  Longitudinal TTC is extremely small, and the trend over time confirms high risk.  Lateral TTC is zero, confirming no lateral movement.
- Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 0
- Lateral Time Safety Score: 5
- Overall Time Safety Score: 0.0
- Overall Risk Score: 0

- Obstacle ID: 320
- Relative Direction: Rear-left
- Distance Risk Reason:  Large negative longitudinal distance indicates the obstacle is behind the ego vehicle. Small positive lateral distance confirms the "rear-left" categorization.  History shows it approaching but still at a safe distance.
- Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 5
- Lateral Distance Safety Score: 5
- Overall Distance Safety Score: 5
- Time Risk Reason:  Longitudinal TTC is large, lateral TTC is very small. 
- Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 5
- Lateral Time Safety Score: 5
- Overall Time Safety Score: 5
- Overall Risk Score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 355
- Relative Direction: Front-left
- Distance Risk Reason: Large longitudinal and lateral distances indicate low risk, improving based on history.
- Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 5
- Lateral Distance Safety Score: 5
- Overall Distance Safety Score: 5.0
- Time Risk Reason:  Both longitudinal and lateral TTC show no collision risk.
- Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 5
- Lateral Time Safety Score: 5
- Overall Time Safety Score: 5.0
- Overall Risk Score: 5
