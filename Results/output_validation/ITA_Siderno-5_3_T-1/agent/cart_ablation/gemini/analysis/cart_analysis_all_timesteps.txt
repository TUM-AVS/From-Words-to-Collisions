Here's the collision risk analysis:

**Obstacle 344:** This obstacle is in the same lane as the ego vehicle and its y-coordinate is decreasing faster than the ego vehicle's y-coordinate.  Although the distance between the vehicles is decreasing and obstacle 344 has a higher velocity, it doesn't pose an immediate collision risk within the timeframe of provided data. Risk score: 3 (Medium risk)

**Obstacle 355:** This obstacle is in a different lane and its y-coordinate is initially significantly lower than the ego vehicle. While the distance between them decreases slightly, there's no immediate collision risk. Risk score: 4 (Low risk)

**Obstacle 359:** This obstacle is initially in a different lane but changes to the ego vehicle's lane between timesteps 1.8 and 1.9 seconds, which is also the ego vehicle's new lane as of the timestep at 1.9 seconds.  It poses a potential future risk as its y-coordinate is decreasing faster than the ego vehicle and they are now in the same lane. Risk score: 2 (High Risk).

**Obstacle 312:** This obstacle appears at timestep 1.5 seconds and remains stationary in a different lane, far from the ego vehicle. It poses no risk. Risk score: 5 (Negligible risk)

**Predicted Extreme Risk**: Obstacle 359 poses a high risk. Given its current trajectory and higher velocity, it will likely pose an *extreme risk* in the very near future if both it and the ego vehicle maintain their course and velocity.
