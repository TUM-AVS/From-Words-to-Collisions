Obstacle 344: This obstacle is in the same lane as the ego vehicle and is approaching from behind at a higher speed.  While the distance is currently significant, the closing speed is high, posing a potential future risk if the ego vehicle were to decelerate suddenly or the obstacle continues to accelerate.  For now, the risk is low given the separation.

Obstacle 355: This obstacle is in a different lanelet and its trajectory doesn't appear to intersect with the ego vehicle's path in the near future. The risk is negligible.

Obstacle 359: This obstacle is also in a different lanelet. Although it shares a lanelet with the ego vehicle briefly in the future timestamps, the positions and trajectories suggest they won't be in close proximity at the same time. The risk is negligible.

Obstacle 312: This obstacle is static and located in a different lanelet. It poses no immediate risk.
