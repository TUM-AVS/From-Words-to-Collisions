Obstacle 344 is showing concerning behavior. It's in the same lane as the ego vehicle and accelerating towards it.  While not immediately colliding, the continuous acceleration and high velocity of 344, combined with the ego vehicle's much slower speed, suggest a possible very high risk situation developing. More data points would give better insight into the development of the situation. Obstacle 359, while also accelerating, it is in a different lanelet and not posing an immediate threat. Obstacles 312 and 355 appear static and/or are far enough away to be of low risk.
