### Analysis:

- **Obstacle 344.0**: This obstacle is on the same lanelet as the Ego vehicle and is rapidly closing the distance with high velocity and significant acceleration. By observing the trajectory across the timesteps, obstacle 344.0 progresses in a trajectory that aligns closely with the Ego, indicating a potential for imminent collision. Hence, this obstacle is assessed as **Extreme Risk (score 1)** due to its accelerating approach within the same lanelet, indicating a high likelihood of collision unless the Ego performs evasive maneuvers immediately.

- **Obstacle 359.0**: Although located in a different lanelet initially and maintaining some distance, this obstacle's trajectory shows significant velocity and acceleration that closes the gap towards a possible collision path. While not as urgent as 344.0, it poses a **High Risk (score 2)** due to the faster approach and reduced time to react.

Both these obstacles should be closely monitored, and preventative measures should be considered to mitigate any potential collision risks.
