Obstacle 344 is in the same lane as the ego vehicle and rapidly approaching from behind.  At the last timestep (2.2s), it is only about 26 meters behind the ego and closing quickly with a speed difference of roughly 5 m/s. This represents a high risk of collision if the ego vehicle does not react appropriately. If this trend continues, a collision is likely.

Obstacle 359 is in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle at the most recent timestep. While it is ahead of the ego vehicle, it is moving slower, leading to the ego vehicle closing the distance. Continuous monitoring is required, but immediate intervention is not necessary yet.
