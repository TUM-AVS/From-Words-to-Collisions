To address the scenario, we need to evaluate the relative motion of each obstacle concerning the Ego vehicle at the most recent timestep (2.2 seconds) and determine the risk level based on their positions, velocities, and orientations. 

### Step-by-Step Risk Analysis for Each Obstacle:

**Obstacle 312.0:**  
- **Distance from Ego:** Approximately ((98.95 - 70.40)^2 + (-890.17 + 895.03)^2)^0.5 = 28.5 meters.
- **Velocity:** 0.0 (stationary).
- **Lanelet Difference:** Different lanelet and stationary.
- **Risk Assessment:** **Negligible Risk (5)**

**Obstacle 344.0:**  
- **Distance from Ego:** Approximately ((65.87 - 70.40)^2 + (-891.86 + 895.03)^2)^0.5 = 4.4 meters.
- **Relative Longitudinal Position and Velocity:** The vehicle is approaching slightly, same lanelet.
- **MDC Calculation:** Lateral offset is minor, indicating closeness but not at an immediate collision risk at current trajectory.
- **Risk Assessment:** **Medium Risk (3)**

**Obstacle 355.0:**  
- **Distance from Ego:** Approximately ((71.94 - 70.40)^2 + (-916.27 + 895.03)^2)^0.5 = 21.5 meters.
- **Lanelet Difference:** Different lanelet.
- **Relative Heading:** Trajectory indicates a parallel approach to different lanes with increasing distance.
- **Risk Assessment:** **Low Risk (4)**

**Obstacle 359.0:**  
- **Distance from Ego:** Approximately ((75.70 - 70.40)^2 + (-905.24 + 895.03)^2)^0.5 = 10.3 meters.
- **Relative Driving Position:** Same lanelet, moving along a similar trajectory.
- **MDC and TTC Insight:** Calculations show the trajectory and relative velocity place it on a converging path with Ego, but not immediacy for a collision given distance.
- **Risk Assessment:** **Medium Risk (3)**

### Summary and Structured JSON Output

```json
{
    "CollisionObstacles": [],
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {},
    "HighRiskObstacle": {}
}
```

- **No Collision^ (0) or Extreme Risks (1)** present in the immediate timestep analyzed.
- **Medium Risk (3):** Obstacle 344.0 and 359.0 hold medium risk due to their proximity and parallel movement in the same lanelet.
- For better refinement, consider reanalysis with the upstream trajectory projection for potential convergence.
