At t=2.2s, Obstacle 344 poses an extreme risk of collision. It is very close to the ego vehicle (-0.68m longitudinally and -0.29m laterally) and approaching rapidly from the rear-right. The closing velocity and proximity suggest a high probability of collision within the next time step if the current trajectories are maintained.  Obstacle 312, while relatively close longitudinally (7.86m), is moving away laterally and does not pose an immediate threat. Obstacles 355 and 359 are moving away from the ego vehicle and pose no immediate risk.
