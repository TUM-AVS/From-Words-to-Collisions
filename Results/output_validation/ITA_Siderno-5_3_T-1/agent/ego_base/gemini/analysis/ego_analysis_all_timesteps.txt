At t=2.2s:
- **Obstacle 312:** Located Front-left, longitudinal distance 7.86m, lateral distance 24.58m, and moving towards the ego vehicle longitudinally at -2.57 m/s, no lateral movement. This obstacle poses no immediate threat and has a low risk (4 or 5).

- **Obstacle 344:** Located Rear-right, longitudinal distance -0.68m, lateral distance -0.29m, and approaching rapidly from behind at 4.99 m/s longitudinally and 1.72 m/s laterally.  This is extremely close and represents an **extreme risk (1)** of collision.

- **Obstacle 355:** Located Front-right, longitudinal distance 13.79m, lateral distance -9.29m, moving towards the ego longitudinally at -0.83 m/s while moving away laterally.  This obstacle has a low risk (4 or 5).

- **Obstacle 359:** Located in Front, longitudinal distance 6.90m, no lateral distance, moving away longitudinally at 3.84 m/s.  This obstacle poses no immediate threat and has a low risk (4 or 5).


Risk Levels:
0: Collision - Physical contact occurred or unavoidable
1: Extreme Risk - Immediate collision likely
2: High Risk - Close to collision, needs quick action
3: Medium Risk - Manageable with proper reaction
4: Low Risk - Minimal risk, sufficient time to react
5: Negligible Risk - No significant risk
