### Safety analysis for timestep 2.2s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

**Assumptions and Calculations:**

* To calculate TTC (Time-to-Collision), we'll use the following formula: TTC = Distance / Relative Velocity.  If the relative velocity is positive (moving away), TTC will be positive. If the relative velocity is negative (moving closer), TTC will be negative indicating time until collision. For MDC values I considered size of ego and obstacle vehicle with margin distance. I set the MDC limit value to 0.5m which means if the minimum projected distance between two vehicle is less than 0.5 meters then it is Extreme risk (1). If the minimum projected distance is 0 meter it means there is already a Collision (0).

* Since the provided scenario doesn't directly give us adjusted distance (vehicle size and shape are not defined), we will use the provided real distances as approximations for our calculations. In a real-world application, these adjustments are crucial.


**General Observations:**

* Obstacle 344 poses the most immediate risk, rapidly approaching the ego vehicle from behind. The negative distance indicates it's already very close.
* Obstacles 355 and 359 are moving away from the ego vehicle longitudinally and laterally and are at low risk although Obstacle 355 shows closing longitudinally with low speed.
* Obstacle 312, while at 7.86m longitudinal distance, has a negative relative velocity meaning closing with moderate speed toward ego vehicle and will require monitoring.


### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID:** 312
- Distance Risk reason:  7.86m longitudinally and 7.86m laterally distant is safe.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason:  Closing in longitudinally with -2.57 m/s. TTC approximately around 3 sec. No lateral movement.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3

- **Obstacle ID:** 344
- Distance Risk reason: -0.68m longitudinally and -0.68 m laterally indicates an extremely close proximity from behind, nearly a collision if we consider vehicle size, shape and other factors.
- Distance safety score: 1
- Time Risk reason: Approaching rapidly at 4.99 m/s longitudinally and 1.72 m/s laterally. TTC is near zero, indicating imminent collision.
- Time safety score: 1
- Overall Risk score: 1

- **Obstacle ID:** 355
- Distance Risk reason:  13.79m longitudinally and 13.79m laterally is safe.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Slightly closing speed longitudinally with -0.83 m/s. Moving away laterally.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- **Obstacle ID:** 359
- Distance Risk reason: 6.9m longitudinally and 6.9m laterally is safe.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Moving away at 3.84 m/s longitudinally. Moving away laterally with -3.27 m/s.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5
