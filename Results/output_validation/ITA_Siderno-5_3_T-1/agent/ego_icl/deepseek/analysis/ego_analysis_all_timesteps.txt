Let me analyze the most recent timestep (2.2 seconds) and assess collision risks for each obstacle:

1. Obstacle 312 (Front-left):
- Longitudinal distance: 7.86m (moving closer at -2.57m/s)
- Lateral distance: 24.58m (stable)
- TTC: 7.86/2.57 = 3.06s (Medium Risk)
- MDC: Lateral distance is large (24.58m) - No Risk
- Overall: Medium Risk (3) - moving closer but large lateral separation

2. Obstacle 344 (Rear-right):
- Longitudinal distance: -0.68m (approaching at 4.99m/s)
- Lateral distance: -0.29m (approaching at 1.72m/s)
- TTC longitudinal: 0.68/4.99 = 0.136s (Extreme Risk)
- TTC lateral: 0.29/1.72 = 0.169s (Extreme Risk)
- MDC: Both distances < 0.5m (Extreme Risk)
- Overall: Extreme Risk (1) - imminent collision from rear-right

3. Obstacle 355 (Front-right):
- Longitudinal distance: 13.79m (approaching at -0.83m/s)
- Lateral distance: -9.29m (moving away at -5.96m/s)
- TTC: Not applicable (lateral distance increasing)
- MDC: Large distances - No Risk (5)
- Overall: No Risk (5) - moving away in both dimensions

4. Obstacle 359 (Front):
- Longitudinal distance: 6.90m (moving away at 3.84m/s)
- Lateral distance: 0.00m (moving away at -3.27m/s)
- TTC: Not applicable (moving away)
- MDC: Large distance - No Risk (5)
- Overall: No Risk (5) - moving away

Trajectory Analysis:
- Obstacle 344 shows consistent approach from rear-right with increasing speed
- At current rate, will collide with ego vehicle in next 0.1-0.2s
- Other obstacles either moving away or have safe distances
