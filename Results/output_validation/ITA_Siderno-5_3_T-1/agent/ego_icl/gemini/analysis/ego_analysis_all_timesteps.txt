* **Obstacle 312 (Front-Left):**  This obstacle is primarily to the front-left, and its longitudinal distance is decreasing while the lateral distance remains relatively stable across the provided timesteps. At the last timestep, the longitudinal distance is 7.86m and the lateral distance is 24.58m. The relative longitudinal velocity is -2.57 m/s.  TTC (longitudinal) = 7.86m / 2.57 m/s ≈ 3.06s.  MDC is primarily determined by the longitudinal distance in this case and is approximately 7.86m. The risk level for this obstacle is **Medium (3)**.

* **Obstacle 344 (Rear-Right):** This obstacle poses the most immediate risk. It is approaching rapidly from behind and slightly to the right. The longitudinal distance is -0.68m, meaning it's very close behind, and the lateral distance is -0.29m, slightly to the right. The relative longitudinal velocity is 4.99 m/s indicating a fast approach. TTC (longitudinal) = 0.68m / 4.99m/s ≈ 0.14s. MDC is approximately 0.68m. This indicates an **Extreme Risk (1)** of collision.

* **Obstacle 355 (Front-Right):**  This obstacle is moving away laterally and slightly towards the ego vehicle longitudinally. At the last timestep, the longitudinal distance is 13.79m and lateral distance -9.29m. The relative longitudinal velocity is -0.83 m/s, and the lateral velocity is -5.96 m/s. TTC (longitudinal) = 13.79 / 0.83 ≈ 16.61s. TTC (lateral) = 9.29 / 5.96 ≈ 1.56s. MDC is approximately 13.79m, primarily governed by the longitudinal distance.  This suggests a **Low (4)** risk.

* **Obstacle 359 (Front):**  This obstacle is directly in front and moving away from the ego vehicle longitudinally.  At the last timestep, the longitudinal distance is 6.90m and lateral distance is 0.00m. The relative longitudinal velocity is 3.84 m/s.  TTC = 6.90 / 3.84 ≈ 1.79s.  MDC is approximately 6.90m, governed by the longitudinal distance. This indicates a **Medium (3)** risk level.
