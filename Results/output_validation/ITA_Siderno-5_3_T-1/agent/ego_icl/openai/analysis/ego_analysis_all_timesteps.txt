### Obstacle-by-Obstacle Analysis:

#### Obstacle 312 - Front-left
- **Adjusted Distances**: Longitudinal: 7.86m, Lateral: 24.58m
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal: -2.57 m/s
- **Trajectory**: Approaching longitudinally, no lateral motion
- **TTC Calculation**: |7.86 / 2.57| ≈ 3.06 seconds (longitudinal)
- **MDC Calculation**: Considering constant path, MDC ≈ 7.86 meters due to no lateral closure
- **Risk Assessment**: With a TTC of around 3.06s and MDC > 5.0m, this obstacle poses a low risk. **Risk Level: 4**

#### Obstacle 344 - Rear-right
- **Adjusted Distances**: Longitudinal: -0.68m, Lateral: -0.29m
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal: 4.99 m/s, Lateral: 1.72 m/s
- **Trajectory**: Approaching from rear-right, both dimensions converging
- **TTC Calculation**: |0.68 / 4.99| ≈ 0.14 seconds (longitudinal), |0.29 / 1.72| ≈ 0.17 seconds (lateral)
- **MDC Calculation**: Critical as the approach is nearly aligned longitudinally and laterally. MDC ≈ 0 meters if trajectories hold.
- **Risk Assessment**: Extreme collision risk due to converging paths in all dimensions and very low TTC. **Risk Level: 1**

#### Obstacle 355 - Front-right
- **Adjusted Distances**: Longitudinal: 13.79m, Lateral: -9.29m
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal: -0.83 m/s, Lateral: -5.96 m/s
- **Trajectory**: Approaching longitudinally, moving away laterally
- **TTC Calculation**: Not prone to collision due to lateral movement away 
- **MDC Calculation**: Estimation above 5m due to diverging paths laterally
- **Risk Assessment**: With paths diverging laterally and high MDC, this obstacle poses no significant risk. **Risk Level: 5**

#### Obstacle 359 - Front
- **Adjusted Distances**: Longitudinal: 6.90m, Lateral: 0.00m
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal: 3.84 m/s
- **Trajectory**: Moving away, maintaining exact lateral alignment
- **TTC Calculation**: |6.90 / 3.84| ≈ 1.80 seconds (longitudinal)
- **MDC Calculation**: As it moves away, risk is reduced, MDC ≈ 6.90 m
- **Risk Assessment**: Medium risk due to moving away longitudinally, with a decent TTC. **Risk Level: 3**

### Trajectory Analysis across Timesteps
- **Obstacle 312** is consistently approaching longitudinally but is well beyond immediate risk at >5m MDC.
- **Obstacle 344** follows a consistent closure path longitudinally and laterally, indicating an imminent collision risk if unchecked.
- **Obstacle 355** is consistently moving away laterally, posing negligible or no risk.
- **Obstacle 359** is moving slightly longitudinally away, maintaining lateral alignment, with a substantial MDC.
