Obstacle 344 is in the same lane as the ego vehicle and rapidly approaching from behind.  At the last timestep (2.4s), Obstacle 344 is less than 3 meters behind the ego vehicle and traveling ~5.6 m/s faster. Given the closing velocity and proximity, a collision is highly likely in the next few moments if the ego vehicle does not react.

Obstacle 359 is in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle at the final timestep. Although it is ahead of the ego vehicle, its lateral position is very close, suggesting a possible lane change maneuver by the ego vehicle which puts them on a collision course. The closing velocity is also quite high. This represents an extreme risk.

    "IsCollisionScenario": false,
    "Reasoning": "Obstacle 344 poses an extreme risk due to its high closing velocity from behind and close proximity to the ego vehicle in the same lane. Obstacle 359 also poses an extreme risk due to close proximity and high closing velocity after ego vehicle's lane change. No immediate collision detected."
