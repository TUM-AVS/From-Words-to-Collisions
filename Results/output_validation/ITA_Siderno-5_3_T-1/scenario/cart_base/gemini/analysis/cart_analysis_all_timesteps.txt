Obstacle 344 is in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle and is rapidly approaching from behind.  At the last timestep (2.4s), Obstacle 344 is only ~22 meters behind the ego vehicle and traveling ~5.5 m/s faster. Given the closing speed and relatively short distance, a collision is highly likely in the next few seconds if the ego vehicle does not react. Obstacle 359 is in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle at the final timestep. While the distance between them is greater than with obstacle 344, obstacle 359 is also traveling much faster than the ego vehicle. The rapid lane change of the ego vehicle combined with the speed differential creates a high risk of collision with obstacle 359.
