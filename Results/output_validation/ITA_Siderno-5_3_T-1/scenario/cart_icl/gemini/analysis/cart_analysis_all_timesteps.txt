### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 312.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is far from ego and in a different lanelet. No risk observed in the provided timesteps.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Obstacle is stationary.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 344.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is in the same lanelet as ego and rapidly approaching from behind.  The distance is decreasing over time.
- Distance safety score: 2
- Time Risk reason:  High closing velocity indicates high risk of collision in the near future.
- Time safety score: 2
- Overall Risk score: 2

- Obstacle ID: 355.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is in a different lanelet and poses no immediate threat based on current trajectories.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason:  Lateral velocity and distance suggest low risk.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- Obstacle ID: 359.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle and the distance is decreasing, posing a potential risk.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: Although the obstacle is moving faster than the ego vehicle, the rate of closure is moderate.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
This is not a collision scenario. While obstacle 344 poses a high risk, it has not yet collided with the ego vehicle. No obstacle has a risk score of 0.
