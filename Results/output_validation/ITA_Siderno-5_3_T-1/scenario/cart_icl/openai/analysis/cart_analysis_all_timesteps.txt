### Obstacle Analysis for Most Recent Timestep:

#### Obstacle ID: 312.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: Maintains a stationary position throughout the observations. The position is far from the ego vehicle, suggesting no immediate threat.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: Velocity and acceleration are both zero; unlikely to pose a risk given the lack of movement.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 344.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: Located in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle. The trajectory indicates that it's moving toward the position where the ego vehicle is heading, but currently still at a sufficient distance.
- **Distance safety score**: 3
- **Time Risk reason**: Shows consistent speed increase moving towards the ego's trajectory. A moderate risk since the vehicle is accelerating.
- **Time safety score**: 3
- **Overall Risk score**: 3

#### Obstacle ID: 355.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: Positioned on a different lanelet; moving consistently away from the lanelet of the ego vehicle.
- **Distance safety score**: 4
- **Time Risk reason**: Although it moves at a moderate pace, its trajectory seems not to intersect with the ego vehicle's path.
- **Time safety score**: 4
- **Overall Risk score**: 4

#### Obstacle ID: 359.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: Initially positioned in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle starting at 1.9 seconds. Shows proximity to the ego's trajectory with increasing velocity.
- **Distance safety score**: 2
- **Time Risk reason**: Continues to accelerate and is on a potential collision path with the ego vehicle due to trajectory overlap.
- **Time safety score**: 2
- **Overall Risk score**: 2

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
- **Collision Assessment**: There are no obstacles in immediate collision course (risk score 0). Obstacle 359.0 poses a high risk due to its trajectory and increasing speed, but it is not at an extreme collision risk.
- **Conclusion**: This is not an immediate collision scenario. However, Obstacle 359.0 presents the most significant risk, requiring proactive mitigating actions by the ego vehicle.
