Obstacle 344 poses an extreme risk to the ego vehicle. At t=2.4s, it is almost alongside the ego vehicle (0.00 m longitudinal, -0.17 m lateral) and moving towards the ego laterally.  The small lateral distance and the movement towards the ego, despite the longitudinal movement, indicates a very high probability of collision in the next timestep.
