Obstacle 344 is at high risk. It is very close to the ego vehicle longitudinally (0.00 m) and slightly to the right (-0.17 m). It is moving towards the ego vehicle both longitudinally (5.26 m/s) and laterally (2.25 m/s).  A collision is likely in the next timestep if the current trajectories continue.

**Risk Levels and Definitions:**
<Collision (Score: 0)>: Actual collision has occurred or is unavoidable within the next timestep.
<Extreme Risk (Score: 1)>: Immediate collision or very high likelihood of impact. Urgent action is required.
<High Risk (Score: 2)>: Close to collision or highly probable collision path. Needs prompt attention and quick manoeuvring.
<Medium Risk (Score: 3)>: Moderate collision risk but manageable with timely reactions and proper strategies.
<Low Risk (Score: 4)>: Minimal collision risk. The situation is controllable with sufficient time to react.
<Negligible Risk (Score: 5)>: No significant collision risk. Obstacles are either moving away or far enough not to interfere.

    "IsCollisionScenario": false,
    "Reasoning": "Obstacle 344 poses an extreme risk due to its proximity and velocity relative to the ego vehicle, indicating a very high likelihood of collision in the next timestep. Although no collision has occurred yet, the risk is imminent enough to warrant immediate evasive action."
