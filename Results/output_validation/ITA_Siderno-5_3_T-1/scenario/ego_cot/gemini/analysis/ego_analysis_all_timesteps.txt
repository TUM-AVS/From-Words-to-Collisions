### Safety analysis for timestep 1.5s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 312
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle approaching ego longitudinally (negative velocity) at a moderate distance. Lateral distance is significant. Front-left location.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: TTClong is positive, indicating time until potential longitudinal collision, but decreasing. No lateral relative motion (Vrel_lat = 0) meaning infinite TTClat.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- Obstacle ID: 344
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is very close behind the ego vehicle and approaching longitudinally (positive velocity) at close range and almost aligned laterally.
- Distance safety score: 2
- Time Risk reason: Very short TTClong.
- Time safety score: 2
- Overall Risk score: 2

- Obstacle ID: 355
- Distance Risk reason: Moderate longitudinal distance, but large lateral distance and moving away laterally. Front-right position.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: TTClong is positive and relatively large. TTClat is not relevant since obstacle moves away laterally (negative Vrel_lat).
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 359
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is in front and moderately close. It’s moving away longitudinally but lateral motion is unclear.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Positive and increasing TTClong, but no clear lateral movement assessment.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4



### Safety analysis for timestep 1.6s:
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 312
- Distance Risk reason: Similar to 1.5s, slightly further away.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Similar to 1.5s.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- Obstacle ID: 344
- Distance Risk reason: Closer than at 1.5s, high risk of rear-end collision.
- Distance safety score: 1
- Time Risk reason:  TTClong decreasing rapidly.
- Time safety score: 1
- Overall Risk score: 1

- Obstacle ID: 355
- Distance Risk reason:  Similar to 1.5s, safe and moving away laterally.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Similar to 1.5s.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 359
- Distance Risk reason: Moving further away longitudinally, lateral motion unclear.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Increasing TTClong.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4


### Safety analysis for timestep 1.7s through 2.4s:
**(Detailed analysis omitted for brevity, following the same logic as above.  Focus on Obstacle 344 and 312.  355 and 359 pose no immediate risk)**

Obstacle 344 continues to approach the ego vehicle from behind, with distance and TTClong decreasing, culminating in a collision (or near collision) at 2.4 seconds where the longitudinal distance becomes 0.

Obstacle 312 continues to approach the ego vehicle from the front-left. While it is getting closer, the rate of closure isn't as rapid as 344.


### Summary in JSON Format for 2.4s: 
```json
{
    "CollisionObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "344",
        "OverallRiskScore": "0"
    },
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null, 
    "IsCollisionScenario": true,
    "Justification": "Obstacle 344 has collided with the ego vehicle (or is extremely close) at 2.4 seconds based on longitudinal distance reaching 0m."
}
```
```
Key observations throughout the scenario:

* **Obstacle 344 (Rear):**  Presents the most significant risk.  The data shows a high probability of a rear-end collision.  
* **Obstacle 312 (Front-Left):**  Requires monitoring, but the risk is lower than 344 because it’s closing at a slower relative velocity than 344.
* **Obstacles 355 (Front-Right) and 359 (Front):** These do not present an immediate collision risk as they are either moving away or have sufficient lateral separation.


Important Note:  This analysis assumes a simplified collision model.  A real-world collision assessment in an autonomous driving system would use more complex shapes and account for vehicle dynamics, reaction times, and active safety systems.  The real distance is diagonal but relative velocities are longitudinal and lateral separately which is unrealistic. Therefore, I consider longitudinal values for TTC calculation instead of diagonal distance.
