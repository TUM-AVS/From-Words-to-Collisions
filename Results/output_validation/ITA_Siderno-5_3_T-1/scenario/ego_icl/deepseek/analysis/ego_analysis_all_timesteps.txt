Let me analyze each obstacle at the most recent timestep (2.4 seconds) and determine the collision risk.

### Obstacle 312 (Front-left)
- Adjusted distances: longitudinal 5.67m, lateral 25.30m
- Relative velocity: longitudinal -2.58 m/s (approaching), lateral 0.00 m/s
- Motion: Approaching longitudinally, no lateral motion
- Analysis:
  - Longitudinal TTC = 5.67/2.58 = 2.20s (Medium Risk)
  - Lateral distance is large and stable (No Risk)
  - MDC is the lateral distance (25.30m) since longitudinal approach isn't closing laterally
  - Overall Risk: 3 (Medium) due to longitudinal approach

### Obstacle 344 (Right)
- Adjusted distances: longitudinal 0.00m, lateral -0.17m
- Relative velocity: longitudinal 5.26 m/s, lateral 2.25 m/s
- Motion: Exact longitudinal alignment, approaching laterally from right
- Analysis:
  - Lateral TTC = 0.17/2.25 = 0.076s (Extreme Risk)
  - Longitudinal alignment but with high approach speed
  - MDC is effectively 0m since vehicles are longitudinally aligned and laterally closing
  - Overall Risk: 1 (Extreme Risk) - imminent lateral collision

### Obstacle 355 (Front-right)
- Adjusted distances: longitudinal 14.31m, lateral -9.35m
- Relative velocity: longitudinal -0.66 m/s, lateral -6.32 m/s
- Motion: Approaching longitudinally, moving away laterally
- Analysis:
  - Longitudinal TTC = 14.31/0.66 = 21.68s (No Risk)
  - Lateral distance increasing (No Risk)
  - MDC is large in both dimensions
  - Overall Risk: 5 (No Risk)

### Obstacle 359 (Front)
- Adjusted distances: longitudinal 7.77m, lateral 0.00m
- Relative velocity: longitudinal 3.97 m/s (moving away), lateral -3.93 m/s
- Motion: Moving away longitudinally, exact lateral alignment
- Analysis:
  - Negative relative velocity means increasing distance
  - No collision risk in either dimension
  - Overall Risk: 5 (No Risk)

### Trajectory Analysis:
- Obstacle 344 shows consistent approach from rear-right to right side:
  - At 2.3s: longitudinal -0.11m, lateral -0.28m
  - At 2.4s: longitudinal 0.00m, lateral -0.17m
  - Clearly crossing into ego's right side with high lateral velocity

{
    "CollisionObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": null,
        "OverallRiskScore": null
    },
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "344",
        "OverallRiskScore": "1"
    },
    "IsCollisionScenario": true,
    "Justification": "Obstacle 344 has reached exact longitudinal alignment (0.00m) with only 0.17m lateral separation and high lateral closing velocity (2.25 m/s), resulting in TTC of 0.076s (Extreme Risk). This indicates an imminent lateral collision."
