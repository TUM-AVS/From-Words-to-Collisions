* **Obstacle 312 (Front-Left):**  This obstacle has been consistently moving closer to the ego vehicle longitudinally over the observed time steps, while maintaining a constant lateral distance. At the last time step, it's 5.67m longitudinally and 25.30m laterally.  Given the lateral distance and the fact there's no lateral relative motion, a lateral collision is unlikely. Longitudinally, the relative velocity is -2.58 m/s. TTC = 5.67 / 2.58 ≈ 2.2 seconds. MDC can be approximated as the longitudinal distance at the last timestamp, which is 5.67m.  This results in a Low risk (4) based on TTC and No Risk (5) based on MDC.

* **Obstacle 344 (Right):**  This obstacle is the most concerning. It has been rapidly approaching the ego vehicle from behind and slightly to the right. In the last time step, it is precisely aligned longitudinally (0.00m) and only -0.17m laterally to the right.  The negative lateral distance indicates it's slightly to the right side of the ego.  The small lateral distance, near-zero longitudinal distance, and converging trajectory indicate extremely high risk. The relative longitudinal velocity is 5.26 m/s and the lateral is 2.25 m/s. With a lateral distance of 0.17m and lateral velocity of 2.25, the lateral TTC is under 0.1 seconds indicating an imminent collision.  MDC is < 0.5m. This is an **Extreme Risk (1)**.

* **Obstacle 355 (Front-Right):** This obstacle maintains a safe longitudinal distance (14.31m) and is moving further away laterally (-9.35m and increasing). With a longitudinal relative velocity of -0.66 m/s, the longitudinal TTC is 14.31 / 0.66 ≈ 21.7 seconds.  The large lateral distance and diverging lateral trajectory (-6.32 m/s) further decrease risk. MDC is > 5.0m. This translates to No Risk (5).

* **Obstacle 359 (Front):** This obstacle is directly ahead but moving away longitudinally (7.77m and increasing) with a velocity of 3.97 m/s. The exact lateral alignment (0.00m) isn't a concern since it's moving away longitudinally.  MDC is > 5.0m. This is clearly No Risk (5).


**Collision Scenario Determination:** Yes, this is a collision scenario. Obstacle 344 poses an Extreme Risk (1) with a very low TTC (< 0.1 seconds) and a near-zero distance in the most recent time step, indicating a likely imminent collision.
