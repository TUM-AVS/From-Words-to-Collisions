**Obstacle-by-Obstacle Analysis:**

1. **Obstacle 312 (Front-left)**
   - **Adjusted Distances:** Longitudinal = 5.67m, Lateral = 25.30m
   - **Relative Velocity:** Longitudinal = -2.58 m/s, Lateral = 0.00 m/s
   - **Trajectory Summary:** Obstacle is consistently reducing longitudinal distance toward the ego car with a negative velocity indicating it's approaching. Lateral distance is large, indicating no immediate lateral threat.
   - **TTC (Longitudinal):** 5.67m / 2.58 m/s = 2.20 seconds
   - **MDC (Longitudinal):** 5.67m (lateral risk is low because lateral distance is large)
   - **Risk Assessment:** 
     - TTC = Medium Risk (3)
     - MDC = Medium Risk (3)
     - Overall Risk = Medium Risk (3)

2. **Obstacle 344 (Right)**
   - **Adjusted Distances:** Longitudinal = 0.00m, Lateral = 0.17m
   - **Relative Velocity:** Longitudinal = 5.26 m/s, Lateral = 2.25 m/s
   - **Trajectory Summary:** The obstacle is extremely close in lateral alignment with near-zero separation. Positive relative velocity suggests it's moving into the ego's path from the right.
   - **TTC (Lateral):** 0.17m / 2.25 m/s = 0.08 seconds
   - **MDC (Lateral):** 0.17m
   - **Risk Assessment:** 
     - TTC = Extreme Risk (1)
     - MDC = Extreme Risk (1)
     - Overall Risk = Extreme Risk (1)
   
3. **Obstacle 355 (Front-right)**
   - **Adjusted Distances:** Longitudinal = 14.31m, Lateral = -9.35m
   - **Relative Velocity:** Longitudinal = -0.66 m/s, Lateral = -6.32 m/s
   - **Trajectory Summary:** The obstacle is moving away laterally and slightly closing longitudinally, large lateral distance maintains low risk.
   - **TTC (Longitudinal):** N/A (because relative velocity is negative longitudinally)
   - **MDC (Longitudinal):** 14.31m
   - **Risk Assessment:** 
     - TTC: Not approaching, so no TTC calculation
     - MDC = No Risk (5)
     - Overall Risk = No Risk (5)

4. **Obstacle 359 (Front)**
   - **Adjusted Distances:** Longitudinal = 7.77m, Lateral = 0.00m
   - **Relative Velocity:** Longitudinal = 3.97 m/s, Lateral = -3.93 m/s
   - **Trajectory Summary:** The obstacle is directly aligned in the lane but moving away longitudinally.
   - **TTC (Longitudinal):** N/A (moving away)
   - **MDC (Longitudinal):** 7.77m
   - **Risk Assessment:** 
     - TTC: N/A (moving away)
     - MDC = No Risk (5)
     - Overall Risk = No Risk (5)

**Conclusion:**
Obstacle 344 presents an **extreme risk** due to its very close lateral distance with converging motion and low TTC. This qualifies as a collision scenario due to the extreme risk identified.
