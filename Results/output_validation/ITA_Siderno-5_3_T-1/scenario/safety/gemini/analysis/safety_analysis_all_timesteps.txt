### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
    - Obstacle ID: 312
    - Relative Direction: Front-left
    - Distance Risk Reason: DTClong is decreasing over time, indicating increasing longitudinal risk. DTClat is large and safe.
    - Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 4 (3 < 5.67 <= 5)
    - Lateral Distance Safety Score: 5 (25.30 > 5)
    - Overall Distance Safety Score: 4.5 (4 * 0.5 + 5 * 0.5 = 4.5)
    - Time Risk Reason: TTClong is decreasing, indicating an increasing longitudinal risk. TTClat is infinite, posing no lateral risk.
    - Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 3 (1 < 2.20 <= 3)
    - Lateral Time Safety Score: 5 (inf > 5)
    - Overall Time Safety Score: 4 (3 * 0.5 + 5 * 0.5 = 4)
    - Overall Risk Score: 4 (0.5 * 4.5 + 0.5 * 4 = 4.25, rounded to 4)

    - Obstacle ID: 344
    - Relative Direction: Right
    - Distance Risk Reason: DTClong is 0 meaning a collision has occurred. DTClat is small, further indicating high lateral risk.
    - Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 0 (0.00 = 0)
    - Lateral Distance Safety Score: 1 (0 < 0.17 <= 0.5)
    - Overall Distance Safety Score: 1 (0 * 0 + 1 * (1-0) = 1)
    - Time Risk Reason: Both TTClong and TTClat are extremely low, indicating imminent collision risk from the right.
    - Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 0 (0 = 0)
    - Lateral Time Safety Score: 1 (0 < 0.08 <= 0.5)
    - Overall Time Safety Score: 1 (0 * 0 + 1 * (1-0) = 1)
    - Overall Risk Score: 1 (0.5 * 1 + 0.5 * 1 = 1)

    - Obstacle ID: 355
    - Relative Direction: Front-right
    - Distance Risk Reason: DTClong is safe and stable. DTClat is relatively safe but slightly decreasing.
    - Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 5 (14.31 > 5)
    - Lateral Distance Safety Score: 5 (-9.35 < -5; consider absolute value, thus > 5)
    - Overall Distance Safety Score: 5 (5 * 0.5 + 5 * 0.5 = 5)
    - Time Risk Reason: TTClong is very high, indicating minimal longitudinal risk.  TTClat is infinite, posing no lateral risk.
    - Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 5 (21.68 > 5)
    - Lateral Time Safety Score: 5 (inf > 5)
    - Overall Time Safety Score: 5 (5 * 0.5 + 5 * 0.5 = 5)
    - Overall Risk Score: 5 (0.5 * 5 + 0.5 * 5 = 5)

    - Obstacle ID: 359
    - Relative Direction: Front
    - Distance Risk Reason: DTClong is safe and increasing, suggesting the obstacle is moving away. DTClat is 0, representing perfect longitudinal alignment.
    - Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 5 (7.77 > 5)
    - Lateral Distance Safety Score: 0 (0 = 0)
    - Overall Distance Safety Score: 5 (5 * 1 + 0 * (1-1) = 5)
    - Time Risk Reason: TTClong is infinite, indicating no longitudinal risk.  TTClat is 0, which is a collision point.
    - Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 5 (inf > 5)
    - Lateral Time Safety Score: 0 (0 = 0)
    - Overall Time Safety Score: 5 (5 * 1.0 + 0 * (1-1) = 5)
    - Overall Risk Score: 5 (0.5 * 5 + 0.5 * 5 = 5)
