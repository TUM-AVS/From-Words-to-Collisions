Analysis:

Obstacle 3277: This obstacle is stationary in the same lane as the ego vehicle. The minimum distance between the ego and this obstacle over the provided timesteps is approximately 4.75 meters, occurring around t=5.3s. While the ego vehicle is decelerating, the lateral distance is substantial, suggesting a low risk of collision. However, given their proximity and shared lane, the situation warrants monitoring. Assigned Risk Score: 2 (High Risk)

Obstacle 3278: This obstacle is stationary in a different lane (340) than the ego vehicle (605). Its position remains constant throughout the scenario.  The minimum distance is approximately 18.5 meters during the provided timesteps, and there's a significant lateral separation. This obstacle poses no immediate threat. Assigned Risk Score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
