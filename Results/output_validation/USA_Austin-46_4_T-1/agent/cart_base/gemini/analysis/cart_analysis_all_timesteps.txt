Obstacle 3277: This obstacle is stationary in lanelet 605, the same lanelet as the ego vehicle. The ego vehicle is approaching this obstacle while decelerating.  The y-coordinates suggest the obstacle and ego vehicle are not perfectly aligned laterally within the lanelet, but the distance between them is decreasing over time.  This represents a high risk of collision if the ego vehicle does not brake sufficiently or maneuver to avoid the obstacle.

Obstacle 3278: This obstacle is stationary in a different lanelet (340).  While its absolute distance from the ego vehicle is not provided, the different lanelet IDs and the fact that the obstacle is stationary suggest a significantly lower risk of collision compared to Obstacle 3277. We can tentatively assess this as a low to negligible risk given the provided data.  More information about the lanelets' spatial relationship would be needed for a more definitive assessment.
