Obstacle 3277 is stationary in the same lane as the ego vehicle, and the ego vehicle is approaching it while decelerating.  At the last timestep (6.2 seconds), the ego vehicle is at (-468.7084, 21.9582) and obstacle 3277 is at (-473.2468, 23.5096). The distance between them is approximately 4.6 meters.  Although the ego vehicle is decelerating, the current velocity and proximity suggest a high risk of collision if the ego vehicle does not decelerate more significantly.

Obstacle 3278 is stationary in a different lane and poses no immediate risk.
