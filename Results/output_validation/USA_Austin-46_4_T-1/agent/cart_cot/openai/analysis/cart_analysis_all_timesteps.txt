To analyze the risk of collision in this scenario, we evaluate the positional, velocity, and acceleration data along with considering the relative motion of obstacles in the same or different lanelets.

### Analysis

1. **Obstacle 3277.0** is in the same lanelet as the Ego vehicle (605.0), but it is stationary with a position of (-473.2468, 23.5096) across all timesteps. The ego vehicle shows a reduction in velocity, moving from positions (-468.4993, 21.8894) to (-468.7084, 21.9582). This results in the ego vehicle approaching obstacle 3277.0 while slowing down. Assuming the ego vehicle proceeds with its current deceleration, a collision might occur, but the reduced speed and acceleration suggest that there is potential for the ego vehicle to stop or maneuver away in time. Thus, the risk is heightened, but not yet at imminent collision level, keeping it at an **Extreme Risk (1)** rather than an unavoidable collision.

2. **Obstacle 3278.0** is in a different lanelet (340.0) with no change in position, indicating it's not in the direct path of the ego vehicle, reducing the likelihood of an immediate collision to Low or Negligible Risk.

Since none of the analyzed obstacles can be associated with unavoidable physical contact presently, no objects will have a **Collision Risk Score of 0**.
