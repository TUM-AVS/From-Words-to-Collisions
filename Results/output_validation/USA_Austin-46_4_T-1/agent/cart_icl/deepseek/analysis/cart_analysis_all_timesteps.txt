### Analysis:

1. **Obstacle 3277.0**:
   - **Position**: (-473.2468, 23.5096) (same lanelet as ego, lanelet 605.0).
   - **Motion**: Stationary (velocity = 0.0, acceleration = 0.0).
   - **Relative Motion**: Ego is approaching the obstacle with decreasing velocity (from 0.356 m/s to 0.1113 m/s) and decelerating (acceleration ranges from -0.3129 to -0.0976).
   - **Distance**: The distance between ego and obstacle is decreasing but remains significant (~4.7m longitudinally and ~1.6m laterally).
   - **TTC**: Since the ego is decelerating and the obstacle is stationary, the TTC is increasing as the ego slows down. The current TTC is not critical.
   - **Risk**: **Low Risk (4)**. The ego is decelerating and the distance is not closing dangerously.

2. **Obstacle 3278.0**:
   - **Position**: (-486.9494, 13.4028) (different lanelet, lanelet 340.0).
   - **Motion**: Stationary (velocity = 0.0, acceleration = 0.0).
   - **Relative Motion**: The ego is moving away from this obstacle (longitudinal distance increasing).
   - **Distance**: The distance is large (~18.4m longitudinally and ~8.5m laterally).
   - **TTC**: Not applicable as the ego is moving away.
   - **Risk**: **Negligible Risk (5)**. No meaningful risk.
