Obstacle 3277 is stationary in the same lane as the ego vehicle, and the ego vehicle is slowing down.  The distance between the two is small and decreasing.  At the last timestep the distance between the ego vehicle at (-468.7084, 21.9582) and obstacle 3277 at (-473.2468, 23.5096) is approximately 5.16 meters. Since the ego vehicle continues to approach the stationary obstacle, this represents a high risk of collision.

Obstacle 3278 is stationary in a different lanelet and poses no immediate risk.
