Let's analyze the scenario step-by-step to assess the collision risk level for each obstacle.

### Key Observations:
- **Ego Vehicle**:
  - The ego vehicle is slowly decelerating, and by 6.2 seconds, its velocity has decreased to 0.1113 m/s.
  - The orientation indicates the ego's trajectory is consistent but with slight variations in its heading.

- **Obstacle 3277.0**:
  - Stationary, located within the same lanelet as the ego vehicle (605.0).
  - No changes in position throughout the timesteps, which suggests a stationary object in the ego's path.

- **Obstacle 3278.0**:
  - Stationary and located in a different lanelet (340.0) throughout the observations.
  - Given the different lanelet and distance (about 20 meters away laterally), it is irrelevant to the current collision consideration.

### Risk Evaluation:
- **Obstacle 3277.0**:
  - It shares the same lanelet with the ego vehicle, indicating possible concern regarding collision.
  - At 6.2 seconds, the distance to obstacle 3277.0 is approximately 5 meters longitudinally.
  - With the ego vehicle eventually coming to a stop and both remaining in the same lanelet, the scenario suggests a need for urgent action. However, given the velocity and deceleration, a collision is not imminent within the next second due to the slowing down trend.

- **Obstacle 3278.0**:
  - Its risk is negligible due to being in a different lanelet and no converging path with the ego vehicle.

Let's put together the JSON output based on the analysis, focusing on the obstacle with the highest risk:

```json
{
    "CollisionObstacles": [],
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "3277.0",
        "OverallRiskScore": 1
    },
    "HighRiskObstacle": null
}
```

**Note**: Obstacle 3277.0 needs extreme caution but is unlikely to result in collision by the next second due to the ego's reducing speed and distance to handle the obstacle.
