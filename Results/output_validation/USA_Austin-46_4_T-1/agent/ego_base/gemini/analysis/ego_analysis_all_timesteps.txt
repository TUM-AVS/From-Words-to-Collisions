At t=6.2s, obstacle 3277 is located directly in front of the ego vehicle at a longitudinal distance of 0.29m. This is extremely close, suggesting a very high risk of collision. The relative longitudinal velocity is -0.11 m/s, indicating that the obstacle is still moving towards the ego vehicle, albeit slowly.  The small relative velocity might be due to braking but the proximity necessitates immediate action.

Obstacle 3278, at t=6.2s, maintains a longitudinal distance of 10.09m and a lateral distance of 12.27m from the ego vehicle. While it's moving towards the ego car longitudinally with a relative velocity of -0.11 m/s, the substantial distance suggests there is no immediate danger.  It presents a low risk currently.


Risk Levels:
0: Collision - Physical contact occurred or unavoidable
1: Extreme Risk - Immediate collision likely
2: High Risk - Close to collision, needs quick action
3: Medium Risk - Manageable with proper reaction
4: Low Risk - Minimal risk, sufficient time to react
5: Negligible Risk - No significant risk
