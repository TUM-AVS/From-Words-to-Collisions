### Safety analysis for timestep 6.2s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

**Calculations and Assumptions:**

* **Adjusted Distance:**  Since no vehicle size information is provided, we'll assume the provided distances already incorporate vehicle size considerations.  Therefore, `adjusted_d_long = DTClong` and `adjusted_d_lat = DTClat`.
* **TTC:** We calculate TTC using the formula: `TTC = Distance / Relative Velocity`.  If the relative velocity is positive (moving away), we assume a TTC of infinity (represented as a high value like 999 for practical purposes).
* **Obstacle 3277:** This obstacle poses the most significant risk. It is very close and approaching the ego vehicle.
* **Obstacle 3278:** While this obstacle is moving towards the ego vehicle, it is at a safe distance and its slow relative velocity makes the risk low.

### Obstacle Analysis:

**- Obstacle ID: 3277**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 3277 is extremely close to the ego vehicle in the front (0.29m longitudinally and laterally), indicating a near-certain collision if the current trajectory continues.
- Distance safety score: 1 (Extreme Risk)
- Time Risk reason: The relative longitudinal velocity is -0.11 m/s.  TTClong = 0.29m / 0.11 m/s ≈ 2.6s. This suggests a high risk of collision if no evasive action is taken.
- Time safety score: 3 (Medium Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 1 (Extreme Risk - due to extremely close proximity overriding the medium TTC risk)

**- Obstacle ID: 3278**
- Distance Risk reason: The obstacle is located at a safe longitudinal and lateral distance (10.09m).
- Distance safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- Time Risk reason:  The relative longitudinal velocity is -0.11 m/s. TTClong = 10.09m / 0.11 m/s ≈ 91.7s. The large TTC value suggests no immediate risk.
- Time safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
