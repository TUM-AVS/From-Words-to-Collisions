### Analysis for Most Recent Timestep (6.2 seconds):

#### Obstacle 3277 (Front of ego car):
- **Adjusted Distance**: Longitudinal 0.29 m, Lateral 0.00 m
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal -0.11 m/s (approaching), Lateral -0.00 m/s (no lateral motion)
- **Motion**: Driving toward ego car longitudinally, exact lateral alignment.

**Risk Assessment**:
1. **Proximity**: Very close longitudinally (0.29 m) with exact lateral alignment.
2. **MDC**: 0.29 m (longitudinal, since lateral is 0.00 m and stable). This falls in the **Extreme Risk** range (0.5 < MDC ≤ 1.0 m).
3. **TTC**: 
   - Longitudinal TTC = 0.29 m / 0.11 m/s ≈ 2.63 s (Medium Risk).
   - Lateral TTC is not applicable (no relative motion).
   - Overall TTC is 2.63 s (Medium Risk).
4. **Trajectory Analysis**: Over the timesteps, the longitudinal distance is decreasing (from 0.51 m to 0.29 m), but the relative velocity is also decreasing (from -0.36 m/s to -0.11 m/s). This suggests the obstacle is decelerating but still approaching.
5. **Overall Risk**: Prioritize the higher risk (MDC indicates Extreme Risk (1), TTC indicates Medium Risk (3)). Thus, **Extreme Risk (1)**.

#### Obstacle 3278 (Front-left of ego car):
- **Adjusted Distance**: Longitudinal 10.09 m, Lateral 12.27 m
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal -0.11 m/s (approaching), Lateral -0.00 m/s (no lateral motion)
- **Motion**: Driving toward ego car longitudinally, no lateral relative motion.

**Risk Assessment**:
1. **Proximity**: Far longitudinally (10.09 m) and laterally (12.27 m).
2. **MDC**: The smaller distance is longitudinal (10.09 m), which is > 5.0 m (No Risk).
3. **TTC**: 
   - Longitudinal TTC = 10.09 m / 0.11 m/s ≈ 91.73 s (No Risk).
   - Lateral TTC is not applicable (no relative motion).
   - Overall TTC is 91.73 s (No Risk).
4. **Trajectory Analysis**: The longitudinal distance is very large and decreasing very slowly. No lateral motion. No immediate risk.
5. **Overall Risk**: **Negligible Risk (5)**.

### Reasoning:
- **Obstacle 3277**: The longitudinal distance is very small (0.29 m) and decreasing, but the relative velocity is also low (-0.11 m/s). This places it in the Extreme Risk category due to proximity, but not yet a collision (no physical contact or unavoidable collision). The TTC is medium, but the MDC takes precedence due to the very small distance.
- **Obstacle 3278**: No significant risk due to large distances and minimal relative motion.
- No collision is occurring or predicted at this timestep, but Obstacle 3277 is in Extreme Risk and requires immediate attention.
