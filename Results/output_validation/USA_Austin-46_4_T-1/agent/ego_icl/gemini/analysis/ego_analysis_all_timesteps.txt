Obstacle 3277:

- Trajectory: This obstacle has been consistently in front of the ego vehicle and laterally aligned (0.00m lateral distance) across all timesteps. The longitudinal distance has been steadily decreasing, indicating a closing motion.
- Most Recent Timestep (6.2s):
    - Longitudinal distance: 0.29m
    - Lateral distance: 0.00m
    - Longitudinal relative velocity: -0.11 m/s (approaching)
- TTC: 0.29m / 0.11 m/s = 2.64s
- MDC: 0.29m 
- Risk Assessment:
    - Based on MDC (0.29m), the risk is High (2).
    - Based on TTC (2.64s), the risk is Medium (3).
    - Overall Risk: High (2) - prioritizing the higher risk from MDC.

Obstacle 3278:

- Trajectory: This obstacle has been consistently in the front-left of the ego vehicle across all timesteps.  The longitudinal distance has shown some fluctuation but generally decreasing. The lateral distance has been relatively stable.
- Most Recent Timestep (6.2s):
    - Longitudinal distance: 10.09m
    - Lateral distance: 12.27m
    - Longitudinal relative velocity: -0.11 m/s (approaching)
- TTC: 10.09m / 0.11 m/s = 91.73s (longitudinal). Lateral velocity is negligible.
- MDC:  Given the distances and trajectory, the MDC is significantly greater than 5m.
- Risk Assessment:
    - Based on both MDC and TTC, the risk is Negligible (5).

Final Assessment:

Obstacle 3277 poses a High risk (2) due to its close proximity and continued approach towards the ego vehicle.  Obstacle 3278 presents no immediate risk.
