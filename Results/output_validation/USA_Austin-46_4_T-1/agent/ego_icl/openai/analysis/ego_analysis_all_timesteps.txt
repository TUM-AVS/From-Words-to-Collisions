### Obstacle Analysis:

#### Obstacle 3277:
- **Position & Motion**: This obstacle is directly in front of the ego vehicle with a decreasing longitudinal distance over time and exact lateral alignment.
- **Current Adjusted Distances**: Longitudinal = 0.29 m, Lateral = 0.00 m
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal = -0.11 m/s, indicating the obstacle is approaching the ego vehicle.
- **TTC Calculation**:
  - \( \text{TTC} = \frac{\text{Adjusted Longitudinal Distance}}{|\text{Relative Velocity}|} = \frac{0.29}{0.11} \approx 2.64 \, \text{seconds} \)
- **MDC**: The calculated MDC is the current adjusted longitudinal distance of 0.29 meters.
- **Risk Assessment**:
  - Based on the calculated TTC (2.64 seconds), it lies within the "Medium Risk" category (1.0 < TTC ≤ 3.0 seconds).
  - Based on the MDC (0.29 meters), this falls under "Extreme Risk" (MDC ≤ 0.5 meters).
  - As the lowest score is prioritized, the risk is EXTREME (1).

#### Obstacle 3278:
- **Position & Motion**: This obstacle is in the front-left of the ego vehicle. The longitudinal and lateral distances are relatively stable across the timeline.
- **Current Adjusted Distances**: Longitudinal = 10.09 m, Lateral = 12.27 m
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal = -0.11 m/s; no lateral motion.
- **TTC Calculation**:
  - Since the relative velocity is small, TTC calculation is not significant for this large distance. The obstacle isn't approaching significantly.
- **MDC**: Given the distance not reducing strongly, the MDC remains large (> 5.0 meters).
- **Risk Assessment**: 
  - Both TTC and MDC provide a "No Risk" (5) outcome due to maintaining a safe distance without converging trajectories.

### Conclusion
- Obstacle 3277 presents an extreme risk due to the close proximity and converging path. Immediate action is needed to prevent a potential collision.
- Obstacle 3278 maintains a safe distance and does not present any significant risk at the current moment.
