At time 6.4 seconds, the ego vehicle at (-468.73, 21.9653) is in the same lane (605) as obstacle 3277 at (-473.2468, 23.5096).  The ego vehicle is slowing down significantly (velocity decreasing, negative acceleration), and obstacle 3277 is stationary.  Given the proximity in position (approximately 4.5 units apart) and the ego vehicle's decreasing velocity, the vehicles are likely to collide or come extremely close to colliding.  The y-coordinate differences suggest the vehicles are not perfectly aligned laterally, but the small difference (1.5 units) doesn't eliminate the risk. Obstacle 3278 is in a different lane and poses no immediate risk.
