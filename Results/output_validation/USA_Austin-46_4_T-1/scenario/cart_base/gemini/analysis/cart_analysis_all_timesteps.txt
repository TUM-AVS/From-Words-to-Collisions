At t=6.4s, Ego is in lanelet 605.0 at (-468.73, 21.9653) with a decreasing velocity (0.0886 m/s).

Obstacle 3277.0 is stationary in the same lanelet (605.0) at (-473.2468, 23.5096).  The y-coordinates suggest a potential lateral offset issue, but the x-distance is approximately 4.5 meters.  Given Ego's decelerating trajectory, a collision is not imminent within the next few timesteps. This is likely a High (2) or Medium (3) risk, but not Extreme (1).

Obstacle 3278.0 is stationary in a different lanelet (340.0) at (-486.9494, 13.4028). The lateral and longitudinal distances are significant, posing no immediate threat.  Risk is Negligible (5).
