### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 3277.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 3277.0 is in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle and remains stationary throughout the provided timeframe. At the most recent timestep (6.4s), the Y-coordinate difference is approximately 1.5m and the X-coordinate difference is approximately 4.7m. While not extremely close, the consistent presence and stationary nature of the obstacle coupled with the ego vehicle's decreasing velocity represent a potential collision risk if the ego vehicle continues on its current trajectory and deceleration rate.
- Distance safety score: 2
- Time Risk reason: The ego vehicle is approaching the stationary obstacle, evident in the decreasing X-coordinate difference over the timesteps.  While the ego vehicle is decelerating, its velocity is still positive towards the obstacle.  Given the current trajectory and deceleration rate, a collision within the near future is plausible.
- Time safety score: 2
- Overall Risk score: 2

- Obstacle ID: 3278.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 3278.0 is in a different lanelet than the ego vehicle.  The Y-coordinate difference is substantial (approximately 8.5m) and the X-coordinate difference is significant (approximately 18.2m) at the latest timestep. This obstacle poses no immediate threat.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: This obstacle is stationary and poses no risk over the observed timesteps.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5


### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. **Identify the most critical obstacles:** Obstacle 3277.0 is the most critical obstacle, sharing the same lanelet as the ego vehicle and remaining stationary while the ego vehicle approaches.  Obstacle 3278.0 poses no immediate threat due to distance and being in a different lanelet.

2. **Analyze their trajectories over all 10 timesteps:** Obstacle 3277.0 remains stationary.  Obstacle 3278.0 remains stationary. The ego vehicle continues to approach obstacle 3277.0 while decelerating.

3. **Evaluate relative positions, velocities and accelerations:** The ego vehicle is closing the distance to obstacle 3277.0 in the x-direction. While the ego vehicle is decelerating, its velocity is still positive.  The y-coordinate difference is small and potentially problematic.

4. **Determine if any collision has occurred or is imminent:** While a collision hasn't occurred yet, it is a possibility in the near future if the current trajectories continue. The ego vehicle's deceleration might not be sufficient to avoid a collision with the stationary obstacle 3277.0.

5. **Explain your reasoning for your conclusion:** Based on the decreasing x-coordinate difference and the consistently small y-coordinate difference between the ego vehicle and obstacle 3277.0, there is a high risk of collision if the current trends continue.  The ego vehicle needs to either significantly increase its deceleration rate or alter its trajectory to avoid collision.

  "CollisionObstacles": null,
  "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {
    "ObstacleID": "3277.0",

  },
  "ScenarioAnalysis": {
    "IsCollisionScenario": false,
    "Reasoning": "While a collision is not certain yet, there is a significant and increasing risk of collision between the ego vehicle and obstacle 3277.0.  The ego vehicle is approaching the stationary obstacle in the same lanelet and, while decelerating, might not do so sufficiently to avoid impact. The lateral distance is also minimal, further increasing the risk."
