### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep:

### Obstacle Analysis:
#### Obstacle ID: 3277.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is stationary at (-473.2468, 23.5096) while the ego vehicle is moving towards it (current position: -468.73, 21.9653). The distance between them is ~4.52m (Euclidean) and decreasing over time (from ~4.68m at 5.5s to ~4.52m at 6.4s). They are in the same lanelet (605.0), indicating a direct path risk.
- **Distance safety score**: 2 (High Risk)
- **Time Risk reason**: The ego vehicle is decelerating (current velocity: 0.0886 m/s, acceleration: -0.0629 m/s²), but the relative velocity is still positive (obstacle is stationary). TTC ≈ distance/velocity = 4.52/0.0886 ≈ 51s, but the trend shows closing distance.
- **Time safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk)
- **Overall Risk score**: 2 (High Risk)

#### Obstacle ID: 3278.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is stationary at (-486.9494, 13.4028), far from the ego vehicle (~18.23m Euclidean distance). It is in a different lanelet (340.0), and the distance has remained constant over all timesteps.
- **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- **Time Risk reason**: No relative motion (both stationary in recent timesteps). No risk of collision.
- **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- **Overall Risk score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. **Obstacle 3277.0**: Same lanelet as ego, stationary, and ego is approaching it. Distance is decreasing but still >4m. Ego is decelerating, reducing risk.
2. **Obstacle 3278.0**: Different lanelet, stationary, and far away. No risk.
3. **Conclusion**: No collision is imminent, but Obstacle 3277.0 requires monitoring due to decreasing distance.
