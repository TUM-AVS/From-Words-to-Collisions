### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 3277.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 3277.0 is in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle and relatively close. The Y-coordinate difference is small (around 1.5m), suggesting a lateral risk. Although the X-coordinate difference is around 4.5m, the ego vehicle is slowing down significantly while the obstacle is stationary. This proximity combined with the ego vehicle's decreasing velocity poses a risk.
- Distance safety score: 2
- Time Risk reason: The ego vehicle is decelerating while the obstacle is stationary.  Given the small relative distance, the continuing deceleration of the ego vehicle increases the risk of collision over the next few seconds.
- Time safety score: 2
- Overall Risk score: 2

- Obstacle ID: 3278.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 3278.0 is in a different lanelet and further away laterally (Y-coordinate difference ~8.5m) and longitudinally (X-coordinate difference ~18m) compared to obstacle 3277. Although the ego vehicle is decelerating, the significant distance and different lanelet suggest minimal immediate risk.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: The substantial distance and separate lane suggest a low time-based risk despite the ego vehicle's deceleration.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4


### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. **Identify potential collision candidates:** Obstacle 3277.0 is the primary concern due to its proximity and being in the same lane.  Obstacle 3278.0 is less concerning due to distance and lane separation.
2. **Analyze trajectories:** Obstacle 3277.0 is stationary, while the ego vehicle is approaching it while decelerating.  This trajectory creates a high probability of a near miss or potential collision if the ego vehicle continues its current deceleration trend.
3. **Assess risk:** The combination of proximity, same lanelet, and ego vehicle deceleration makes this a high-risk scenario for Obstacle 3277.0. Obstacle 3278.0 poses a significantly lower risk due to distance and lane separation.
