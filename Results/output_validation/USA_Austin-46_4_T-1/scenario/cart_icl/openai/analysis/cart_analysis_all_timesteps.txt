### Obstacle Analysis:

#### Obstacle ID: 3277.0

- **Distance Risk Reason**: Obstacle 3277.0 remains stationary in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle over the previous 10 timesteps, while the ego is moving very slowly and decelerating. The distance between the ego and obstacle 3277.0 slightly decreases but remains relatively significant, suggesting no immediate close proximity.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 3 (Medium Risk; moderate risk but manageable with proper attention)

- **Time Risk Reason**: Considering the stationary nature of obstacle 3277.0 and the continuous deceleration of the ego vehicle, the time to reach obstacle 3277.0 increases. The relative velocity is almost zero due to the slow speed of the ego, leading to increasing time-to-collision if the trends continue.
- **Time Safety Score**: 4 (Low Risk; minimal collision risk given capabilities to react in time)

- **Overall Risk Score**: 3 (Medium Risk; integrated analysis indicates manageable collision risk, provided adequate attention to deceleration)

#### Obstacle ID: 3278.0

- **Distance Risk Reason**: Obstacle 3278.0 is located in a different lanelet and remains stationary. The position has not altered relative to the ego vehicle over the last 10 timesteps, indicating no interaction trajectory with the ego.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 5 (Negligible Risk; far enough not to interfere)

- **Time Risk Reason**: With no movement and in a separate lanelet, obstacle 3278.0 does not influence time-based collision forecasts for the ego. The relative velocity and any practical time-to-collision consideration remain non-critical owing to the spatial separation.
- **Time Safety Score**: 5 (Negligible Risk; no significant impact due to static positioning and separate trajectory)

- **Overall Risk Score**: 5 (Negligible Risk; outside actionable range of collision assessment)

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:

- The scenario involves the ego vehicle moving very slowly and steadily decelerating, with obstacle 3277.0 stationary in the same lanelet.
- The consistent deceleration and slight movements of the ego result in a manageably increasing spatial distance gap, and thus the time factor remains favorable given the speeds involved.
- Obstacle 3278.0 poses no risk as it resides completely separated in another lanelet.
- This scenario is not a collision scenario as there is no immediate collision to be expected with either obstacle.
