Obstacle 3277 is extremely close to the ego vehicle, with a longitudinal distance of only 0.27 meters at the most recent timestep (6.4 seconds). The relative longitudinal velocity is negative, indicating that the obstacle is moving towards the ego vehicle, although the rate of closure is slowing.  Given the minimal distance and continued approach, a collision is imminent.

Obstacle 3278, while moving slightly closer longitudinally, maintains a safe lateral and longitudinal distance (10.15m and 12.19m respectively) and poses no immediate threat.

    "IsCollisionScenario": false,
    "Reasoning": "Obstacle 3277 poses an extreme risk with a very high likelihood of collision in the next timestep due to its proximity (0.27m) and continuing approach, though decelerating. While not a collision yet, immediate action is required. Obstacle 3278 does not pose a significant risk."
