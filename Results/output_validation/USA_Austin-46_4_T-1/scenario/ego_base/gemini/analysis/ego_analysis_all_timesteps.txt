Obstacle 3277 is very close to the ego vehicle, with a longitudinal distance of only 0.27m.  The relative longitudinal velocity is -0.09 m/s, indicating it is still moving towards the ego vehicle. While the relative velocity is small, the proximity poses a significant risk.

Obstacle 3278 is at a safe distance and poses no immediate risk.


**Risk Levels and Definitions:**
<Collision (Score: 0)>: Actual collision has occurred or is unavoidable within the next timestep.
<Extreme Risk (Score: 1)>: Immediate collision or very high likelihood of impact. Urgent action is required.
<High Risk (Score: 2)>: Close to collision or highly probable collision path. Needs prompt attention and quick manoeuvring.
<Medium Risk (Score: 3)>: Moderate collision risk but manageable with timely reactions and proper strategies.
<Low Risk (Score: 4)>: Minimal collision risk. The situation is controllable with sufficient time to react.
<Negligible Risk (Score: 5)>: No significant collision risk. Obstacles are either moving away or far enough not to interfere.
