### Safety analysis for timestep 5.5s - 6.4s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

Obstacle 3277 consistently poses an extreme risk of collision throughout the entire timeframe. Its longitudinal distance to the ego vehicle decreases from 0.44m to 0.27m, indicating an imminent collision.  The relative longitudinal velocity, though decreasing in magnitude, remains negative, confirming the closing distance. The small lateral distance further emphasizes the direct collision course.

Obstacle 3278, while moving towards the ego vehicle, maintains a safe distance ranging from 10.09m to 10.29m longitudinally and laterally.  Despite the negative relative longitudinal velocity, the substantial distance and slow closing speed suggest a negligible risk.

**Calculations and Reasoning for Obstacle 3277:**

TTClong is difficult to calculate accurately because of the varying relative velocity and acceleration. A simple calculation (distance/velocity) at 5.5s gives 0.44m/0.28m/s = 1.57s. This decreases to approximately 0.27m/0.09m/s = 3s at 6.4s. This indicates that although the closing speed is decreasing, a collision appears imminent without intervention.

**Calculations and Reasoning for Obstacle 3278:**

TTClong at 5.5s is approximately 10.29m/0.28m/s = 36.75s. At 6.4s it is around 10.15m/0.09m/s = 112.7s.  These values indicate a negligible collision risk.

### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
  "CollisionObstacle": null,
  "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {
    "ObstacleID": "3277",
    "OverallRiskScore": "1"
  },
  "IsCollisionScenario": false,
  "Justification": "While no collision is registered within the provided timeframe, Obstacle 3277 poses an extreme risk and a collision is highly likely in the immediate future without intervention. The decreasing distance and continuous negative relative velocity toward the ego vehicle indicate a high probability of impact within the next few seconds.  Obstacle 3278 is not considered a risk."
