### Obstacle-by-Obstacle Analysis (Most Recent Timestep: 6.4 seconds)

#### **Obstacle 3277 (Front of ego car)**
- **Adjusted Distance**: Longitudinal = 0.27 m, Lateral = 0.00 m  
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal = -0.09 m/s (approaching), Lateral = -0.00 m/s (no lateral motion)  
- **Motion**: Exact lateral alignment, approaching longitudinally.  

**Trajectory Analysis**:  
- Over the last 1 second (5.5s to 6.4s), the longitudinal distance has decreased from 0.44 m to 0.27 m at a nearly constant rate (~0.02 m per 0.1s).  
- The relative velocity is decreasing slightly (from -0.28 m/s to -0.09 m/s), but the obstacle is still closing in.  

**Risk Assessment**:  
1. **Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC)**:  
   - Current longitudinal distance = 0.27 m (falls in **Extreme Risk** category: 0 < MDC ≤ 0.5 m).  
   - Lateral distance = 0.00 m (aligned).  
   - **MDC Risk Score: 1 (Extreme Risk)**  

2. **Time-to-Collision (TTC)**:  
   - TTC = Distance / |Relative Velocity| = 0.27 / 0.09 ≈ **3.0 seconds**  
   - Falls in **Medium Risk** category (1.0 < TTC ≤ 3.0 s).  
   - **TTC Risk Score: 3 (Medium Risk)**  

3. **Overall Risk**:  
   - Prioritize the higher risk (lower score).  
   - **Overall Risk Score: 1 (Extreme Risk)**  

**Conclusion for Obstacle 3277**:  
- Extreme Risk (1) due to very small longitudinal distance (0.27 m) and closing velocity.  
- No collision yet (distance > 0), but imminent if no intervention.

#### **Obstacle 3278 (Front-left of ego car)**
- **Adjusted Distance**: Longitudinal = 10.15 m, Lateral = 12.19 m  
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal = -0.09 m/s (approaching), Lateral = -0.00 m/s (no lateral motion)  
- **Motion**: No lateral relative motion, slowly approaching longitudinally.  

**Trajectory Analysis**:  
- Longitudinal distance has decreased slightly (from 10.29 m to 10.15 m over 1 second).  
- Lateral distance is stable (~12.2 m).  

**Risk Assessment**:  
1. **Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC)**:  
   - Both distances are large (> 10 m).  
   - **MDC Risk Score: 5 (No Risk)**  

2. **Time-to-Collision (TTC)**:  
   - TTC is not meaningfully calculable (relative velocity is negligible).  
   - **TTC Risk Score: 5 (No Risk)**  

3. **Overall Risk**:  
   - **Overall Risk Score: 5 (No Risk)**  

**Conclusion for Obstacle 3278**:  
- No risk (5) due to large distances and negligible relative motion.

### Final Determination  
- **Obstacle 3277** is at **Extreme Risk (1)** due to very close proximity (0.27 m longitudinally) and closing velocity.  
- **Obstacle 3278** poses **No Risk (5)**.  
- This is **not yet a collision scenario** (distance > 0), but it is **extremely close to collision** and requires immediate intervention.
