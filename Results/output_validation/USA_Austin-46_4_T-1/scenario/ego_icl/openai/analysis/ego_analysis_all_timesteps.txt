### Obstacle-by-Obstacle Analysis

#### Obstacle 3277:
- **Position at 6.4 seconds**: Longitudinal distance = 0.27m, Lateral distance = 0.00m
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal velocity = -0.09 m/s, Lateral velocity = 0.00 m/s
- **Trajectory**: Obstacle positioned directly in front with closing velocity, steadily decreasing longitudinal distances indicating an approach.
- **TTC Calculation**: 
  \[
  \text{TTC (longitudinal)} = \frac{0.27 \text{ m}}{0.09 \text{ m/s}} = 3.0 \text{ seconds}
  \]
- **MDC**: 0.27 meters (current longitudinal distance, decreasing)
- **Risk Evaluation**:
  - Given the longitudinal distance is reducing continuously and the TTC of 3.0 seconds, the risk is on the boundary of medium risk.
  - The MDC of 0.27 meters (below 0.5 meters) indicates an extreme risk, prioritizing this over the calculated TTC.
  - This heavily implies that, without intervention, collision is imminent.

#### Obstacle 3278:
- **Position at 6.4 seconds**: Longitudinal distance = 10.15m, Lateral distance = 12.19m
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal velocity = -0.09 m/s, Lateral velocity = 0.00 m/s
- **Trajectory**: Positioned diagonally in front-left, with consistent large distances that aren't rapidly decreasing.
- **TTC Calculation**: 
  \[
  \text{TTC (longitudinal)} = \frac{10.15 \text{ m}}{0.09 \text{ m/s}} \approx 112.78 \text{ seconds}
  \]
- **MDC**: 10.15 meters (longitudinal current distance)
- **Risk Evaluation**:
  - Given the substantial longitudinal and lateral distances and the large TTC, this obstacle poses no immediate risk.
  - The risk score is considered "No Risk" (5), as the pathways do not converge significantly.

### Conclusion and Collision Determination

Based on the analysis, obstacle 3277 presents an extreme risk (1) scenario with an MDC well below the crucial threshold, marking it as potentially dangerous without immediate correction. According to the assessment criteria, even though the calculated TTC is 3 seconds, the MDC is more critical in this scenario as it indicates a clear path to collision.
