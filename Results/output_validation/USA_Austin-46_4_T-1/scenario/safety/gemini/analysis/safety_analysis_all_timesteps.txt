### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
    - Obstacle ID: 3277
    - Relative Direction: Front
    - Distance Risk Reason: DTClong is 0.27m, indicating extreme risk.  The obstacle has consistently been approaching the ego vehicle over the past 10 timesteps, with DTClong decreasing steadily. DTClat is 0.0m, posing no lateral risk. Since the obstacle is directly in front, the longitudinal distance is the primary concern.
    - Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 1
    - Lateral Distance Safety Score: 5
    - Overall Distance Safety Score: 1.0  (1 * 1.0 + 5 * (1-1.0) = 1)
    - Time Risk Reason: TTClong is 2.99s, approaching a medium risk level. While TTClat is 0.0s due to perfect lateral alignment, the front direction means longitudinal TTC is dominant. The increasing trend of TTClong over recent timesteps slightly mitigates the risk but still requires attention.
    - Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 3
    - Lateral Time Safety Score: 0
    - Overall Time Safety Score: 3.0 (3 * 1.0 + 0 * (1-1.0) = 3)
    - Overall Risk Score: 2 (0.5 * 1 + 0.5 * 3 = 2)

    - Obstacle ID: 3278
    - Relative Direction: Front-left
    - Distance Risk Reason: DTClong is 10.15m and DTClat is 12.19m, both indicating no distance risk. The obstacle maintains a safe distance and its trajectory suggests no immediate risk of collision.
    - Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 5
    - Lateral Distance Safety Score: 5
    - Overall Distance Safety Score: 5.0 (5 * 0.5 + 5 * (1 - 0.5) = 5)
    - Time Risk Reason: TTClong is 114.57s and TTClat is inf, both confirming no time-related risk. The obstacle's motion and distance suggest no potential collision in the foreseeable future.
    - Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 5
    - Lateral Time Safety Score: 5
    - Overall Time Safety Score: 5.0 (5 * 0.5 + 5 * (1 - 0.5) = 5)
    - Overall Risk Score: 5 (0.5 * 5 + 0.5 * 5 = 5)
