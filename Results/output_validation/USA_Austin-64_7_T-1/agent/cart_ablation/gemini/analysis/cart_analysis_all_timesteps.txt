Here's the collision risk analysis:

**Obstacle 3332:** This obstacle appears at 3.4 seconds and remains stationary far from the ego vehicle's trajectory.  It poses no immediate risk. *Risk Score: 5*

**Obstacle 3334:** This obstacle is stationary and located in a different lanelet (464) than the ego vehicle (462). Although moderately close, it presents no immediate danger. *Risk Score: 4*

**Obstacle 3335:** Similar to 3334, this obstacle is stationary in a different lanelet (465) and does not pose a risk. *Risk Score: 5*

**Obstacle 3336:** This obstacle appears at 4.1 seconds, stationary and far from the ego vehicle, posing no risk. *Risk Score: 5*

**Obstacle 3337:** This obstacle is in a different lanelet (461) and moving slower than the ego vehicle and its trajectory doesn't intersect the ego vehicle. *Risk Score: 4*

**Obstacle 3338:** This obstacle is in the same lanelet (462) as the ego vehicle.  It is moving slower than the ego vehicle, and the ego vehicle is decelerating. Further analysis is required to be certain but it is possible the vehicles could collide. *Risk Score: 2*

**Obstacle 3340:** This obstacle, located in lanelet 461, is moving slower than the ego vehicle in the adjacent lanelet.  There is no apparent risk of collision. *Risk Score: 4*
