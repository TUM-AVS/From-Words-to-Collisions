Obstacle 3332.0 is far from the ego vehicle and poses no risk.  Obstacle 3334.0 and 3335.0 are also relatively far and stationary, presenting negligible risk. Obstacle 3337.0 is in a different lane and moving away from the ego vehicle, posing no immediate risk. Obstacle 3340.0 is also in a different lane, although moving slightly closer; however, there is enough lateral separation to be considered low risk.

Obstacle 3338.0 is in the same lane as the ego vehicle and moving slightly slower. The distance between them is decreasing over time.  While a collision isn't imminent in the next second or two, the closing distance and similar headings warrants a higher risk assessment. Given the current rate of deceleration of both vehicles, obstacle 3338.0 poses a high risk of collision.
