### Analysis:

1. **Ego Vehicle (3339.0)**:
   - Final Position at 4.1s: (483.2035, 373.6012)
   - Speed has been consistently decreasing, down to 3.36 m/s from an initial 7.9323 m/s.
   - Vehicle shows deceleration and a decrease in velocity, indicating a stopping or slowing maneuver.

2. **Obstacle 3338.0** (Highest Risk):
   - Final Position at 4.1s: (484.7428, 378.3472)
   - Same lanelet as the Ego (462.0).
   - Relative Motion: While it is moving slower than the ego and maneuvering away slightly, its proximity in the same lane presents a risk.
   - Overall Risk Score: **3** (Medium Risk).

3. **Obstacle 3337.0**:
   - Final Position at 4.1s: (481.5116, 379.7238)
   - Ego and obstacle are converging, but not in the same lanelet.
   - Relative speed differences may cause an issue later but not immediate.
   - Overall Risk Score: **3** (Medium Risk).

4. **Obstacles in Lanelets 1154 and 1155** (3332.0, 3336.0):
   - Stationary and located far from the ego on inactive lanelets, hence negligible risk.

5. **Stationary Obstacles (3334.0, 3335.0) in Lanelets 464.0, 465.0**:
   - Positions: (484.4801, 388.8699), (487.8118, 387.7994)
   - Stationary and distant, posing no immediate risk despite being nearby.

Overall, the risk from traffic based on relative velocity, same lane presence, and braking behavior of impacted vehicles are manageable. Though close in proximity, no obstacles demand extreme alertness due to adequate separation and velocity favoring a controlled environment.
