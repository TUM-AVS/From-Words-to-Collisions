To perform the collision analysis, let's evaluate the situation at the most recent timestep, which is 4.1 seconds. We'll consider the distance and velocity of the ego vehicle relative to each obstacle.

At 4.1 seconds:
- **Ego Vehicle**: Position (483.2035, 373.6012), Velocity 3.36 m/s, Orientation near 1.256

#### Analysis per Obstacle at 4.1 seconds:

1. **Obstacle 3332.0**:
   - Static, far-off position at (500.6189, 393.3831)
   - Negligible risk.

2. **Obstacle 3334.0**:
   - Static, position at (484.4801, 388.8699)
   - Located in lanelet 464.0, slightly ahead and to the right in a different lane.
   - Negligible risk.

3. **Obstacle 3335.0**:
   - Static, position at (487.8118, 387.7994)
   - Far ahead and in another lane.
   - Negligible risk.

4. **Obstacle 3336.0**:
   - Static, far-off position at (501.8163, 396.6737)
   - Negligible risk.

5. **Obstacle 3337.0**:
   - Moving, position at (481.5116, 379.7238)
   - Relative lateral distance: approximately 6.1 m (373.6012 to 379.7238)
   - Current position very close, potentially impacting trajectory.
   - Moving at 1.8614 m/s, but not in ego's immediate path.
   - Medium risk. Urgent system attention could be needed if trajectory converges further.

6. **Obstacle 3338.0**:
   - Moving, position at (484.7428, 378.3472)
   - Within same lanelet 462.0 and close in proximity.
   - Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC) is decreasing.
   - Relative lateral distance: approximately 4.7 m.
   - High risk if trajectories align; urgent action may be needed.

7. **Obstacle 3340.0**:
   - Moving, position at (477.8769, 368.4687)
   - Behind the ego vehicle by approximately 5.3 m.
   - Leverages braking as it decelerates.
   - Low risk for collisions.

Based on the above analysis, let's focus on the high-risk obstacles.

### JSON Output
```json
{
    "CollisionObstacles": [],
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {},
    "HighRiskObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "3338.0",
        "OverallRiskScore": 2
    }
}
```
This analysis concludes that obstacle 3338.0 poses a high risk due to its proximity and shared lanelet with the ego vehicle. Urgent attention is required to avoid possible collision as their paths converge.
