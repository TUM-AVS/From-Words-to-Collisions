At t=4.1s, Obstacle 3338 is at a longitudinal distance of 0.48m and closing at -1.24 m/s with a small positive acceleration.  This obstacle represents an extreme risk. Obstacle 3337 is also very close at 0.79m longitudinally, but further away laterally (1.89m) with a slower closing velocity. This represents a high risk. All other obstacles are much further away longitudinally and pose less immediate risks.

Risk Levels:
0: Collision - Physical contact occurred or unavoidable
1: Extreme Risk - Immediate collision likely
2: High Risk - Close to collision, needs quick action
3: Medium Risk - Manageable with proper reaction
4: Low Risk - Minimal risk, sufficient time to react
5: Negligible Risk - No significant risk
