### Safety analysis for timestep 4.1s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

First, we need to clarify how adjusted distances (`adjusted_d_long`, `adjusted_d_lat`) are calculated.  Since this information isn't provided, we'll assume a simplified model:  `adjusted_d = real_distance - vehicle_size/2`.  Due to the lack of vehicle size information, I will further assume a vehicle size of 1.5 meters in both longitudinal and lateral directions, so `vehicle_size/2 = 0.75m` will be subtracted from each real distance. This is a crucial step, as real distances alone can be misleading if they don't account for vehicle dimensions.



**Calculations and Risk Assessments:**

For each obstacle, we'll determine TTC (Time to Collision) using a simplified constant velocity model: `TTC = adjusted_d / relative_velocity`.  If acceleration is significant, this model becomes less accurate. We will assess the TTC and MDC in both longitudinal and lateral directions.

**Obstacle Analysis:**

- **Obstacle ID: 3332**
    - Distance Risk reason:  Adjusted distance is large, object is far in front-right.
    - Distance safety score: 5
    - Time Risk reason: Large TTC, no immediate risk.
    - Time safety score: 5
    - Overall Risk score: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 3334**
    - Distance Risk reason: Adjusted distance is large, object is far in front-left.
    - Distance safety score: 5
    - Time Risk reason: Large TTC, no immediate risk.
    - Time safety score: 5
    - Overall Risk score: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 3335**
    - Distance Risk reason: Adjusted distance is large, object is far in front.
    - Distance safety score: 5
    - Time Risk reason: Large TTC, no immediate risk.
    - Time safety score: 5
    - Overall Risk score: 5


- **Obstacle ID: 3336**
    - Distance Risk reason: Adjusted distance is large, object is far in front-right.
    - Distance safety score: 5
    - Time Risk reason: Large TTC, no immediate risk.
    - Time safety score: 5
    - Overall Risk score: 5


- **Obstacle ID: 3337**
    - Distance Risk reason: Adjusted longitudinal distance is (0.79 - 0.75) = 0.04m, indicating extreme risk. Adjusted lateral distance is also minimal.  Object is very close in front-left.
    - Distance safety score: 1
    - Time Risk reason:  TTC is small indicating extreme risk.
    - Time safety score: 1
    - Overall Risk score: 1

- **Obstacle ID: 3338**
    - Distance Risk reason: Adjusted longitudinal distance is (0.48 - 0.75) = -0.27, collision is unavoidable.  Adjusted lateral distance is also minimal. Object is very close to the front.
    - Distance safety score: 0
    - Time Risk reason: Small TTC, collision likely.
    - Time safety score: 0
    - Overall Risk score: 0

- **Obstacle ID: 3340**
    - Distance Risk reason:  Object is moving away longitudinally (behind the ego vehicle) but adjusted lateral distance is small, still a potential risk.
    - Distance safety score: 4
    - Time Risk reason: Not applicable longitudinally as it is moving away.  Laterally TTC is small, represents risk.
    - Time safety score: 3
    - Overall Risk score: 3
