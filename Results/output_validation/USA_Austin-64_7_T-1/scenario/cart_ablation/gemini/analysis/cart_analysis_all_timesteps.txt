At t=4.3s, Ego (3339.0) is at (483.4154, 374.2519) with velocity 2.8065 m/s. Let's analyze the closest obstacles:

- **Obstacle 3338.0:** Located at (484.863, 378.7181) in the same lanelet (462.0) as Ego.  Its velocity is 1.8368 m/s. The x-coordinates are close, and the y-coordinate difference is concerning. Given the small difference in velocity, and decreasing acceleration of both Ego and Obstacle 3338, a collision is highly probable in the next few timesteps if both vehicles maintain current trajectories.  This is an *Extreme Risk*.

- **Obstacle 3334.0:** Static obstacle at (484.4801, 388.8699). Although y-coordinate difference is significant enough for current moment, the decreasing velocity of Ego and its position relative to obstacle 3334 gives high probability of collision in the future.  The static nature and position relative to Ego's trajectory makes this a *High Risk*.

- **Obstacle 3335.0:**  Static obstacle at (487.8118, 387.7994). Similar to Obstacle 3334.0. Its position relative to Ego's trajectory raises concern for *Medium Risk*. This obstacle warrants monitoring, as it represents a potential future risk.

- **Obstacle 3337.0:** Located at (481.6166, 380.048) in lanelet 461.  Low relative velocity 1.6253 m/s. While a collision is possible, a simple lane change would significantly reduce or avoid collision risk.  Still a *Medium Risk*.

Other obstacles are far enough to be of negligible risk at this moment.

    "Reasoning": "Obstacle 3338.0 poses an extreme risk due to its close proximity and  relative motion to the Ego vehicle in the same lane. Obstacle 3334.0 and 3335.0 and 3337.0 present as high to medium risk due to relative position on the road and Ego's trajectory.  No immediate collision detected."
