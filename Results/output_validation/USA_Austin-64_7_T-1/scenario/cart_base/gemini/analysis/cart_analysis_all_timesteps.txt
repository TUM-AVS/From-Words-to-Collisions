At t=4.3s, Ego (3339.0) is in lanelet 462.0 at (483.4154, 374.2519) with a velocity of 2.8065 m/s.

Obstacle 3338.0 is also in lanelet 462.0 at (484.863, 378.7181) with a velocity of 1.8368 m/s. The x-coordinates suggest a potential collision risk as they are very close and Ego's x-coordinate is increasing more rapidly than Obstacle 3338.0's due to greater velocity.  The difference in y-coordinates is larger and the trajectories, based on previous timesteps, suggest Obstacle 3338.0 might be moving further away in the y-direction, therefore its not an immediate collision risk. Considering Ego's decreasing velocity and Obstacle 3338.0's proximity, this represents an extreme risk if Ego does not continue decelerating. Thus, Obstacle 3338.0 is assigned an extreme risk score of 1.

Other obstacles are in different lanelets and/or sufficiently far away to pose lower risks, so are not analyzed individually.
