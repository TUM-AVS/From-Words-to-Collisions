### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:

- Obstacle ID: 3332.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is far from the ego vehicle and in a different lanelet (1154 vs 462).  History shows it remains stationary.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Obstacle is stationary, posing no immediate time-related risk. History confirms this.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 3334.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is moderately far from the ego vehicle and in a different lanelet (464 vs 462). History shows it remains stationary.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Obstacle is stationary, posing no immediate time-related risk. History confirms this.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 4

- Obstacle ID: 3335.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is moderately far from the ego vehicle and in a different lanelet (465 vs 462). History shows it remains stationary.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Obstacle is stationary, posing no immediate time-related risk. History confirms this.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 4

- Obstacle ID: 3336.0
- Distance Risk reason: This obstacle appears at the last timestep and is relatively far from the ego vehicle and in a different lanelet.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Obstacle is stationary, posing no immediate time-related risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 3337.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is in a different lanelet (461 vs 462) and maintains a safe lateral distance. The history shows a decreasing velocity, further reducing risk.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason:  While the obstacle is moving, its velocity is decreasing, and it's in a different lane. History shows it's not on a collision course.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- Obstacle ID: 3338.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is in the same lanelet (462) as the ego vehicle but maintains a safe longitudinal distance.  History shows this distance decreasing but still safe at the most recent timestep, but may become a concern soon.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: Obstacle is moving slower than the ego vehicle, and both are decelerating.  History reveals a closing velocity which raises moderate concerns, with decreasing speeds helping somewhat.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3

- Obstacle ID: 3340.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is in a different lanelet (461 vs 462). History consistently shows safe separation.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Although moving, the obstacle maintains a safe trajectory in a different lane.  History confirms this.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4



### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. **Most critical obstacle:** Obstacle 3338.0 is the most critical as it's in the same lane and closest to the ego vehicle.
2. **Trajectory analysis:** Over the 10 timesteps, obstacle 3338.0 consistently remains in the same lane as the ego vehicle, with the distance between them decreasing but with still safe distances in the final timestamp.
3. **Relative position, velocity, and acceleration:** The ego vehicle is behind obstacle 3338 and approaching it. Both are decelerating but ego vehicle's speed is currently higher. This closing velocity is the primary concern with 3338 being the closest obstacle
4. **Collision determination:** At the latest timestep (4.3 seconds), no collision has occurred.  While the scenario isn't an immediate collision, it does warrant attention.
5. **Reasoning:** Although no collision is imminent at 4.3 seconds, the decreasing distance and closing speed between the ego vehicle and obstacle 3338.0 require monitoring. If these trends continue, a collision could occur in the near future.


### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
  "CollisionObstacles": [],
  "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null,
  "ScenarioAnalysis": {
    "IsCollisionScenario": false,
    "Reasoning": "No collision has occurred at the most recent timestep (4.3 seconds).  However, obstacle 3338.0 in the same lanelet poses the highest risk due to the decreasing distance and closing velocity. Continued monitoring is necessary as the situation could evolve into a collision if these trends persist."
