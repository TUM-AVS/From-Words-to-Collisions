- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: Obstacle is moving slower than ego and decelerating.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3

- Obstacle ID: 3340.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is in a different lanelet, behind, and moving away from the ego vehicle.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Though moving faster than ego initially, it's decelerating and poses no immediate threat.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4


### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
No obstacle poses an immediate collision risk. Obstacle 3338 is in the same lane and closest, but maintains a safe distance and is decelerating. Therefore, this is not a collision scenario.
