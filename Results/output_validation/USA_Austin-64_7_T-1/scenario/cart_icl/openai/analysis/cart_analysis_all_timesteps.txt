- **Time Risk Reason:** No indication of motion or change in position.
- **Time Safety Score:** 5
- **Overall Risk Score:** 5

**Obstacle ID: 3337.0**
- **Distance Risk Reason:** This obstacle's position (481.6166, 380.048) is close to the ego vehicle, but still positioned behind it.
- **Distance Safety Score:** 4
- **Time Risk Reason:** Slowly decelerating, but its motion is away from the ego vehicle and decreasing over time.
- **Time Safety Score:** 4
- **Overall Risk Score:** 4

**Obstacle ID: 3338.0**
- **Distance Risk Reason:** Located within the same lanelet as the ego vehicle and presents slight proximity at (484.863, 378.7181). Its decreasing velocity and position indicate a widening gap.
- **Distance Safety Score:** 4
- **Time Risk Reason:** The obstacle is decelerating. The trend suggests diverging paths from the ego vehicle.
- **Time Safety Score:** 4
- **Overall Risk Score:** 4

**Obstacle ID: 3340.0**
- **Distance Risk Reason:** This obstacle is moving in the opposite direction or away, with a continued decline in velocity and located at (478.0868, 369.1186).
- **Distance Safety Score:** 5
- **Time Risk Reason:** Consistent movement away from ego vehicle and steady deceleration.
- **Time Safety Score:** 5
- **Overall Risk Score:** 5

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
When evaluating the current conditions, no obstacles present a collision or extreme risk to the ego vehicle. All obstacles are either stationary far outside the trajectory of the ego vehicle or moving away. The motion trends over the past timesteps suggest increasing distances over time.
