Obstacle 3338 is at high risk of collision with the ego vehicle. It is located directly in front of the ego vehicle at a very close longitudinal distance of 0.19 meters, with a relative longitudinal velocity indicating it is approaching the ego vehicle. While the lateral relative motion is minimal (0.00 m/s), the small longitudinal distance poses a significant and immediate threat.

Obstacle 3337 is also at high risk.  It is in the front-left of the ego with a longitudinal distance of 0.45 meters and closing.  While the lateral motion suggests it might be moving slightly away, the primary concern is the short longitudinal distance. This obstacle requires immediate attention to avoid collision.
