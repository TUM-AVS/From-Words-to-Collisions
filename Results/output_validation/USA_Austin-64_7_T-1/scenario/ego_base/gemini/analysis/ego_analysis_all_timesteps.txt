At t=4.3s, Obstacle 3338 is at a longitudinal distance of 0.19m and lateral distance of 0.00m relative to the ego vehicle, with a longitudinal relative velocity of -0.97 m/s. This indicates the obstacle is very close to the ego vehicle and approaching it longitudinally.  Although the relative velocity is not very high, the proximity makes this a high-risk situation.  Obstacle 3337 is also quite close at 0.45m longitudinally, but its lateral distance of 1.89m suggests slightly less immediate risk than 3338. Obstacle 3340 is behind the ego vehicle and moving away longitudinally, posing negligible risk. All other obstacles are further away and do not represent an immediate threat.

**Risk Levels and Definitions:**
<Collision (Score: 0)>: Actual collision has occurred or is unavoidable within the next timestep.
<Extreme Risk (Score: 1)>: Immediate collision or very high likelihood of impact. Urgent action is required.
<High Risk (Score: 2)>: Close to collision or highly probable collision path. Needs prompt attention and quick manoeuvring.
<Medium Risk (Score: 3)>: Moderate collision risk but manageable with timely reactions and proper strategies.
<Low Risk (Score: 4)>: Minimal collision risk. The situation is controllable with sufficient time to react.
<Negligible Risk (Score: 5)>: No significant collision risk. Obstacles are either moving away or far enough not to interfere.

  "ScenarioAnalysis": {
    "IsCollisionScenario": false,
    "Reasoning": "Obstacle 3338 poses an extreme risk due to its very close proximity to the ego vehicle (0.19m longitudinal distance) and its longitudinal relative velocity towards the ego car (-0.97m/s). While no collision is imminent in the next timestep, the situation demands immediate attention to avoid an imminent impact. Other obstacles pose less immediate risks."
