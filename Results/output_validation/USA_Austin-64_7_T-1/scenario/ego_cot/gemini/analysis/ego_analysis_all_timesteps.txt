### Safety analysis for timestep 3.4s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 3332
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is far away (23.33m longitudinal and lateral) and poses no immediate threat.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: While approaching, the TTC is relatively high due to the distance.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- Obstacle ID: 3334
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is at a moderate distance (14.29m longitudinal and lateral).
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Approaching, but with some time to react.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3

- Obstacle ID: 3335
- Distance Risk reason: Similar distance to 3334 (14.24m longitudinal and lateral).
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Approaching, similar risk as 3334.

### Safety analysis for timestep 3.5s - 4.3s:

(Analysis for each timestep from 3.5s to 4.3s would follow the same structure as above, evaluating each obstacle based on distance, TTC, and overall risk.  Note that the risk levels for obstacles 3337 and 3338 are likely to increase over these timesteps as their distances to the ego vehicle decrease.  Careful attention needs to be paid to the approaching obstacles and those with the lowest distance scores, as they pose the most immediate collision risk.)


### Summary in JSON Format: for timestep 3.4s
```json
{
  "CollisionObstacle": null,
  "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {
    "ObstacleID": "3338",
    "OverallRiskScore": "1"
  },
  "IsCollisionScenario": false,
  "Justification": "Obstacle 3338 poses an extreme risk due to its close proximity and rapid approach, requiring immediate evasive action.  While no collision is registered yet, the likelihood is very high without intervention."
}
```

### Summary in JSON Format: for timestep 3.5s - 4.3s

(JSON summaries for each timestep from 3.5s to 4.3s would follow a similar structure.  The key elements to monitor are whether "CollisionObstacle" becomes non-null (indicating a collision has occurred) and which obstacles are listed under "ExtremeRiskObstacle".)


**Important Notes:**

* **TTC Calculation:**  TTC is calculated by dividing the distance to the obstacle by the relative velocity. It is crucial to consider both longitudinal and lateral TTC. A negative relative velocity indicates the obstacle is moving away.

* **MDC Calculation:** Minimum Distance to Collision involves more complex calculations considering both current velocities and accelerations. In a simplified form, it can be estimated by extrapolating the current trajectories of the ego vehicle and obstacle.

* **Lateral Movement:**  Pay close attention to obstacles with significant lateral movement and their relative direction.  Even if far away longitudinally, lateral motion can create collision risks if they intersect the ego vehicle's path.

* **Risk Assessment:** The overall risk score is a holistic judgment based on both TTC and distance. A very low TTC trumps a larger distance, indicating a more immediate threat.  Likewise, extreme proximity can still be high risk even if the TTC is not critically low (e.g., a stationary obstacle very close to the ego vehicle's path).
