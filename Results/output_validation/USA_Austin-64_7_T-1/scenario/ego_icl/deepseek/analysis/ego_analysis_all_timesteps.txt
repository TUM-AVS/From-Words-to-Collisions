Let me analyze the most recent timestep (4.3 seconds) with trajectory context from previous timesteps:

Obstacle-by-Obstacle Analysis:

1. Obstacle 3332 (Front-right):
   - Adjusted distance: longitudinal 19.00m, lateral -8.85m
   - Relative velocity: longitudinal -2.81m/s (approaching), lateral 0.00m/s
   - MDC: 8.85m (lateral distance)
   - TTC: longitudinal 19.00/2.81 = 6.76s
   - Risk: 5 (No Risk) - Large distances in both dimensions

2. Obstacle 3334 (Front-left):
   - Adjusted distance: longitudinal 9.72m, lateral 1.89m
   - Relative velocity: longitudinal -2.81m/s, lateral 0.00m/s
   - MDC: 1.89m (lateral distance)
   - TTC: longitudinal 9.72/2.81 = 3.46s
   - Risk: 4 (Low Risk) - Moderate longitudinal approach

3. Obstacle 3335 (Front):
   - Adjusted distance: longitudinal 9.74m, lateral 0.00m
   - Relative velocity: longitudinal -2.81m/s, lateral 0.00m/s
   - MDC: 9.74m (longitudinal distance)
   - TTC: longitudinal 9.74/2.81 = 3.47s
   - Risk: 4 (Low Risk) - Same lane but safe distance

4. Obstacle 3336 (Front-right):
   - Adjusted distance: longitudinal 22.50m, lateral -8.97m
   - Relative velocity: longitudinal -2.81m/s, lateral 0.00m/s
   - MDC: 8.97m (lateral distance)
   - TTC: longitudinal 22.50/2.81 = 8.01s
   - Risk: 5 (No Risk) - Very large distances

5. Obstacle 3337 (Front-left):
   - Adjusted distance: longitudinal 0.45m, lateral 1.89m
   - Relative velocity: longitudinal -1.18m/s (approaching), lateral 0.00m/s
   - MDC: 0.45m (longitudinal distance)
   - TTC: longitudinal 0.45/1.18 = 0.38s
   - Risk: 1 (Extreme Risk) - Very close longitudinally with imminent collision time

6. Obstacle 3338 (Front):
   - Adjusted distance: longitudinal 0.19m, lateral 0.00m
   - Relative velocity: longitudinal -0.97m/s, lateral 0.00m/s
   - MDC: 0.19m (longitudinal distance)
   - TTC: longitudinal 0.19/0.97 = 0.20s
   - Risk: 0 (Collision) - Essentially touching longitudinally with same-lane alignment

7. Obstacle 3340 (Rear-left):
   - Adjusted distance: longitudinal -2.02m, lateral 1.87m
   - Relative velocity: longitudinal 0.51m/s (moving away), lateral 0.00m/s
   - MDC: 1.87m (lateral distance)
   - TTC: N/A (moving away)
   - Risk: 5 (No Risk) - Moving away in both dimensions

Trajectory Analysis:
- Obstacle 3338 shows consistent longitudinal approach from 2.42m at 3.4s to 0.19m at 4.3s
- Obstacle 3337 shows rapid longitudinal approach from 3.02m to 0.45m in same period
- Both are maintaining exact lateral alignment (0.00m) indicating same-lane travel
- Relative velocities are decreasing but still substantial
