Here's the collision risk analysis:

**Obstacle 3325:** This obstacle is moving towards the ego vehicle's lane, but maintains a safe lateral distance. Although the distance decreases over time, it doesn't pose an immediate collision risk.  Risk score: 3 (Medium Risk) initially, increasing to 4 (Low Risk) as the lateral distance stabilizes.

**Obstacle 3327:**  Similar to 3325, this obstacle is in a different lane, but its trajectory and speed don't present an immediate threat. It requires monitoring. Risk score: 4 (Low Risk)

**Obstacle 3336:**  This obstacle is moving away from the ego vehicle and poses no risk. Risk score: 5 (Negligible Risk)

**Obstacle 3337:** Stationary and far from the ego vehicle's trajectory.  Risk score: 5 (Negligible Risk)

**Obstacle 3339:**  Stationary and far from the ego vehicle's trajectory.  Risk score: 5 (Negligible Risk)

**Obstacle 3349:** This obstacle is the most concerning. It's in a neighboring lane and its trajectory shows a potential convergence with the ego vehicle's path in the near future. Its relatively high speed increases the collision risk. Risk score: 2 (High Risk) initially, increasing to 1 (Extreme Risk) by 5.8 seconds as its future trajectory projects a possible collision with the ego vehicle.

**Obstacle 3359:** Stationary and far from the ego vehicle's trajectory. Risk score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
