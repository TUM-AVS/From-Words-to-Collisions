Obstacle 3325: This obstacle starts relatively far from the ego vehicle but gradually gets closer over the timesteps.  Its trajectory indicates a potential lane change towards the ego vehicle's lane. While not an immediate collision risk, the closing distance and potential lane change warrant a high-risk assessment.

Obstacle 3327: Similar to Obstacle 3325, this one also exhibits a decreasing distance to the ego vehicle, increasing the risk of a collision over the time horizon.  The lane changes observed throughout the provided timesteps further emphasize the need to monitor this obstacle closely. It's classified as a high risk.

Obstacle 3336: This obstacle is moving faster than the ego vehicle and is located behind it. The distance between them is increasing. Hence, it poses a negligible risk.

Obstacle 3337: This obstacle is stationary and far from the ego vehicle's trajectory, presenting no immediate risk.

Obstacle 3339:  This obstacle is also stationary and relatively far from the ego vehicle's trajectory. Thus, it has a negligible risk.

Obstacle 3349: Initially distant, this obstacle shows a rapidly decreasing distance to the ego vehicle over the timesteps. It represents a potential risk. Its trajectory suggests a possible lane change or merging scenario that could lead to a collision if not addressed. High risk.

Obstacle 3359: This obstacle is stationary and far from the ego vehicle, therefore posing negligible risk.
