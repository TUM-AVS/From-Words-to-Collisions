Obstacle 3349 shows concerning behavior. In the last provided timestep (5.8 seconds), its position is (348.7212, 306.8494) while the ego vehicle's position is (347.0567, 301.731).  This places them very close together.  Additionally, obstacle 3349's velocity is 11.6583 while the ego vehicle's velocity is only 5.8749, heading in roughly the same direction based on the provided orientations. The relatively large velocity difference combined with close proximity suggests a possible imminent collision if the vehicles maintain their current trajectories. A precise TTC calculation is difficult without more detailed information about future timesteps but appears likely to be very low.  MDC is also likely to be quite small given their current positions.
