Based on the most recent timestep at 5.8 seconds, here's an analysis of the possible collision risks:

1. **Ego Vehicle (ID: 3363.0)**
   - Position: (347.0567, 301.731)
   - Heading: -1.8805 radians
   - Velocity: 5.8749 m/s

2. **Obstacle: 3325.0**
   - Position: (345.5633, 319.8716)
   - Heading: -1.8826 radians
   - Velocity: 8.0898 m/s
   - This obstacle is moving along a different lanelet and appears to have a larger Y-coordinate, moving parallel or away from the ego vehicle. The relative trajectories and lanes make a collision unlikely.

3. **Obstacle: 3327.0**
   - Position: (347.64, 314.9123)
   - Heading: -1.8822 radians
   - Velocity: 9.5921 m/s
   - It is ahead of the ego vehicle but far separated vertically. Given different lanelets and unused connecting trajectory points, collision is unlikely.

4. **Obstacle: 3336.0**
   - Position: (334.6234, 286.0311)
   - Heading: -1.8838 radians
   - Velocity: 12.346 m/s
   - This obstacle is positioned behind and towards the side of the ego vehicle. Velocity differential may lead it to converge, but it appears in a different lanelet.

5. **Obstacle: 3337.0**
   - Position: (340.4093, 327.892)
   - Stationary and positioned considerably apart from the ego vehicle both in X and Y directions.
   - No immediate threat detected.

6. **Obstacle: 3349.0**
   - Position: (348.7212, 306.8494)
   - Heading: -1.8829 radians
   - Velocity: 11.6583 m/s
   - Located in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle and moving relatively fast. This obstacle is directly positioned ahead of the ego vehicle and poses a high risk of leading to collision. Time to Collision (TTC) is low given velocity and proximity, and based on the positions, a Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC) could be low if velocities remain.

7. **Obstacle: 3359.0**
   - Position: (341.522, 331.2138)
   - Practically stationary with minimal velocity.
   - Separated in Y direction substantially, unlikely to intersect paths with the ego vehicle.

Given this information, the highest risk comes from obstacle 3349.0 due to its lane position with the ego and high relative speed.

    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "3349.0",

        "ObstacleID": "3336.0",

    }
}
```

Note: No obstacles reached 0 risk since physical contact or certainty of collision did not arise within the immediate trajectory qualification based on position.
