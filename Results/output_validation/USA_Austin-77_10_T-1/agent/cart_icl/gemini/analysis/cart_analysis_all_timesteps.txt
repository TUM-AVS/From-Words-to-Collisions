Obstacle 3349 is showing concerning behavior. In the last provided timestep (5.8 seconds), it is approaching the ego vehicle's rear with a relatively high closing velocity.  It has moved into the ego vehicle's lanelet (797). This requires close monitoring or immediate action to avoid a collision. It's closing velocity and lane change suggest an elevated risk.

Obstacle 3325 is also a concern, its lateral distance is decreasing and based on its lanelet changes and velocity it seems to be changing lanes into the ego vehicle's path. Although not as immediately concerning as obstacle 3349, it requires attention.
