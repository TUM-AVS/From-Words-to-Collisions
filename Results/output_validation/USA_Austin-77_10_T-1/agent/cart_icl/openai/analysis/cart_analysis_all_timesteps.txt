To evaluate the scenario at the most recent timestamp (5.8 seconds), we analyze the relative positions and motions of the obstacles in comparison to the ego vehicle.

### Evaluation of Each Obstacle:

1. **Obstacle 3325.0**:
   - Position: (345.5633, 319.8716)
   - Relative to Ego: Approximately 19 meters away longitudinally.
   - Dynamics: Moving away from the ego vehicle with a compatible velocity direction.
   - Risk Level: 4 (Low Risk)

2. **Obstacle 3327.0**:
   - Position: (347.64, 314.9123)
   - Relative to Ego: Approximately 13 meters away longitudinally.
   - Recent Acceleration: 2.3727 m/sÂ² suggests increased distance in subsequent seconds.
   - Risk Level: 4 (Low Risk)

3. **Obstacle 3336.0**:
   - Position: (334.6234, 286.0311)
   - Relative to Ego: Approximately over 15 meters behind.
   - Dynamics: With a high velocity away from ego's path.
   - Risk Level: 5 (Negligible Risk)

4. **Obstacle 3337.0**:
   - Position: (340.4093, 327.892)
   - Relative to Ego: Static and off-direction.
   - Dynamics: Stationary object nearly parallel to the ego, not on a collision course.
   - Risk Level: 5 (Negligible Risk)

5. **Obstacle 3349.0**:
   - Position: (348.7212, 306.8494)
   - Relative to Ego: Very close longitudinally, in the same lanelet, suggesting a merging course.
   - Dynamics: High risk due to decreasing distance, lateral proximity to ego.
   - Risk Level: 1 (Extreme Risk)

6. **Obstacle 3359.0**:
   - Position: (341.522, 331.2138)
   - Relative to Ego: Very far laterally.
   - Dynamics: Almost static with respect to ego's lateral and longitudinal heading.
   - Risk Level: 5 (Negligible Risk)

Overall, obstacle 3349.0 presents an extreme risk due to its close proximity and the fact that it is in the same lanelet as the ego, suggesting a potential merging conflict.
