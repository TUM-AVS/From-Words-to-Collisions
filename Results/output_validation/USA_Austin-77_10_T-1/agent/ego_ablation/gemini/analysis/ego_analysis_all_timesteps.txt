At the most recent timestep (5.8 seconds), the following analysis applies:

* **Obstacle 3325:** Rear-right with longitudinal distance -12.31m and lateral distance -5.34m. Moving away longitudinally and slightly away laterally.  This obstacle poses negligible risk. Proximity (5), MDC (5), TTC (5).

* **Obstacle 3327:** Rear-right with longitudinal distance -8.22m and lateral distance -1.85m. Driving towards the ego car longitudinally and slightly away laterally. This obstacle has a medium risk due to its proximity. Proximity (3), MDC (4), TTC (3).

* **Obstacle 3336:** Front-right with longitudinal distance 14.23m and lateral distance -5.45m. Moving away both longitudinally and laterally. This obstacle poses negligible risk. Proximity (5), MDC (5), TTC (5).

* **Obstacle 3337:** Rear-right, longitudinal distance -18.38m and lateral distance -12.69m. Moving away longitudinally. Negligible risk. Proximity (5), MDC (5), TTC (5).

* **Obstacle 3339:** Rear-right with longitudinal distance -21.89m and lateral distance -12.65m. Moving away longitudinally. Negligible risk. Proximity (5), MDC (5), TTC (5).

* **Obstacle 3349:** Behind the ego car with longitudinal distance -0.87m. Driving towards the ego car from behind. This obstacle poses an extreme risk due to its very close proximity and high closing velocity. Proximity (1), MDC (1), TTC (1).

* **Obstacle 3359:** Rear-right with longitudinal distance -21.89m and lateral distance -12.65m. Moving away longitudinally. Negligible risk. Proximity (5), MDC (5), TTC (5).
