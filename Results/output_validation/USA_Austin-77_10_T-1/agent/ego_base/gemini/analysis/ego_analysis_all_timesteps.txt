Obstacle 3337: Rear-right, longitudinal distance -18.38m, moving away from ego car at -5.87 m/s.  Lateral distance -12.69, no lateral relative motion. Low risk (5).

Obstacle 3349: Behind, longitudinal distance -0.87m, rapidly approaching ego car at 5.78 m/s.  At or near exact lateral alignment. Extremely high risk of collision (1).

Obstacle 3359: Rear-right, longitudinal distance -21.89m, moving away from ego at -5.88 m/s. Lateral distance -12.65m, moving towards ego car laterally. Low risk (5).


Risk Levels:
0: Collision - Physical contact occurred or unavoidable
1: Extreme Risk - Immediate collision likely
2: High Risk - Close to collision, needs quick action
3: Medium Risk - Manageable with proper reaction
4: Low Risk - Minimal risk, sufficient time to react
5: Negligible Risk - No significant risk
