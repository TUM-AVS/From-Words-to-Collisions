### Safety analysis for timestep 5.8 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

**Assumptions and Clarifications:**

* Since the provided scenario lacks ego vehicle dimensions and precise obstacle trajectories,  I'll make reasonable assumptions for demonstration purposes.  I will assume a simplified vehicle collision box model (rectangular) and constant relative velocity/acceleration within the small time window of each step for TTC and MDC calculations, understanding this is a simplification.  A real-world system would use more sophisticated prediction models.  
* The provided data uses real distance which needs to be adjusted for vehicle size; I will assume an adjustment of 0.5m in both longitudinal and lateral directions to account for vehicle size, applied symmetrically. As this parameter is not provided we will proceed without exact knowledge of its value. This simplified approach is necessary to work within the bounds of the provided data.
* Lateral movement towards the ego vehicle is considered risky even when longitudinal movement is away, especially at close proximities.
* "Behind," "Front-right," etc., represent the relative direction from the ego vehicle's perspective.
* I'll prioritize TTC for the overall risk score, as it's a more dynamic measure of immediate danger. However, MDC will be heavily factored in, especially for close proximity scenarios.

**Calculations and Reasoning:**

Given the lack of exact trajectories and ego vehicle dimensions, I'll infer TTC and MDC based on the provided relative velocities and distances.  Since the timesteps are very close together (0.1 seconds), we can reasonably approximate TTC and MDC using the most recent data point and assuming constant velocity and acceleration.
