Let's analyze each obstacle at the most recent timestep (5.8 seconds) and assess collision risk:

1. Obstacle 3325 (Rear-right):
   - Adjusted distances: longitudinal -12.31m, lateral -5.34m
   - Relative velocity: longitudinal 2.21 m/s (approaching), lateral -0.02 m/s (moving away)
   - TTC longitudinal: 12.31/2.21 = 5.57s (No Risk)
   - TTC lateral: Not applicable (moving away)
   - MDC: Lateral distance is increasing, longitudinal distance is large
   - Overall Risk: 5 (No Risk)

2. Obstacle 3327 (Rear-right):
   - Adjusted distances: longitudinal -8.22m, lateral -1.85m
   - Relative velocity: longitudinal 3.72 m/s (approaching), lateral -0.02 m/s (moving away)
   - TTC longitudinal: 8.22/3.72 = 2.21s (Medium Risk)
   - TTC lateral: Not applicable (moving away)
   - MDC: Lateral distance is increasing, longitudinal distance is decreasing but still >3m
   - Overall Risk: 3 (Medium Risk)

3. Obstacle 3336 (Front-right):
   - Adjusted distances: longitudinal 14.23m, lateral -5.45m
   - Relative velocity: longitudinal 6.47 m/s (moving away), lateral -0.04 m/s (moving away)
   - TTC longitudinal: Not applicable (moving away)
   - TTC lateral: Not applicable (moving away)
   - Overall Risk: 5 (No Risk)

4. Obstacle 3337 (Rear-right):
   - Adjusted distances: longitudinal -18.38m, lateral -12.69m
   - Relative velocity: longitudinal -5.87 m/s (moving away), lateral 0.00 m/s
   - TTC: Not applicable (moving away)
   - Overall Risk: 5 (No Risk)

5. Obstacle 3349 (Behind):
   - Adjusted distances: longitudinal -0.87m, lateral 0.00m
   - Relative velocity: longitudinal 5.78 m/s (approaching), lateral -0.03 m/s
   - TTC longitudinal: 0.87/5.78 = 0.15s (Extreme Risk)
   - MDC: Lateral alignment (0.00m) with rapidly decreasing longitudinal distance
   - Overall Risk: 1 (Extreme Risk) - This is the most critical obstacle

6. Obstacle 3359 (Rear-right):
   - Adjusted distances: longitudinal -21.89m, lateral -12.65m
   - Relative velocity: longitudinal -5.88 m/s (moving away), lateral 0.12 m/s
   - TTC: Not applicable (moving away longitudinally)
   - Overall Risk: 5 (No Risk)

Critical Findings:
- Obstacle 3349 is at Extreme Risk (Risk 1) with TTC of 0.15s and exact lateral alignment
- No current collision (Risk 0) but Obstacle 3349 is predicted to collide imminently
- Other obstacles either moving away or at safe distances
