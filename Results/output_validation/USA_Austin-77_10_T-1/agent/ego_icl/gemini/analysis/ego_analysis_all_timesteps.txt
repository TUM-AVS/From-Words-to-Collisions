Obstacle 3325: Rear-right, moving away longitudinally, approaching laterally.  Lateral distance is decreasing across timesteps, while longitudinal distance initially increases then decreases. At the last timestep, the longitudinal distance is -12.31m and lateral is -5.34m. Since the lateral distance is smaller and decreasing, it poses the greater risk.  Relative lateral velocity is -0.02 m/s (moving away), so TTC is not applicable in the lateral direction. The risk is considered low (4) due to the lateral distance.

Obstacle 3327: Rear-right, approaching both longitudinally and laterally.  Both distances are decreasing across timesteps.  At the last timestep, longitudinal distance is -8.22m and lateral is -1.85m. Lateral distance is smaller and decreasing, posing the greater risk. Relative lateral velocity is -0.02 m/s (moving away), so TTC is not applicable in the lateral direction.  Considering the lateral distance of 1.85m, the risk is medium (3).

Obstacle 3336: Front-right, moving away longitudinally and laterally. Both distances are increasing across timesteps. At the last timestep, the longitudinal distance is 14.23m and the lateral distance is -5.45m. Both distances indicate no immediate risk, hence negligible risk (5).

Obstacle 3337: Rear-right, moving away longitudinally, no lateral relative motion. The longitudinal distance is increasing, and lateral distance is relatively stable across timesteps. At the last timestep, longitudinal distance is -18.38m and lateral is -12.69m.  Both distances indicate no immediate risk, hence negligible risk (5).

Obstacle 3339: Rear-right, moving away longitudinally, approaching laterally. The lateral distance is decreasing across the timesteps, while longitudinal distance increases. At the last timestep, the longitudinal distance is -14.99m and the lateral distance is -20.9m. Both distances are significantly large, hence negligible risk (5).

Obstacle 3349: Behind, approaching longitudinally, laterally aligned (or near zero). The longitudinal distance is rapidly decreasing across the timesteps, while lateral remains at 0. At the last timestep, longitudinal distance is -0.87m with a relative velocity of 5.78m/s. TTC = 0.87 / 5.78 = 0.15s. MDC is also less than 0.5m. This represents an *extreme risk* (1) of collision.

Obstacle 3359: Rear-right, moving away longitudinally, approaching laterally. The lateral distance is decreasing, while longitudinal distance increases. At the last timestep, longitudinal distance is -21.89m and lateral distance is -12.65m. Both distances indicate no immediate risk, hence negligible risk (5).
