At t=6.0s, ego vehicle (ID 3363) is at (346.6983, 300.6127) in lanelet 797.  Obstacle 3349 is at (347.9919, 304.5935), also in lanelet 797.  The close proximity and shared lanelet indicate a very high risk of collision. Analyzing the trajectories confirms this: both vehicles are moving forward, and obstacle 3349's y-coordinate is converging towards the ego vehicle's y-coordinate. Although the y-coordinates are not yet identical, given the proximity and their relative velocities, a collision is highly likely in the next timestep.  Therefore, obstacle 3349 is assigned an extreme risk score (1).
