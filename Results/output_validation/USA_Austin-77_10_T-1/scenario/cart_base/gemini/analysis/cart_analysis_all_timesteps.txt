At t=6.0s, Obstacle 3349 is in the same lanelet (797) as the Ego vehicle and their positions are very close: (346.6983, 300.6127) for Ego and (347.9919, 304.5935) for Obstacle 3349.  Examining the trajectories from previous timesteps shows both Obstacle 3349 and Ego are moving in roughly the same direction and Obstacle 3349 is approaching Ego rapidly from behind.  This indicates an extremely high risk of collision.
