### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

- Obstacle ID: 3325.0
- Distance Risk reason:  This obstacle started relatively close to the ego vehicle and although it appears to be moving away laterally, its longitudinal velocity is similar to the ego vehicle's. Over the past timesteps, the lateral distance has increased.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason:  The obstacle's longitudinal velocity is consistently close to the ego vehicle's, suggesting a low risk of a rear-end collision. The increasing lateral distance further reduces the risk.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- Obstacle ID: 3327.0
- Distance Risk reason:  This obstacle started somewhat close and has been moving away from the ego vehicle both laterally and longitudinally. The historical data confirms this diverging trajectory.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: The obstacle's velocity is higher than the ego's, and it's moving further away with each timestep, minimizing the risk of collision.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 3336.0
- Distance Risk reason: This obstacle started further behind the ego vehicle and remains significantly behind, posing no immediate threat. It appears to be in a different lane.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: While the obstacle's velocity is higher than the ego vehicle's, its position far behind and in a likely different lane minimizes the risk of collision.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 3337.0
- Distance Risk reason: This stationary obstacle is laterally far from the ego vehicle and does not pose any risk based on the provided data.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: The obstacle is stationary, further eliminating any collision risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 3339.0
- Distance Risk reason:  Similar to 3337.0, this obstacle is also laterally far from the ego and poses no risk.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: While moving, its low velocity and lateral distance from the ego vehicle make a collision unlikely.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 3349.0
- Distance Risk reason: This obstacle poses the most significant risk. It started relatively close, and although it was moving away initially, it is now in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle and rapidly approaching from behind.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: This obstacle is moving considerably faster than the ego vehicle and is closing the distance quickly, increasing the risk of a rear-end collision.  
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3


- Obstacle ID: 3359.0
- Distance Risk reason: This obstacle is laterally separated from the ego vehicle and maintains a safe distance. 
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Its very low velocity and lateral separation minimize any risk of collision.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5


### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:

1. **Most critical obstacle:** Obstacle 3349.0 presents the highest risk due to its high relative velocity, same-lane position, and rapidly decreasing distance to the ego vehicle.

2. **Trajectory analysis:**  Obstacle 3349.0 was initially moving away from the ego but has changed its trajectory over the last few timesteps to move into the ego vehicle's lanelet and approach it from behind.

3. **Relative positions, velocities, and accelerations:** The obstacle is behind the ego vehicle with higher velocity and similar orientation, creating a high probability of a rear-end collision if no evasive action is taken.

4. **Collision determination:** While no collision has occurred yet, the current trajectory and dynamics suggest a high likelihood of an imminent rear-end collision with Obstacle 3349.0.

5. **Reasoning:** The consistent decrease in longitudinal distance between obstacle 3349.0 and the ego vehicle, coupled with the obstacle's higher velocity, indicates a high probability of a rear-end collision within the next few seconds if the current trends continue.
