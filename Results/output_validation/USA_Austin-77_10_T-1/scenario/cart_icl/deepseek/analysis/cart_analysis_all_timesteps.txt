### Safety Analysis for the Most Recent Timestep (6.0 seconds):

#### Key Observations:
1. **Ego Vehicle**: Position (346.6983, 300.6127), velocity 5.466 m/s, decelerating (-1.6128 m/s²)
2. **Obstacles**: Multiple obstacles in various lanelets, with varying velocities and trajectories.

### Obstacle Analysis (Selected Critical Obstacles):

#### Obstacle 3327 (Highest Risk):
- **Position**: (347.0392, 313.0456), velocity 9.9249 m/s (faster than ego)
- **Trajectory**: Moving parallel to ego but at higher speed (closing distance)
- **Distance Risk**: Medium (approaching from behind)
- **Time Risk**: High (TTC ~2.5s based on relative velocity)
- **Overall Risk Score**: 2 (High Risk)

#### Obstacle 3336:
- **Position**: (333.8503, 283.6429), velocity 12.6564 m/s (fastest)
- **Trajectory**: Moving away from ego (safe distance)
- **Overall Risk Score**: 4 (Low Risk)

#### Obstacle 3349:
- **Position**: (347.9919, 304.5935), velocity 11.9656 m/s
- **Trajectory**: Similar path to ego but offset laterally
- **Overall Risk Score**: 3 (Medium Risk)

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. No obstacles are in direct collision course with ego at current timestep
2. Closest obstacle (3327) is approaching from behind but has sufficient distance
3. Ego is decelerating which helps mitigate collision risk
4. All obstacles have risk scores ≥2 (no immediate collisions)
