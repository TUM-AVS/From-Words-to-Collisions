### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep (6.0 seconds): Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 3325.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is in a different lanelet and moderately far from the ego vehicle. Trajectory suggests it's moving away laterally.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: The obstacle's velocity is higher than the ego vehicle's but the relative velocity is not high enough to cause immediate concern.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- Obstacle ID: 3327.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is in a different lanelet and moderately far from the ego vehicle. The trajectory over time indicates some lateral separation.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: The obstacle's velocity is higher than the ego vehicle's but the relative velocity is not a concern given the distance.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- Obstacle ID: 3336.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is in a different lanelet and far from the ego vehicle.  Trajectory analysis shows consistent separation.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: While the obstacle has a significantly higher velocity, the large distance mitigates the risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 3337.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is in a different lanelet and far, posing no immediate threat. Trajectory data confirms this.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Obstacle is stationary.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 3349.0
- Distance Risk reason: This obstacle is in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle and relatively close. The distance has been decreasing over the analyzed timesteps. This poses the highest risk in this scenario.
- Distance safety score: 2
- Time Risk reason: The obstacle's velocity is higher than the ego vehicle's, further increasing the risk.  The trend of decreasing distance and higher obstacle velocity contributes to a higher time risk.
- Time safety score: 2
- Overall Risk score: 2

- Obstacle ID: 3359.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is in a different lanelet and far from the ego vehicle. Trajectory data indicates no immediate concern.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Obstacle is moving very slowly and poses no time-related risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5


### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. At the last timestep (6.0s), obstacle 3349.0 is in the same lanelet (797.0) as the ego vehicle and is closing in.
2. The continuous decrease in distance between the ego vehicle and obstacle 3349.0 over the past timesteps coupled with the obstacle's higher velocity indicates a high probability of a risky situation developing.  
3. Although not an immediate collision, the trends suggest a high level of risk.
4. No other obstacles show an immediate collision risk.
