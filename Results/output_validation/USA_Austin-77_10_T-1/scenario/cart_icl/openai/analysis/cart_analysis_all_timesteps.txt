### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep:

#### Obstacle 3325.0 Analysis:
- **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is located in a different lanelet compared to the ego vehicle and has been maintaining a relatively constant distance over time. The orientation and velocity indicate that it is moving parallelly but in a separate lane. Therefore, there is minimal risk associated with its current position relative to the ego vehicle.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: The relative constant speed and movement in a separate trajectory suggest no immediate risk to the ego vehicle. The acceleration trend shows safe behavior without abrupt changes toward the ego.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

#### Obstacle 3327.0 Analysis:
- **Distance Risk reason**: Positioned in a different lanelet and maintaining a parallel path, the obstacle shows no signs of lateral movement towards the ego vehicle's path over time. The trajectory and increasing distance assure a low collision risk.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: Stable increase in velocity does not intersect with the ego vehicle's trajectory, indicating a minimal time-to-collision threat. The acceleration history supports stable lane behavior.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

#### Obstacle 3336.0 Analysis:
- **Distance Risk reason**: This obstacle is on a different trajectory, diverging from the ego vehicle's path. Rapid movement through time and distance suggests a negligible collision risk.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: The fast-moving nature and distinct path of the obstacle ensure no immediate time-based collision risk. The steady acceleration history reaffirms it moving away.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

#### Obstacle 3337.0 Analysis:
- **Distance Risk reason**: Stationary position with zero velocity and acceleration throughout history indicates no collision risk. It's static and on an entirely separate lanelet.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: Since this obstacle is not moving (velocity and acceleration remain zero), it represents no time-based collision risk.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

#### Obstacle 3349.0 Analysis:
- **Distance Risk reason**: The position and trajectory show increasingly parallel movement with the ego vehicle but in a distinct lanelet. Not posing a collision risk due to consistent separation over previous timesteps.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: The constant and controlled acceleration shows it steadily moving alongside the ego vehicle, not implying intersection with its path.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

#### Obstacle 3359.0 Analysis:
- **Distance Risk reason**: The proximity and lack of motion beyond minimal positional shifts indicate this obstacle is unlikely to intersect with the ego vehicle's path.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: The negligible velocity and no observable acceleration denote no time-based collision threat.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
Throughout the time series analysis, all obstacles maintain distinct and separate paths from the ego vehicle. No substantial changes in position, velocity, or acceleration indicate any approaching danger or collision trajectory. The scenario remains risk-free based on current paths and behavioral trends.
