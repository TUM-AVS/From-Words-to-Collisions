Obstacle 3349 is at a longitudinal distance of 0.00 meters and lateral distance of 0.00 meters relative to the ego vehicle, indicating a collision. The relative longitudinal velocity is 6.50 m/s, suggesting a high-speed impact.  The relative longitudinal acceleration is -0.97 m/sÂ², showing that the approaching rate is decreasing. The TTC is inevitably zero.

Obstacle 3327 is located at a longitudinal distance of -7.44 meters and lateral distance of -1.86 meters. It has relative longitudinal and lateral velocities of 4.46 m/s and -0.01 m/s, respectively. The longitudinal motion suggests the obstacle is approaching the ego vehicle from behind. The lateral motion suggests it is slightly moving away from the ego vehicle to the right. Even though there is currently no immediate danger, the proximity and approach rate of this obstacle present a potential risk.
