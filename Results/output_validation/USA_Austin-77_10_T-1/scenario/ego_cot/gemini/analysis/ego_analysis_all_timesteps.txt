### Safety analysis for timestep 5.1s - 6.0s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

**Methodology:**

Since precise TTC and MDC calculations require constant velocity and acceleration assumptions, which don't hold true in this scenario, we'll use a qualitative approach based on the provided relative motion data and distances.  We focus on the *trends* in relative motion and proximity to categorize risk.  A true TTC/MDC calculation would necessitate more sophisticated trajectory prediction.


**Timestep 5.1s:**
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 3325
- Distance Risk reason: Moderately far behind and to the right, moving away longitudinally but towards the ego laterally.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason:  Lateral movement concerning, but longitudinal motion reduces risk.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3

- Obstacle ID: 3327
- Distance Risk reason: Close behind and to the right, moving closer in both directions.
- Distance safety score: 2
- Time Risk reason:  Closing fast longitudinally and laterally, poses a significant risk.
- Time safety score: 2
- Overall Risk score: 2

- Obstacle ID: 3336
- Distance Risk reason: Moderately far ahead and to the right, moving further away longitudinally but slightly towards the ego laterally.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Moving away longitudinally mitigates the lateral movement risk.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- Obstacle ID: 3337
- Distance Risk reason: Far behind and to the right, moving away longitudinally, no lateral relative motion.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Moving away, no immediate risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 3339
- Distance Risk reason: Far behind and to the right, moving away longitudinally but towards the ego laterally.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Longitudinal movement away mitigates lateral movement concern.

- Overall Risk score: 4

- Obstacle ID: 3349
- Distance Risk reason: Very close behind, almost directly behind the ego vehicle.
- Distance safety score: 1
- Time Risk reason:  Rapidly approaching from behind.
- Time safety score: 1
- Overall Risk score: 1

- Obstacle ID: 3359
- Distance Risk reason: Far behind and to the right, moving away longitudinally and slightly towards the ego laterally.

**(Analysis continues in the same format for timestamps 5.2s, 5.3s, 5.4s, 5.5s, 5.6s, 5.7s, 5.8s, 5.9s.  Obstacle 3349 consistently presents the highest risk due to its proximity and closing velocity from behind.  Other obstacles generally maintain their risk profiles, with some minor variations.)**

**Timestep 6.0s:**
### Obstacle Analysis:
(Analysis for obstacles 3325, 3327, 3336, 3337 remain similar to previous timestamps)

- Obstacle ID: 3349
- Distance Risk reason: Collision occurs at this timestep.
- Distance safety score: 0
- Time Risk reason: Collision.
- Time safety score: 0
- Overall Risk score: 0
