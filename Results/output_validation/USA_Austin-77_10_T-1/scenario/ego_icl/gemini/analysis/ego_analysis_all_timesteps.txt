* **Obstacle 3325**: This obstacle is behind and to the right of the ego vehicle.  Across the timesteps, it has been generally moving further away laterally but getting closer longitudinally. At the last timestep, it is 11.83m behind and 5.35m to the right. The positive longitudinal relative velocity (2.90 m/s) indicates it is approaching from behind, while the negative lateral velocity (-0.01m/s) suggests slight lateral separation. Given the distances and velocities, the TTC is approximately 4.08s longitudinally, and lateral TTC is not meaningful. The MDC is dominated by the lateral distance and is >5m. This suggests a Low Risk (4) situation overall.

* **Obstacle 3327**: This obstacle is also behind and to the right.  It is getting closer in both dimensions throughout the provided timesteps. At the last timestep, it is 7.44m behind and 1.86m to the right, with positive longitudinal (4.46 m/s) and slightly negative lateral velocity (-0.01 m/s). TTC longitudinally is approximately 1.67s and lateral TTC is again not meaningful. The MDC is primarily determined by the lateral distance (1.86m). This is a Medium Risk (3) due to proximity and closing longitudinal distance.

* **Obstacle 3336**: This obstacle is in front and to the right and is consistently moving further away in both dimensions.  At the last timestep, it is 15.57m ahead and 5.44m to the right. Both longitudinal (7.19 m/s) and lateral (-0.03 m/s) relative velocities indicate separation. This is a No Risk (5) situation.

* **Obstacle 3337**: This obstacle is far behind and to the right, increasing its distance from the ego vehicle in both dimensions.  The negative relative velocities confirm this. It presents No Risk (5).

* **Obstacle 3349**: This obstacle is directly behind the ego vehicle, displaying exact lateral alignment throughout the timesteps. It started 4.05m behind and has been rapidly approaching with increasing relative velocity. Critically, at the final timestep, the longitudinal distance is 0.00m indicating a collision. The relative longitudinal velocity of 6.50 m/s at impact is substantial. This is a Collision Risk (0).

* **Obstacle 3359**: This obstacle is far behind and to the right, consistently moving further away, and thus categorized as No Risk (5).

**Collision Scenario Determination**:
Yes, this is a collision scenario. Obstacle 3349 has collided with the ego vehicle at the final timestep.
