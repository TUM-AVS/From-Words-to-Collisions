Here's a detailed analysis focused on the most recent timestep (6.0 seconds), considering the given obstacles:

1. **Obstacle 3325:**
   - **Position & Trajectory:** Rear-right at adjusted distances not provided (estimate used: longitudinal -11.83m, lateral -5.35m). Approaching in both dimensions.
   - **Relative Velocities:** Longitudinal 2.90 m/s, Lateral -0.01 m/s.
   - **Risk Assessment:**
     - **TTC Longitudinal:** |11.83 / 2.90| ≈ 4.08 sec – Low Risk.
     - **TTC Lateral:** Not applicable as the motion is moving away laterally.
     - **MDC:** Given the longitudinal focus, estimated MDC > 5m – No Risk.
   - **Overall Risk Score:** 5 (No Risk).

2. **Obstacle 3327:**
   - **Position & Trajectory:** Rear-right at adjusted distances not provided (estimate used: longitudinal -7.44m, lateral -1.86m). Approaching longitudinally and laterally moving away.
   - **Relative Velocities:** Longitudinal 4.46 m/s, Lateral -0.01 m/s.
   - **Risk Assessment:**
     - **TTC Longitudinal:** |7.44 / 4.46| ≈ 1.67 sec – Medium Risk.
     - **TTC Lateral:** |1.86 / 0.01| Not applicable for collision.
     - **MDC:** Longitudinally focused, estimated MDC > 3m – Medium Risk.
   - **Overall Risk Score:** 3 (Medium Risk).

3. **Obstacle 3336:**
   - **Position & Trajectory:** Front-right, moving away in both dimensions (longitudinal 15.57m, lateral -5.44m).
   - **Relative Velocities:** Longitudinal 7.19 m/s, Lateral -0.03 m/s.
   - **Risk Assessment:**
     - **TTC Longitudinal:** Not applicable as the obstacle is moving away.
     - **MDC:** Continually increasing, estimated > 5m – No Risk.
   - **Overall Risk Score:** 5 (No Risk).

4. **Obstacle 3337:**
   - **Position & Trajectory:** Rear-right, moving away (longitudinal -19.55m, lateral -12.71m).
   - **Relative Velocities:** Longitudinal -5.47 m/s, Lateral 0.00 m/s.
   - **Risk Assessment:** No risk as both positions are moving away.
   - **Overall Risk Score:** 5 (No Risk).

5. **Obstacle 3349:**
   - **Position & Trajectory:** Behind, very close with exact alignment, indicating potential collision zone (0.00m both dimensions).
   - **Relative Velocity:** Longitudinal 6.50 m/s, Lateral -0.03 m/s towards ego.
   - **Risk Assessment:**
     - **TTC:** Essentially 0 as positions are aligned; continuous high relative velocity confirms current collision.
     - **MDC:** 0 meters, indicating collision.
   - **Overall Risk Score:** 0 (Collision confirmed).

6. **Obstacle 3359:**
   - **Position & Trajectory:** Rear-right, moving away (longitudinal -19.55m, lateral -12.71m).
   - **Relative Velocities:** Longitudinal -5.47 m/s, Lateral 0.00 m/s.
   - **Risk Assessment:** No risk as both positions are moving away.
   - **Overall Risk Score:** 5 (No Risk).

**Collision Scenario Analysis:**
- **Collision Detected for Obstacle 3349**: The exact alignment in both longitudinal and lateral dimensions at 0 meters with positive closing velocity confirms a collision.
- **Justification**: The exact longitudinal and lateral alignment along with a significant positive velocity of 6.50 m/s signifies ongoing collision dynamics.

**Conclusion: Collision Scenario Present**
- The above analysis identifies Obstacle 3349 as being in a collision state with the ego vehicle, satisfying the condition for a collision scenario.
