### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 3325
    - Relative Direction: Rear-right
    - Distance Risk Reason: DTClong is -11.83m and DTClat is -5.35m. Both are outside the collision range and indicate moderate lateral distance, but comfortable longitudinal distance.  The obstacle has been consistently moving away longitudinally and laterally, which represents reduced risk over time.
    - Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 5
    - Lateral Distance Safety Score: 4
    - Overall Distance Safety Score: 4.5  (5 * 0.5 + 4 * 0.5)
    - Time Risk Reason: TTClong is 4.08s indicating low risk, while TTClat is inf, meaning no lateral collision risk is foreseeable based on current trajectory. Over previous timesteps, TTClong decreased, showing an increasing longitudinal risk but still low risk currently. Lateral TTC is inf, showing consistent lateral motion away from the ego vehicle.
    - Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 4
    - Lateral Time Safety Score: 5
    - Overall Time Safety Score: 4.5 (4 * 0.5 + 5 * 0.5)
    - Overall Risk Score: 5 (4.5 * 0.5 + 4.5 * 0.5 = 4.5, rounded to 5)

- Obstacle ID: 3327
    - Relative Direction: Rear-right
    - Distance Risk Reason: DTClong is -7.44m and DTClat is -1.86m. Longitudinal distance is moderate, while lateral distance is small presenting some risk. This obstacle has been approaching longitudinally and laterally, but recently lateral risk reduced due to the obstacle moving away laterally.
    - Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 5
    - Lateral Distance Safety Score: 3
    - Overall Distance Safety Score: 4 (5 * 0.5 + 3 * 0.5)
    - Time Risk Reason: TTClong is 1.67s, representing a medium risk as TTClong decreases over time. TTClat is inf suggesting no immediate lateral risk.
    - Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 3
    - Lateral Time Safety Score: 5
    - Overall Time Safety Score: 4 (3 * 0.5 + 5 * 0.5)
    - Overall Risk Score: 4 (4 * 0.5 + 4 * 0.5 = 4)

- Obstacle ID: 3336
    - Relative Direction: Front-right
    - Distance Risk Reason: DTClong is 15.57m and DTClat is -5.44m.  Longitudinal distance represents no risk. Lateral distance is moderate, showing some risk. The obstacle is moving away longitudinally and laterally, indicating reducing risk over time.
    - Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 5
    - Lateral Distance Safety Score: 4
    - Overall Distance Safety Score: 4.5 (5 * 0.5 + 4 * 0.5)
    - Time Risk Reason: Both TTClong and TTClat are inf, indicating no risk of collision based on current trajectories.
    - Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 5
    - Lateral Time Safety Score: 5
    - Overall Time Safety Score: 5 (5 * 0.5 + 5 * 0.5)
    - Overall Risk Score: 5 (4.5 * 0.5 + 5 * 0.5 = 4.75, rounded to 5)

- Obstacle ID: 3337
    - Relative Direction: Rear-right
    - Distance Risk Reason: DTClong is -19.55m and DTClat is -12.71m. Both are large negative values, clearly indicating no collision risk. The obstacle maintains its longitudinal and lateral distance from the ego vehicle over time, which is moving away from the ego vehicle.
    - Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 5
    - Lateral Distance Safety Score: 5
    - Overall Distance Safety Score: 5 (5 * 0.5 + 5 * 0.5)
    - Time Risk Reason: Both TTClong and TTClat are inf, indicating no risk in either direction, as the obstacle is moving away.
    - Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 5
    - Lateral Time Safety Score: 5
    - Overall Time Safety Score: 5 (5 * 0.5 + 5 * 0.5)
    - Overall Risk Score: 5 (5 * 0.5 + 5 * 0.5 = 5)

- Obstacle ID: 3349
    - Relative Direction: Behind
    - Distance Risk Reason: DTClong is 0.00m indicating a collision. DTClat is 0.00m showing exact alignment, but since DTClong is 0, a collision is indicated. Previous timesteps show this obstacle approaching the ego vehicle and has now collided. 
    - Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 0
    - Lateral Distance Safety Score: 5
    - Overall Distance Safety Score: 0 (0 * 1 + 5 * 0)
    - Time Risk Reason: Both TTClong and TTClat are 0.00, confirming a collision.
    - Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 0
    - Lateral Time Safety Score: 0
    - Overall Time Safety Score: 0 (0 * 1 + 0 * 0)
    - Overall Risk Score: 0 (0 * 0.5 + 0 * 0.5 = 0)

- Obstacle ID: 3359
    - Relative Direction: Rear-right
    - Distance Risk Reason: DTClong is -20.64m and DTClat is -12.67m. This indicates no risk, as the obstacle is far behind and to the right of the ego vehicle. The obstacle remains at a safe distance over time.
    - Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 5
    - Lateral Distance Safety Score: 5
    - Overall Distance Safety Score: 5 (5 * 0.5 + 5 * 0.5)
    - Time Risk Reason: TTClong is inf and TTClat is 140.30s.  There's no longitudinal risk and very low lateral risk.
    - Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 5
    - Lateral Time Safety Score: 5
    - Overall Time Safety Score: 5 (5 * 0.5 + 5 * 0.5)
    - Overall Risk Score: 5 (5 * 0.5 + 5 * 0.5 = 5)
