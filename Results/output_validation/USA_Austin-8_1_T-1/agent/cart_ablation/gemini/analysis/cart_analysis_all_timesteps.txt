Here's the collision risk analysis:

**Obstacle 3298:** This obstacle is stationary and located in the same lane as the ego vehicle, but its y-coordinate (8.91) suggests it's positioned to the side, possibly in a different part of the lane or on the shoulder.  Given the ego vehicle's trajectory and decreasing velocity, there is no immediate risk of collision. Risk score: 4 (Low risk).

**Obstacle 3300:** This obstacle is stationary and located in a different lane (434) than the ego vehicle (431).  The difference in lane position indicates there is no collision risk. Risk score: 5 (Negligible risk).

**Obstacle 3301:** This obstacle is moving in the same lane as the ego vehicle (431), and its y-coordinate is much closer to the ego vehicle's y-coordinate, suggesting a higher potential for conflict.  While the obstacle and ego vehicle are both decelerating, further analysis along a longer timeframe might be needed to determine the long-term risk. Currently, the distance between both vehicles is relatively safe. Risk score: 3 (Medium Risk)
