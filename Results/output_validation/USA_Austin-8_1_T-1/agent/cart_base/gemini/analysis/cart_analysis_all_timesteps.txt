Obstacle 3298: This obstacle is stationary and located in the same lane as the ego vehicle. However, it maintains a lateral distance, posing no immediate collision risk. While the ego vehicle is decelerating, its trajectory doesn't suggest a convergence with obstacle 3298 within the predicted timeframe.  The consistent lateral separation indicates a low risk.

Obstacle 3300: This obstacle is stationary and located in a different lane (434) than the ego vehicle (431).  Given the lane separation and the stationary nature of the obstacle, there is no collision risk.

Obstacle 3301: This obstacle is moving in the same lane as the ego vehicle and also decelerating. While both vehicles are moving in the same direction, the ego vehicle's initial speed is considerably higher. However, the ego vehicle is decelerating significantly, meaning the speed difference is reducing over the time steps.  The data doesn't indicate an immediate collision risk, but given the closing speeds and shared lane, a high risk exists, requiring monitoring and potential action.
