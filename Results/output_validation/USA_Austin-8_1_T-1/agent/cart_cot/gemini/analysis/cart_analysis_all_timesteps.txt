Obstacle 3298 shows little risk as it is stationary and positioned laterally away from the ego vehicle's trajectory. Obstacle 3300 is also stationary and poses no immediate risk due to its lateral distance from the ego vehicle's path. Obstacle 3301, while in the same lane and moving in the same direction as the ego vehicle, is also slowing down. Though the ego vehicle is decelerating more rapidly, at the last timestep the distance between the vehicles has increased compared to the initial timestep, indicating a lowered risk.  Given the deceleration trends, a low risk assessment is appropriate for the current situation with obstacle 3301.
