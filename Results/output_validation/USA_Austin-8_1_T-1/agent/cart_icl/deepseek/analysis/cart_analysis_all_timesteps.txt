### Analysis:

1. **Obstacle 3298.0**: 
   - Position: (263.7075, 8.91) at all timesteps (stationary).
   - Ego is moving towards it but the lateral distance is significant (~6.7m at 3.9s).
   - TTC is not meaningful due to lateral separation.
   - **Risk: Negligible (5)**.

2. **Obstacle 3300.0**: 
   - Position: (266.9805, 18.8923) at all timesteps (stationary).
   - Lateral distance is very large (~16.7m at 3.9s).
   - **Risk: Negligible (5)**.

3. **Obstacle 3301.0**: 
   - Position: (273.6529, 5.7916) at 3.9s.
   - Ego position: (278.44, 4.2902) at 3.9s.
   - Relative longitudinal distance: ~4.79m (ego ahead).
   - Relative longitudinal velocity: 4.163 (ego) - 2.5158 (obstacle) = 1.6472 m/s (closing).
   - TTC: 4.79 / 1.6472 â‰ˆ 2.91s.
   - Lateral distance: ~1.5m (moderate).
   - Same lanelet (431.0), but ego is ahead and decelerating.
   - **Risk: Medium (3)**.

### Highest Risks:
- No collision (0) or extreme risk (1) obstacles detected.
- Obstacle 3301.0 is the most relevant but poses only medium risk.
