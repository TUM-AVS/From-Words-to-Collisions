At timestep 3.9 seconds, the ego vehicle continues decelerating while obstacle 3301 continues to decelerate but at a slower rate than the ego vehicle.  Obstacle 3298 remains stationary. Obstacle 3300 is stationary and laterally separated from the ego vehicle.

Obstacle 3301 is in the same lane as the ego vehicle and is getting closer. This needs further analysis to confirm a collision prediction using TTC.

Obstacle 3298 is stationary and also in the same lane as the ego vehicle, with a lateral distance of roughly 6 meters and at longitudinal distance of 15 meters.

Here's the risk assessment at t=3.9s:

* **Obstacle 3298:** Low Risk (4) - Stationary and laterally separated, but monitoring is needed due to its presence in the ego's lanelet.
* **Obstacle 3300:** Negligible Risk (5) - Stationary, laterally far, and in a different lanelet. No immediate danger to the ego vehicle.
* **Obstacle 3301:** Medium Risk (3) -  Although decelerating slower than the ego vehicle, TTC and MDC calculations would be needed for a more precise collision assessment. For now, the ego's deceleration should create enough of a gap to avoid collision, but deserves monitoring.
