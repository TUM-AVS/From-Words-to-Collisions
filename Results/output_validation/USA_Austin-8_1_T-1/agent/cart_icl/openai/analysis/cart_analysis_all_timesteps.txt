To analyze this scenario, we have data for the ego vehicle and three obstacles over a series of timesteps. The focus will be on identifying the risk levels related to each obstacle at the latest timestep, which is 3.9 seconds.

**Key Observations at 3.9 seconds:**

1. **Ego Vehicle**:
   - Position: (278.44, 4.2902)
   - Velocity: 4.163 m/s
   - The ego vehicle's velocity is decreasing, and its orientation is consistent.
   
2. **Obstacle 3298.0**:
   - Position: (263.7075, 8.91)
   - Velocity: 0.0 m/s (stationary)
   - This obstacle remains quite far from the ego's path and has no lateral movement.

3. **Obstacle 3300.0**:
   - Position: (266.9805, 18.8923)
   - Velocity: 0.0 m/s (stationary)
   - Although stationary and far in a different lanelet (434.0, whereas the ego is in 431.0), it poses no immediate risk due to its position.

4. **Obstacle 3301.0**:
   - Position: (273.6529, 5.7916)
   - Velocity: 2.5158 m/s
   - This obstacle is in the same lanelet as the ego (431.0), relatively close, and its speed suggests it is slowly moving in the same general direction as the ego, but its velocity is still decreasing.

**Risk Assessment**:
- **Obstacle 3298.0**: Given its stationary state and location, there's no immediate risk.
- **Obstacle 3300.0**: Stationary within its lane, this obstacle doesnâ€™t pose a collision threat at the current separation.
- **Obstacle 3301.0**:
  - The obstacle is closer to the ego vehicle than the others and, being in the same lanelet, presents the highest risk.
  - Relative motion suggests they are slowly closing the gap; however, the decrease in the velocity of the ego vehicle means the risk isn't immediate but needs attention.

Since no obstacle is immediately threatening collision at this instant (no TTC converging rapidly to zero, all lateral distances remain adequate), the risk scores are assigned as follows:

1. **Obstacle 3301.0** presents the highest risk among the evaluated objects but still falls under **High Risk (2)** due to the decreasing distance and the same lanelet situation combined with its trending motion.

2. **Obstacle 3298.0** and **Obstacle 3300.0** pose low to negligible risk due to their relative positions and velocities.
