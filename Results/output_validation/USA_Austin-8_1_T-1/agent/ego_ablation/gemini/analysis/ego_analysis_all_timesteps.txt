At time 3.9 seconds, Obstacle 3301 poses an extreme risk of collision with the ego vehicle. It is located directly in front of the ego vehicle at a very close proximity of 0.51 meters. Its relative longitudinal velocity indicates it is moving towards the ego vehicle, and given the short distance, a collision is imminent if the current trajectories are maintained. Obstacles 3298 and 3300 are located further away longitudinally and do not pose an immediate threat of collision, although their motion towards the ego vehicle should be monitored.
