### Safety analysis for timestep 3.9 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

**- Obstacle ID: 3298**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 3298 is in front of the ego vehicle at a longitudinal distance of 10.93 meters.  This distance represents a safe margin.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: While approaching, the closing velocity is moderate (-4.16 m/s). Considering the deceleration (-2.21 m/sÂ²), ample time is available to react.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

**- Obstacle ID: 3300**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 3300 is located front-right of the ego vehicle at a longitudinal distance of 10.80 m and a moderate lateral distance. The risk is negligible given the separation.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Although moving towards the ego vehicle, the closing velocity is moderate, and the deceleration suggests sufficient time for appropriate action.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

**- Obstacle ID: 3301**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 3301 is directly in front of the ego vehicle at a very close longitudinal distance of 0.51 meters. This proximity indicates an extremely high risk of collision.
- Distance safety score: 1
- Time Risk reason:  The closing velocity is -1.65 m/s. At this speed and distance, a collision is imminent unless immediate evasive action is taken.
- Time safety score: 1
- Overall Risk score: 1
