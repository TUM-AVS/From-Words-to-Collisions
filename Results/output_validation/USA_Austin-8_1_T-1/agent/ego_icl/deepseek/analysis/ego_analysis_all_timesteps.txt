### Obstacle-by-Obstacle Analysis

#### **Obstacle 3298 (Front)**
- **Latest Position (3.9s):**  
  - Adjusted Distance: Longitudinal = 10.93m, Lateral = 0.00m  
  - Relative Velocity: Longitudinal = -4.16 m/s (approaching), Lateral = 0.00 m/s  
  - Motion: Driving toward ego longitudinally, exact lateral alignment.  

- **Trajectory Analysis:**  
  - Longitudinal distance decreasing steadily (~1m per 0.1s).  
  - No lateral motion.  

- **TTC Calculation:**  
  - TTC (longitudinal) = 10.93m / 4.16 m/s ≈ **2.63s**  
  - TTC (lateral) = N/A (no relative motion).  

- **MDC Calculation:**  
  - Since lateral distance is 0.00m and stable, MDC is longitudinal distance = **10.93m**.  

- **Risk Assessment:**  
  - TTC (2.63s) → **Medium Risk (3)**  
  - MDC (10.93m) → **No Risk (5)**  
  - **Overall Risk:** Medium Risk (3)

#### **Obstacle 3300 (Front-Right)**
- **Latest Position (3.9s):**  
  - Adjusted Distance: Longitudinal = 10.80m, Lateral = -8.89m  
  - Relative Velocity: Longitudinal = -4.16 m/s (approaching), Lateral = 0.00 m/s  
  - Motion: Driving toward ego longitudinally, no lateral motion.  

- **Trajectory Analysis:**  
  - Longitudinal distance decreasing (~1m per 0.1s).  
  - Lateral distance stable.  

- **TTC Calculation:**  
  - TTC (longitudinal) = 10.80m / 4.16 m/s ≈ **2.60s**  
  - TTC (lateral) = N/A (no relative motion).  

- **MDC Calculation:**  
  - Lateral distance (8.89m) is large and stable → **No Risk (5)**.  

- **Risk Assessment:**  
  - TTC (2.60s) → **Medium Risk (3)**  
  - MDC (8.89m) → **No Risk (5)**  
  - **Overall Risk:** Medium Risk (3)

#### **Obstacle 3301 (Front)**
- **Latest Position (3.9s):**  
  - Adjusted Distance: Longitudinal = 0.51m, Lateral = 0.00m  
  - Relative Velocity: Longitudinal = -1.65 m/s (approaching), Lateral = -0.00 m/s  
  - Motion: Driving toward ego longitudinally, exact lateral alignment.  

- **Trajectory Analysis:**  
  - Longitudinal distance decreasing rapidly (~0.3m per 0.1s).  
  - Lateral distance stable.  

- **TTC Calculation:**  
  - TTC (longitudinal) = 0.51m / 1.65 m/s ≈ **0.31s**  
  - TTC (lateral) = N/A (no relative motion).  

- **MDC Calculation:**  
  - Lateral distance = 0.00m, longitudinal distance = 0.51m → **MDC = 0.51m**.  

- **Risk Assessment:**  
  - TTC (0.31s) → **Extreme Risk (1)**  
  - MDC (0.51m) → **Extreme Risk (1)**  
  - **Overall Risk:** Extreme Risk (1)  

- **Collision Prediction:**  
  - At current trajectory, will collide within **0.31s** (longitudinal distance will reach 0m).

### Key Findings:
1. **Obstacle 3301** is at **Extreme Risk (1)** and will collide with the ego vehicle in **~0.31s** if no action is taken.  
2. Obstacles 3298 and 3300 pose **Medium Risk (3)** due to closing longitudinal distances but are not immediately critical.  
3. No current collision (risk 0) is occurring, but **Obstacle 3301** is predicted to collide imminently.  

**Action Required:** Immediate braking or evasive maneuver to avoid collision with Obstacle 3301.
