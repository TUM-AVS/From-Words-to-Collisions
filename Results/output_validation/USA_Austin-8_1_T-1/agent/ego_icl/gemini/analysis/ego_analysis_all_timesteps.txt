At t=3.9s:

**Obstacle 3298:** Located in front of the ego vehicle, longitudinal distance 10.93m, lateral distance 0.00m.  The lateral distance being zero indicates the obstacle is in the same lane as the ego vehicle. The longitudinal distance is decreasing across timesteps, indicating a closing motion. Relative longitudinal velocity is -4.16 m/s.

* TTC (longitudinal): 10.93m / 4.16m/s = 2.62s  (Medium Risk)
* MDC: Approximately 10.93m (Low Risk)

Risk Assessment: Medium (3) - due to the TTC.

**Obstacle 3300:** Located front-right of the ego vehicle, longitudinal distance 10.80m, lateral distance -8.89m. This obstacle is to the right and slightly ahead of the ego vehicle. Both longitudinal and lateral distances are relatively large. Relative longitudinal velocity is -4.16 m/s.

* TTC (longitudinal): 10.80m / 4.16m/s = 2.59s (Medium Risk)
* MDC: Considering both longitudinal and lateral distances, the MDC would be greater than either individual distance because the obstacle is at an angle to the ego vehicle. We estimate MDC as approximately 10.80m (Low Risk)

Risk Assessment: Medium (3)

**Obstacle 3301:** Located in front of the ego vehicle, longitudinal distance 0.51m, lateral distance 0.00m. This obstacle is very close to the ego vehicle and directly ahead.  The longitudinal distance is rapidly decreasing over the timesteps. Relative longitudinal velocity is -1.65m/s.

* TTC (longitudinal): 0.51m / 1.65m/s = 0.31s (Extreme Risk)
* MDC: Approximately 0.51m (Extreme Risk)

Risk Assessment: Extreme (1)
