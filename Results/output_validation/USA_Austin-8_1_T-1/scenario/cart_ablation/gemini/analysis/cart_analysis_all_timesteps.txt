At t=4.1s, Ego (3302.0) is at (277.6476, 4.5387) with velocity 3.137 m/s and decelerating at -2.7392 m/s². Obstacle 3298.0 is stationary at (263.7075, 8.91) in the same lanelet (431.0).  Obstacle 3300.0 is also stationary at (266.9805, 18.8923) in a different lanelet (434.0), posing no immediate threat. Obstacle 3301.0 is at (273.2173, 5.9283) in the same lanelet as Ego, with velocity 2.1561 m/s and decelerating at -1.9815 m/s².

While both 3298.0 and 3301.0 share the same lanelet as Ego, 3298.0 is further behind and laterally offset.  The primary concern is Obstacle 3301.0.  Both Ego and 3301.0 are decelerating, but the closing velocity and proximity suggest a high risk of collision in the near future if the current trend continues. Given the limited data, we can't definitively determine if evasive maneuvers are feasible or successful within the next few timesteps.  Therefore, we classify Obstacle 3301.0 as presenting an *Extreme Risk* with a score of 1.

  "ScenarioAnalysis": {
    "IsCollisionScenario": false,
    "Reasoning": "Obstacle 3301.0 poses an extreme risk due to its proximity, closing velocity, and shared lanelet with Ego. While both are decelerating, the current trajectory suggests a likely collision if no evasive action is taken."
