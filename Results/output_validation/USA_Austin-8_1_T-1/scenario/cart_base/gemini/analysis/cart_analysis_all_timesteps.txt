At t=4.1s, Ego is in lane 431 and decelerating.

Obstacle 3298 is stationary in the same lane, but far behind Ego, posing no immediate risk.

Obstacle 3300 is stationary in a different lane (434) and poses no risk.

Obstacle 3301 is in the same lane as Ego (431) and also decelerating.  Critically, both Ego and Obstacle 3301 are converging on nearly the same position.  Ego's position is (277.6476, 4.5387) while Obstacle 3301 is at (273.2173, 5.9283).  Given the current velocities and decelerations, a collision in the next timestep is highly probable. This constitutes an Extreme Risk.
