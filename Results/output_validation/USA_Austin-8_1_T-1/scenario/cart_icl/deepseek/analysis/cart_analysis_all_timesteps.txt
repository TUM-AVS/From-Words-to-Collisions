### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep (4.1 seconds):

### Obstacle Analysis:
1. **Obstacle ID: 3298.0**  
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Static obstacle in the same lanelet (431.0) as ego. Distance is decreasing over time (from 19.4385m at 3.2s to 13.9403m at 4.1s).  
   - **Distance safety score**: 2 (High Risk)  
   - **Time Risk reason**: Ego is decelerating but still approaching the static obstacle. TTC ~4.44s (distance/relative velocity = 13.9403/3.137).  
   - **Time safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk)  
   - **Overall Risk score**: 2 (High Risk)  

2. **Obstacle ID: 3299.0**  
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Static obstacle in a different lanelet (725.0). Lateral distance is large (~38.8m).  
   - **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)  
   - **Time Risk reason**: No movement or threat trajectory.  
   - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)  
   - **Overall Risk score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)  

3. **Obstacle ID: 3300.0**  
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Static obstacle in a different lanelet (434.0). Lateral distance is ~15.6m.  
   - **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)  
   - **Time Risk reason**: No movement or threat trajectory.  
   - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)  
   - **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low Risk)  

4. **Obstacle ID: 3301.0**  
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Moving in the same lanelet (431.0) as ego. Distance is decreasing (from 7.3887m at 3.2s to 4.4303m at 4.1s).  
   - **Distance safety score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)  
   - **Time Risk reason**: Ego is decelerating faster than the obstacle. TTC ~4.43m / (3.137 - 2.1561) = ~4.51s.  
   - **Time safety score**: 2 (High Risk)  
   - **Overall Risk score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)  

5. **Obstacle ID: 3303.0**  
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Moving slowly in a different lanelet (725.0). Lateral distance is ~45.6m.  
   - **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)  
   - **Time Risk reason**: No significant threat trajectory.  
   - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)  
   - **Overall Risk score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)  

6. **Obstacle ID: 3304.0**  
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Static obstacle in a different lanelet (726.0). Lateral distance is ~40.9m.  
   - **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)  
   - **Time Risk reason**: No movement or threat trajectory.  
   - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)  
   - **Overall Risk score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)  

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. **Ego Behavior**: Ego is decelerating (from 8.692 m/s to 3.137 m/s) but still moving toward obstacles in lanelet 431.0.  
2. **Critical Obstacles**: Obstacle 3301.0 is the most critical (Extreme Risk) due to proximity and same-lane trajectory. Obstacle 3298.0 is High Risk but farther away.  
3. **Collision Check**: No collision has occurred yet, but Obstacle 3301.0 poses an imminent threat if deceleration is insufficient.
