### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 3298.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is far from ego and poses no immediate threat.  Lateral separation is significant. History shows no convergence.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Obstacle is stationary. No time-based risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 3300.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is in a different lane and poses no immediate threat. Lateral separation is significant. History shows no convergence.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Obstacle is stationary. No time-based risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 3301.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is in the same lane and moderately close. Although ego is decelerating faster than the obstacle, the longitudinal distance is still safe. Lateral separation minimal. History shows maintained separation.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Both ego and obstacle are decelerating.  History shows a decreasing but safe closing velocity.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4


### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
No obstacles pose an immediate collision risk. Ego and Obstacle 3301.0 are in the same lane but maintaining a safe distance while decelerating. No collision is predicted based on current trajectories.
