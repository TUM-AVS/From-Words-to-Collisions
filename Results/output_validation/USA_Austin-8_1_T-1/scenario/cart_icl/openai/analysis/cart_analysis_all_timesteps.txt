### Obstacle Analysis:

#### Obstacle ID: 3298.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: Positioned significantly behind the ego vehicle and stationary over the entire examined period.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: No movement, no velocity change, remains in the same lanelet.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 3300.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: Located in a different lanelet (434.0) throughout the entire period with no movement.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: Stationary, no change in position or potential conflict trajectory.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 3301.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: Initially ahead and slightly off the path of the ego vehicle, velocity gradually decreasing but still maintaining a right-of-way ahead of the ego vehicle.
- **Distance safety score**: 3
- **Time Risk reason**: The obstacle is decelerating but still moving away from the ego vehicle, suggesting a manageable trajectory.
- **Time safety score**: 3
- **Overall Risk score**: 3

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
- The scenario presents a low to moderate collision risk based on the obstacle ahead (3301.0) decelerating but at a greater pace than the ego vehicle's deceleration.
- Obstacle 3298.0 remains stationary and does not impose any threat.
- Obstacle 3300.0 remains irrelevant to the ego vehicle's lane and trajectory.
- No risk of immediate collision is observed as the distances and velocities suggest sufficient reaction time.
