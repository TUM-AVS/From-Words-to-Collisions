### Analysis of Obstacles for Collision Risk:

#### Obstacle 3298:
- **Recent Data (4.1 seconds):**
  - **Adjusted Longitudinal Distance:** 10.10 m
  - **Adjusted Lateral Distance:** 0.00 m
  - **Relative Velocity (Longitudinal):** -3.14 m/s
  
- **Trajectory Analysis:**
  - The obstacle is consistently approaching the ego vehicle longitudinally, with decreasing longitudinal distance over time.
  
- **TTC Calculation:**
  - **TTC (Longitudinal):** \( TTC = \frac{10.10}{3.14} \approx 3.22 \) seconds
  
- **MDC Calculation:**
  - **MDC:** Primarily determined by longitudinal distance here due to alignment, which is steadily decreasing.

- **Risk Assessment:**
  - **TTC (Longitudinal: Low Risk):** Between 3.0 and 5.0 seconds
  - **MDC:** Considering distance and trajectory, no immediate collision, as distance > 5.0 meters.
  - **Overall Risk Score for Obstacle 3298:** 4 (Low Risk)

#### Obstacle 3300:
- **Recent Data (4.1 seconds):**
  - **Adjusted Longitudinal Distance:** 9.96 m
  - **Adjusted Lateral Distance:** -8.90 m
  - **Relative Velocity (Longitudinal):** -3.14 m/s

- **Trajectory Analysis:**
  - Consistently approaching, but on the front-right diagonal, more focused on longitudinal trajectory.

- **TTC Calculation:**
  - **TTC (Longitudinal):** \( TTC = \frac{9.96}{3.14} \approx 3.17 \) seconds
  
- **MDC Calculation:**
  - **MDC:** Based on diagonal position and decreasing trajectory.

- **Risk Assessment:**
  - **TTC (Longitudinal: Low Risk):** Between 3.0 and 5.0 seconds
  - **MDC:** Safe distance with no imminent collision.
  - **Overall Risk Score for Obstacle 3300:** 4 (Low Risk)

#### Obstacle 3301:
- **Recent Data (4.1 seconds):**
  - **Adjusted Longitudinal Distance:** 0.14 m
  - **Adjusted Lateral Distance:** 0.00 m
  - **Relative Velocity (Longitudinal):** -0.98 m/s

- **Trajectory Analysis:**
  - Rapidly reducing longitudinal distance, indicating high risk of collision.

- **TTC Calculation:**
  - **TTC (Longitudinal):** \( TTC = \frac{0.14}{0.98} \approx 0.14 \) seconds

- **MDC Calculation:**
  - **MDC:** 0.14 meters (collision imminent based on continued trajectory)

- **Risk Assessment:**
  - **TTC (Collision):** Less than 0.5 seconds indicates imminent collision
  - **MDC:** 0.14 meters (indicating a collision risk)
  - **Overall Risk Score for Obstacle 3301:** 0 (Collision)

### Conclusion:
- **Collision Status:** An impending collision detected with Obstacle 3301.
- **Collision Scenario Determination:** Yes, due to detected collision risk (score 0) for Obstacle 3301.
