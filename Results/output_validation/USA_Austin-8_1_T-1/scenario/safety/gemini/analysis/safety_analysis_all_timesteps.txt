### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
                    - Obstacle ID: 3298
                    - Relative Direction: Front
                    - Distance Risk Reason: DTClong is > 5m and decreasing, but still safe. DTClat is 0, indicating perfect longitudinal alignment.  History shows consistent front and center approach.
                    - Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 5
                    - Lateral Distance Safety Score: 5
                    - Overall Distance Safety Score: 5.0
                    - Time Risk Reason: TTClong is > 5s and increasing, indicating reducing risk. TTClat is 0, maintaining longitudinal alignment. History confirms this trend.
                    - Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 5
                    - Lateral Time Safety Score: 5
                    - Overall Time Safety Score: 5.0
                    - Overall Risk Score: 5

                    - Obstacle ID: 3300
                    - Relative Direction: Front-right
                    - Distance Risk Reason: DTClong > 5m and decreasing slowly, still a safe distance. DTClat > 5m and fairly stable. History suggests obstacle remains at a safe lateral distance.
                    - Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 5
                    - Lateral Distance Safety Score: 5
                    - Overall Distance Safety Score: 5.0
                    - Time Risk Reason: TTClong is > 5s and increasing, indicating no immediate longitudinal risk. TTClat is inf, suggesting no lateral movement relative to ego. History supports these observations.
                    - Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 5
                    - Lateral Time Safety Score: 5
                    - Overall Time Safety Score: 5.0
                    - Overall Risk Score: 5

                    - Obstacle ID: 3301
                    - Relative Direction: Front
                    - Distance Risk Reason: DTClong is < 0.5m and rapidly decreasing over the past several timesteps. DTClat is 0, indicating direct longitudinal alignment. This poses an extreme risk.
                    - Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 1
                    - Lateral Distance Safety Score: 5
                    - Overall Distance Safety Score: 1.0
                    - Time Risk Reason: TTClong is < 0.5s and decreasing further, indicating impending collision. TTClat is 0, confirming the ongoing head-on approach. History shows a consistent and rapid decrease in TTC.
                    - Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 1
                    - Lateral Time Safety Score: 5
                    - Overall Time Safety Score: 1.0
                    - Overall Risk Score: 1
