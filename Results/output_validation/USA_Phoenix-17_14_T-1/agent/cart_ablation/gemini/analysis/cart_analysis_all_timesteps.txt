Here's the collision risk analysis:

**Analysis:**

The Ego vehicle (ID 3662) appears to be slowing down significantly within its lane (949).  Obstacle 3658 is stationary in the same lane as the Ego vehicle, posing the most significant risk.  Let's break down the risk for each obstacle:

* **Obstacle 3655:** Located in lanelet 950, this obstacle is stationary and poses no immediate risk.  Lateral separation appears sufficient. Risk Score: 5
* **Obstacle 3656:** Stationary in lanelet 855. Laterally separated and presents no risk. Risk Score: 5
* **Obstacle 3657:** Stationary in lanelet 951.  Laterally separated and presents no risk. Risk Score: 5
* **Obstacle 3658:**  This stationary obstacle is in the same lane (949) as the Ego vehicle and represents the primary concern. Although the Ego vehicle is decelerating, the distance between them is not provided, making precise assessment difficult. However, given the Ego vehicle's decreasing velocity, it is predicted that Ego will come very close to obstacle 3658, if not contact, in near future timesteps. Risk Score: 1 (Extreme Risk, likely to become a Collision (0) shortly.)
* **Obstacle 3659:** Located in lanelet 948, this obstacle is stationary and poses no immediate risk. Lateral separation appears sufficient. Risk Score: 5
* **Obstacle 3660:** Stationary in lanelet 854. Laterally separated and presents no risk. Risk Score: 5
* **Obstacle 3661:** Stationary in lanelet 853. Laterally separated and presents no risk. Risk Score: 5
