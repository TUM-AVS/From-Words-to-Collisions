The ego vehicle is braking and decelerating while staying in lane 949.  Several static obstacles are present. Let's analyze the risk posed by each:

* **Obstacle 3655:** Located in lanelet 950, this obstacle is laterally separated from the ego vehicle and poses no risk. Risk score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
* **Obstacle 3656:** Located in lanelet 855, this obstacle is far laterally separated from the ego vehicle and poses no risk. Risk score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
* **Obstacle 3657:** Located in lanelet 951, this obstacle is laterally separated from the ego vehicle and poses no risk. Risk score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
* **Obstacle 3658:** Located in the same lanelet (949) as the ego vehicle.  Examining the positions over time, this obstacle is very close to the ego vehicle. Although the ego vehicle is decelerating, the close proximity and static nature of the obstacle present a high risk of collision. Risk score: 2 (High Risk)
* **Obstacle 3659:** Located in lanelet 948, this obstacle is laterally separated from the ego vehicle and poses no risk. Risk score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
* **Obstacle 3660:** Located in lanelet 854, this obstacle is far laterally separated from the ego vehicle and poses no risk. Risk score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
* **Obstacle 3661:** Located in lanelet 853, this obstacle is far laterally separated from the ego vehicle and poses no risk. Risk score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
