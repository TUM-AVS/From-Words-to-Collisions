The ego vehicle is slowing down significantly as evidenced by the decreasing velocity and negative acceleration values across the timesteps.  Obstacle 3658 is stationary and located in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle, posing the highest risk. Although a collision isn't imminent in the provided data, the ego vehicle's trajectory suggests a potential collision with Obstacle 3658 if the deceleration continues at a similar rate. Obstacle 3655, although in a different lanelet and also stationary, is closer laterally to the ego vehicle than obstacle 3658 and deserves attention and a medium risk assessment. The remaining obstacles are stationary and located in different lanelets, posing negligible risk at this point.
