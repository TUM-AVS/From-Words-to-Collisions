### Analysis:

1. **Obstacle 3658 (ID: 3658)**:
   - **Position**: (435.9093, 7.0288) in lanelet 949.0 (same lanelet as ego).
   - **Relative Position**: Ego is at (435.7594, 11.84), so obstacle is slightly ahead (~4.8m longitudinally) and ~4.8m laterally.
   - **Velocity**: Obstacle is stationary (0.0 m/s), ego is decelerating (0.3338 m/s).
   - **TTC**: Not immediately calculable due to lateral separation and deceleration.
   - **Risk**: **Low Risk (4)** - Lateral distance is significant, and ego is decelerating.

2. **Obstacle 3659 (ID: 3659)**:
   - **Position**: (439.4104, 7.0489) in lanelet 948.0 (adjacent lanelet).
   - **Relative Position**: Ego is at (435.7594, 11.84), so obstacle is ahead (~3.65m longitudinally) and ~4.8m laterally.
   - **Velocity**: Obstacle is stationary (0.0 m/s), ego is decelerating (0.3338 m/s).
   - **TTC**: Not immediately calculable due to lateral separation.
   - **Risk**: **Low Risk (4)** - Lateral distance is significant, and ego is decelerating.

3. **Obstacle 3655 (ID: 3655)**:
   - **Position**: (432.4082, 6.9988) in lanelet 950.0 (adjacent lanelet).
   - **Relative Position**: Ego is at (435.7594, 11.84), so obstacle is behind (~3.35m longitudinally) and ~4.8m laterally.
   - **Velocity**: Obstacle is stationary (0.0 m/s), ego is decelerating (0.3338 m/s).
   - **TTC**: Not immediately calculable due to lateral separation.
   - **Risk**: **Low Risk (4)** - Lateral distance is significant, and ego is moving away.

4. **Obstacle 3657 (ID: 3657)**:
   - **Position**: (428.9334, 6.2286) in lanelet 951.0 (adjacent lanelet).
   - **Relative Position**: Ego is at (435.7594, 11.84), so obstacle is behind (~6.83m longitudinally) and ~5.6m laterally.
   - **Velocity**: Obstacle is stationary (0.0 m/s), ego is decelerating (0.3338 m/s).
   - **TTC**: Not immediately calculable due to lateral separation.
   - **Risk**: **Low Risk (4)** - Lateral distance is significant, and ego is moving away.

5. **Obstacles 3656, 3660, 3661 (IDs: 3656, 3660, 3661)**:
   - **Positions**: Far from ego (lateral distance > 10m).
   - **Risk**: **Negligible Risk (5)** - No meaningful risk due to large separation.
