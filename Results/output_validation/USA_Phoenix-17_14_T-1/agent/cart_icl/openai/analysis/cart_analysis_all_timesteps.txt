Here's the analysis based on the given scenario at the most recent timestep (6.4 seconds):

### Analysis of Obstacle Risks

1. **Ego Vehicle (ID: 3662.0)**
   - Positioned at (435.7594, 11.84), with a steadily decreasing velocity, reaching 0.3338 m/s. It is decelerating, indicating cautious behavior or preparation to stop.
   - Current lanelet: 949.0.

2. **Obstacle 3658.0**
   - Positioned at (435.9093, 7.0288) in lanelet 949.0.
   - This obstacle is stationary and in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle, indicating a potential risk of collision if the ego vehicle does not account for its presence.
   - **Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC)**: Approximately 5 meters longitudinally, with no relative velocity (as obstacle is stationary).
   - **Risk Level**: High Risk (2). Urgent action may be required if the ego vehicle does not change lanes or come to a stop.

3. **Other Obstacles**
   - Obstacles 3655.0, 3656.0, 3657.0 are in different lanelets or sufficiently distanced laterally, hence are not considered immediate risks.
   - Obstacles 3659.0, 3660.0, 3661.0 are further away with no relative motion suggesting impending collision, representing low to negligible risk.

Given this analysis, **Obstacle 3658.0** presents the highest risk due to its position directly on the path of the ego vehicle. Although not at a collision distance yet, it is crucial to consider its stationary nature in the same lane as a high-risk scenario needing attention.

### JSON Output
```json
{
    "CollisionObstacles": [],
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {},
    "HighRiskObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "3658.0",
        "OverallRiskScore": 2
    }
}
```
This JSON output indicates that Obstacle 3658.0 is identified as the highest-risk obstacle that requires urgent assessment, despite being considered high risk rather than extreme or collision levels based on the current trajectory and velocity of the ego vehicle.
