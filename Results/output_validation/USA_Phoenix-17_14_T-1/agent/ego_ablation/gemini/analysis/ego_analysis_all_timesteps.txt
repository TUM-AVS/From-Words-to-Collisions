At timestamp 6.4 seconds, multiple obstacles pose a significant risk to the ego vehicle.  Let's analyze each obstacle individually:

* **Obstacle 3655:**  This obstacle is at a longitudinal distance of 0.23m and a lateral distance of -1.88m (front-right).  With a closing velocity of -0.33 m/s, the MDC is extremely low, falling into the Extreme Risk category (1). The TTC is approximately 0.7 seconds. This implies risk level 2 due to the high closing velocity.

* **Obstacle 3656:** Located 9.09m longitudinally and 10.25m laterally (front-left), this obstacle presents a Negligible Risk (5) due to the large distance and slow closing velocity of -0.33 m/s.

* **Obstacle 3657:**  At 0.90m longitudinal and -5.38m lateral distance (front-right), this obstacle poses a High Risk (2). The MDC suggests a risk score between High (2) and Medium (3) but the ongoing longitudinal closing velocity (-0.38m/s) makes an eventual collision very probable, so risk level 2 is chosen.

* **Obstacle 3658:** This obstacle is directly in front of the ego vehicle at a longitudinal distance of 0.31m.  The closing velocity of -0.33 m/s results in an extremely low MDC and a TTC of under 1 second making this an Extreme Risk (1).

* **Obstacle 3659:**  Located 0.39m longitudinally and 1.90m laterally (front-left), this obstacle represents an Extreme Risk (1) with a very low MDC, indicating a likely collision.

* **Obstacle 3660:**  This obstacle is far from the ego vehicle (12.59m longitudinal and 10.21m lateral) and possesses a slow closing velocity (-0.33 m/s), resulting in a Negligible Risk (5).

* **Obstacle 3661:** Similar to 3660, this obstacle is at a safe distance (16.09m longitudinally and 10.18m laterally) and has a slow closing velocity (-0.33 m/s) which translates to a Negligible Risk (5).

Obstacles 3658, 3659, and 3655 represent the most immediate dangers. Obstacle 3658 poses the highest risk due to its position directly in front of the ego vehicle and the very short distance.
