At timestamp 6.4 seconds, obstacle 3658 is at a longitudinal distance of 0.31m and approaching the ego vehicle at -0.33 m/s.  This close proximity and closing velocity indicate a high risk of collision. Obstacles 3655 and 3659 are also relatively close, at 0.23m and 0.39m respectively, and approaching, but their longitudinal distances are slightly larger than that of Obstacle 3658. All other obstacles are further away and pose less immediate risk. Given the very small longitudinal distance to obstacle 3658, it represents a high risk.

Risk Levels:
0: Collision - Physical contact occurred or unavoidable
1: Extreme Risk - Immediate collision likely
2: High Risk - Close to collision, needs quick action
3: Medium Risk - Manageable with proper reaction
4: Low Risk - Minimal risk, sufficient time to react
5: Negligible Risk - No significant risk
