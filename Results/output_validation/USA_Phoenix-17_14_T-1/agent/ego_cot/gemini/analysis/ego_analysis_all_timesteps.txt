### Safety analysis for timestep 6.4s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

**Assumptions and Calculations:**

Since the provided scenario only includes real distances and not the dimensions of the vehicles, we'll assume a simplified vehicle size of 1m x 1m for both ego and obstacles to estimate adjusted longitudinal and lateral distances (adjusted_d_long, adjusted_d_lat). This means subtracting 0.5m from the given longitudinal and lateral real distances. Additionally, we are approximating Time to Collision (TTC) using distance/velocity. It's crucial to remember that these are approximations, and a real system would use more sophisticated methods.

### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 3655**
    - Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is in the Front-right, extremely close longitudinally (0.23m - 0.5m = -0.27m adjusted) and laterally (0.23m -0.5 = -0.27 adjusted).
    - Distance safety score: 0 (Collision)
    - Time Risk reason: Approaching with a negative relative longitudinal velocity (-0.33 m/s) indicating a closing motion. Using approximated TTC = -0.27m/-0.33m/s implies a TTC close to zero. 
    - Time safety score: 0 (Collision)
    - Overall Risk score: 0

- **Obstacle ID: 3656**
    - Distance Risk reason: Located Front-left, far longitudinally (9.09m - 0.5m = 8.59 adjusted) and laterally (9.09m - 0.5m = 8.59 adjusted).
    - Distance safety score: 5
    - Time Risk reason:  Negative relative longitudinal velocity (-0.33 m/s), but the substantial distance makes the TTC high. TTC approximation 8.59/-0.33 ~ -26 seconds.
    - Time safety score: 5
    - Overall Risk score: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 3657**
    - Distance Risk reason: Obstacle in the Front-right, close longitudinally (0.90m -0.5m = 0.4 adjusted) and laterally (0.90m - 0.5m = 0.4 adjusted).
    - Distance safety score: 1
    - Time Risk reason: Negative relative longitudinal velocity (-0.33 m/s).  TTC approximation 0.4/-0.33 ~ -1.21 seconds.
    - Time safety score: 1
    - Overall Risk score: 1

- **Obstacle ID: 3658**
    - Distance Risk reason: Obstacle in the Front, very close longitudinally (0.31m - 0.5m = -0.19 adjusted) and laterally (0.31m - 0.5m = -0.19 adjusted).
    - Distance safety score: 0 (Collision)
    - Time Risk reason: Negative relative longitudinal velocity (-0.33 m/s). TTC approximation = -0.19/-0.33m/s ~ 0.57 seconds.
    - Time safety score: 1
    - Overall Risk score: 0

- **Obstacle ID: 3659**
    - Distance Risk reason: Obstacle in the Front-left, very close longitudinally (0.39m - 0.5m = -0.11 adjusted) and laterally (0.39m - 0.5m = -0.11 adjusted).
    - Distance safety score: 0
    - Time Risk reason: Negative relative longitudinal velocity (-0.33 m/s). TTC approximation = -0.11 / -0.33 ~ 0.33 seconds
    - Time safety score: 1
    - Overall Risk score: 0

- **Obstacle ID: 3660**
    - Distance Risk reason: Located Front-left, far longitudinally (12.59m - 0.5m = 12.09 adjusted) and laterally (12.59m - 0.5m = 12.09 adjusted).
    - Distance safety score: 5
    - Time Risk reason: Negative relative longitudinal velocity (-0.33 m/s), but substantial distance. TTC approximation 12.09/-0.33 ~ -36.63 seconds.
    - Time safety score: 5
    - Overall Risk score: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 3661**
    - Distance Risk reason: Located Front-left, far longitudinally (16.09m - 0.5m = 15.59 adjusted) and laterally (16.09m - 0.5m = 15.59 adjusted).
    - Distance safety score: 5
    - Time Risk reason: Negative relative longitudinal velocity (-0.33 m/s), but substantial distance. TTC approximation 15.59/-0.33 ~ -47.24 seconds.
    - Time safety score: 5
    - Overall Risk score: 5
