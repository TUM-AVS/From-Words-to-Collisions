* **Obstacle 3655:** Front-right, longitudinal 0.23m, lateral -1.88m. Relative longitudinal velocity -0.33 m/s.  The obstacle is approaching the ego vehicle longitudinally but moving away laterally. The longitudinal TTC is 0.23m / 0.33m/s = 0.70s. MDC is approximately 0.23m since the lateral distance is increasing. This implies a High Risk (2) due to the low MDC and TTC.

* **Obstacle 3656:** Front-left, longitudinal 9.09m, lateral 10.25m. Relative longitudinal velocity -0.33 m/s. The obstacle is far from the ego vehicle and poses no immediate threat. TTC is 9.09 / 0.33 = 27.55s.  MDC is > 5.0m. Risk is Negligible (5).

* **Obstacle 3657:** Front-right, longitudinal 0.90m, lateral -5.38m. Relative longitudinal velocity -0.33 m/s. This obstacle is approaching longitudinally but diverging laterally. TTC is 0.90m / 0.33m/s = 2.73s. MDC is approximately 0.90m. This represents a Medium Risk (3).

* **Obstacle 3658:** Front, longitudinal 0.31m, lateral 0.00m. Relative longitudinal velocity -0.33 m/s. This obstacle is directly ahead and very close.  TTC is 0.31m / 0.33 m/s = 0.94s. MDC is 0.31m. This is a High Risk (2) situation due to proximity and closing longitudinal distance.

* **Obstacle 3659:** Front-left, longitudinal 0.39m, lateral 1.90m. Relative longitudinal velocity -0.33 m/s. The obstacle is close longitudinally and approaching.  TTC = 0.39m / 0.33m/s = 1.18s. MDC is approximately 0.39m. This corresponds to a High Risk (2).

* **Obstacle 3660:** Front-left, longitudinal 12.59m, lateral 10.21m. Relative longitudinal velocity -0.33 m/s. This obstacle is far and poses no immediate threat.  TTC is 12.59m / 0.33m/s = 38.15s. MDC > 5.0m. Risk is Negligible (5).

* **Obstacle 3661:** Front-left, longitudinal 16.09m, lateral 10.18m. Relative longitudinal velocity -0.33 m/s.  This obstacle is far and poses no immediate threat. TTC is 16.09m / 0.33m/s = 48.76s. MDC > 5.0m. Risk is Negligible (5).
