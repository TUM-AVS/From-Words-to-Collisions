### Detailed Analysis

#### Obstacle 3655 (Front-Right)
- **Position and Motion**: The obstacle is on the front-right. At the most recent timestep, the adjusted longitudinal distance is 0.23 meters, and lateral distance is -1.88 meters. It is moving towards the ego vehicle with a relative longitudinal velocity of -0.33 m/s.
- **Trajectory Analysis**: The longitudinal distance has decreased steadily from 0.87m to 0.23m across the timesteps, reflecting a consistent approach towards the ego vehicle.
- **TTC Calculation**: \( \text{TTC} = \frac{0.23}{0.33} \approx 0.7 \text{ seconds} \)
- **MDC Calculation**: As the longitudinal distance is close, MDC is 0.23m (limited by longitudinal trajectory since the lateral is stable and away).
- **Risk Assessment**: High Risk (2) because the MDC is below 1.0 meters and TTC is approximately 0.7 seconds.

#### Obstacle 3656 (Front-Left)
- **Position and Motion**: Positioned on the front-left with adjusted distances: longitudinal at 9.09 meters and lateral at 10.25 meters. Velocity: -0.33 m/s towards ego.
- **Trajectory Analysis**: The distances, both longitudinal and lateral, are large and indicate no immediate threat.
- **TTC Calculation**: \( \text{TTC} = \frac{9.09}{0.33} \approx 27.5 \text{ seconds} \)
- **MDC Calculation**: Well above 5 meters in both dimensions.
- **Risk Assessment**: Negligible Risk (5) as both TTC and MDC are well above 5.0 meters/seconds.

#### Obstacle 3657 (Front-Right)
- **Position and Motion**: Positioned in front-right, adjusted distances: longitudinal at 0.90 meters, lateral at -5.38 meters. Moving towards the ego vehicle.
- **Trajectory Analysis**: The longitudinal distance has been incrementally reducing from 1.53m but remains beyond extreme risk thresholds.
- **TTC Calculation**: \( \text{TTC} = \frac{0.90}{0.33} \approx 2.7 \text{ seconds} \)
- **MDC Calculation**: Longitudinal distance primarily considered: 0.90 meters.
- **Risk Assessment**: Medium Risk (3) since TTC indicates manageability but it is approaching.

#### Obstacle 3658 (Front)
- **Position and Motion**: Located directly in front with alignment in lateral distance (0.00 m) and longitudinal distance down to 0.31 m.
- **Trajectory Analysis**: Both measures were consistently reducing and are now very close.
- **TTC Calculation**: \( \text{TTC} = \frac{0.31}{0.33} \approx 0.9 \text{ seconds} \)
- **MDC Calculation**: 0.31 meters, which is critically low.
- **Risk Assessment**: High Risk (2) due to low MDC and TTC slightly less than a critical threshold.

#### Obstacle 3659 (Front-Left)
- **Position and Motion**: Situated front-left with distances: longitudinal at 0.39 meters and lateral at 1.90 meters. Consistently reducing longitudinally.
- **Trajectory Analysis**: Reduced from longitudinally 1.03m to 0.39m within eight steps, illustrating a continuing approach.
- **TTC Calculation**: \( \text{TTC} = \frac{0.39}{0.33} \approx 1.18 \text{ seconds} \)
- **MDC Calculation**: Dominant longitudinal proximity gives an MDC of 0.39 meters.
- **Risk Assessment**: Extreme Risk (1) being close to the ego vehicle with a decreasing TTC below typical safe thresholds.

#### Obstacle 3660 and 3661 (Front-Left)
- **Position and Motion**: Positioned far left with significant spacing both longitudinally (12.59m and 16.09m) and laterally (>10m). Moving slowly approaching.
- **Trajectory Analysis**: Minimal changes in distances, maintaining safe separation.
- **TTC Calculation and MDC**: Both single-digit to no adverse trajectory change detected.
- **Risk Assessment**: Negligible Risk (5) for their motion remains safely distanced.

### Summary
Based on the calculations, we conclude:

- **Obstacle 3658**: High Risk (2) due to reduced proximity distances.
- **Obstacle 3659**: Extreme Risk (1) driven by closeness and dangerous alignment trend.
- **Obstacle 3655, 3656, 3657, 3660, 3661**: From manageable to negligible risk across varying separations and trajectories.
