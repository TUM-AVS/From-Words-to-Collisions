The ego vehicle (ID 3662) is slowing down significantly within lanelet 949, as seen from the decreasing velocity and negative acceleration values across the provided timesteps.  At the most recent timestep (6.6 seconds), the ego vehicle's position is (435.7614, 11.7733).

Obstacle 3658, located at (435.9093, 7.0288) in the same lanelet (949), poses the most significant risk.  Although there's a small lateral difference in their positions, the ego vehicle's y-coordinate (11.7733) is considerably larger than the obstacle's (7.0288). Given the ego vehicle's decelerating trajectory, a collision with Obstacle 3658 is highly likely if the ego vehicle continues on its current path and the obstacle remains stationary. This constitutes an *Extreme Risk* scenario.

Other obstacles are not in the same lanelet and are significantly farther away, posing no immediate threat.  Thus, only Obstacle 3658 receives a risk score of 1.

  "ScenarioAnalysis": {
    "IsCollisionScenario": false,
    "Reasoning": "Obstacle 3658 poses an extreme risk of collision as it is stationary in the same lane and directly ahead of the decelerating ego vehicle. While not an immediate collision, the current trajectories indicate a likely future collision."
