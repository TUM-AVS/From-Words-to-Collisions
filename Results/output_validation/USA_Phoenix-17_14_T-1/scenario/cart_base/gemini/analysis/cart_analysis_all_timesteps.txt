At t=6.6s, the ego vehicle (3662.0) is in lanelet 949.0 and decelerating.  Obstacle 3658.0 is stationary in the same lanelet, posing the most significant risk. The x-coordinates are very close (435.7614 vs 435.9093), suggesting a possible rear-end collision if the ego vehicle continues to decelerate in the same lane. While the y-coordinates (11.7733 vs 7.0288) suggest some lateral separation, this isn't enough to rule out a collision given the ego vehicle's trajectory and deceleration. Obstacle 3659.0 is also in a neighboring lanelet (948.0) and relatively close, but poses a lower risk than 3658.0 due to the greater lateral distance. The other obstacles are significantly further away and in different lanelets, presenting negligible risk.
