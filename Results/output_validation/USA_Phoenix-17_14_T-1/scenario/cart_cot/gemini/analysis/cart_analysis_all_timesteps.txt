### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. **Most critical obstacles:** Obstacle 3658.0 is in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle, making it initially the most critical. However, it's located significantly behind and stationary.
2. **Trajectory analysis:** Over the 10 timesteps, the ego vehicle moves slightly forward while other obstacles remain static.  The ego vehicle's velocity is decreasing (braking), but its trajectory does not intersect with any obstacle.
3. **Relative positions, velocities, and accelerations:**  All obstacles are stationary.  The ego vehicle's decreasing velocity further reduces the likelihood of a collision. The lateral positions and lanelets confirm safe separation from other obstacles.
4. **Collision determination:** No collision has occurred or is imminent.
5. **Reasoning:**  The combination of stationary obstacles, the ego vehicle's trajectory moving away from the closest obstacle in the same lanelet, lateral separation provided by different lanelets, and the ego vehicle's braking action all contribute to a safe scenario with no collision risk.


### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
  "CollisionObstacles": null,
  "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null,
  "ScenarioAnalysis": {
    "IsCollisionScenario": false,
    "Reasoning": "No collision is detected or predicted. All obstacles are stationary. The ego vehicle is moving away from the nearest obstacle in the same lanelet and is braking, further reducing any potential risk.  Lateral separation and different lanelets eliminate collision possibilities with other obstacles."
