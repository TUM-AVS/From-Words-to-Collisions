  - **Time Risk reason**: Zero velocity and movement.
  - **Time safety score**: 5
  - **Overall Risk score**: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 3660**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Positioned at a distance, in a different lanelet with no interception trajectory.
  - **Distance safety score**: 5
  - **Time Risk reason**: Consistently stationary.
  - **Time safety score**: 5
  - **Overall Risk score**: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 3661**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: In a distant, unrelated lanelet with maintained position.
  - **Distance safety score**: 5
  - **Time Risk reason**: Zero movement observed.
  - **Time safety score**: 5
  - **Overall Risk score**: 5

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:

The ego vehicle is decelerating and slowing down over time with a consistent decline in speed and acceleration. Obstacle 3658, located within the same lanelet, imposes a medium risk due to its stationary position and proximity to the ego vehicle, but the collision trajectory is not imminent at this moment. Thus, there are no obstacles at risk scores of 0 or 1, indicating no immediate collision risk. Hence, this is not deemed a collision scenario at this time.

    "CollisionObstacles": [],
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null,
    "ScenarioAnalysis": {
        "IsCollisionScenario": false,
        "Reasoning": "No immediate collision risk detected as obstacles are stationary and mostly in separate lanelets. Obstacle 3658 presents manageable risk due to proximity but not an immediate threat."
