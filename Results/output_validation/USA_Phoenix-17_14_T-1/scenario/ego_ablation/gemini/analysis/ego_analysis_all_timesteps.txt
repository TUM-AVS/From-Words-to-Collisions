Obstacle 3658 shows an extremely high risk of collision with the ego vehicle.  At the most recent timestep (6.6 seconds), its longitudinal distance to the ego vehicle is a mere 0.24 meters, and it is moving towards the ego car at -0.26 m/s. This small distance and closing velocity suggest a likely collision in the next few timesteps if no evasive action is taken. Other obstacles, like 3655 and 3659, are also close but not as immediately critical as 3658.
