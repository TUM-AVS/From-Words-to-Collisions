Obstacle 3655 is at a longitudinal distance of 0.17m and closing at -0.26 m/s. This is a very short distance with continued closing, indicating a high risk of collision. Obstacle 3658 is even closer at 0.24m longitudinally and also closing, representing an even higher risk. Obstacle 3659 is at 0.32m and closing, also posing a significant risk.

**Risk Levels and Definitions:**
<Collision (Score: 0)>: Actual collision has occurred or is unavoidable within the next timestep.
<Extreme Risk (Score: 1)>: Immediate collision or very high likelihood of impact. Urgent action is required.
<High Risk (Score: 2)>: Close to collision or highly probable collision path. Needs prompt attention and quick manoeuvring.
<Medium Risk (Score: 3)>: Moderate collision risk but manageable with timely reactions and proper strategies.
<Low Risk (Score: 4)>: Minimal collision risk. The situation is controllable with sufficient time to react.
<Negligible Risk (Score: 5)>: No significant collision risk. Obstacles are either moving away or far enough not to interfere.

  "ScenarioAnalysis": {
    "IsCollisionScenario": false,
    "Reasoning": "Obstacle 3658 presents an extreme risk due to its very close proximity (0.24m) and closing velocity. Obstacles 3655 and 3659 also represent a high risk due to their short distances and closing velocities. While a collision hasn't occurred yet, immediate action is required to avoid an imminent impact, especially with obstacle 3658."
