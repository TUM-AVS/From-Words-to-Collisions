### Safety analysis for timestep 5.7s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 3655
- Distance Risk reason: Very close proximity in front-right (0.66m longitudinal and lateral) and moving towards the ego vehicle.
- Distance safety score: 1
- Time Risk reason: Approaching quickly with a negative relative longitudinal velocity (-0.83 m/s).  TTC is approximately 0.66m / 0.83m/s = 0.8 seconds.
- Time safety score: 1
- Overall Risk score: 1

- Obstacle ID: 3656
- Distance Risk reason:  Located at a safe distance in front-left (9.52m longitudinal and lateral).
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: While approaching, the distance and relatively low speed provide ample time to react.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 3657
- Distance Risk reason: Close proximity in front-right (1.32m longitudinal and lateral) and moving towards the ego vehicle.
- Distance safety score: 2
- Time Risk reason: Approaching with a negative relative longitudinal velocity (-0.83 m/s). TTC is approximately 1.32m / 0.83m/s = 1.6 seconds.
- Time safety score: 2
- Overall Risk score: 2

- Obstacle ID: 3658
- Distance Risk reason: Extremely close in front (0.73m longitudinal and lateral) and moving towards the ego vehicle.
- Distance safety score: 1
- Time Risk reason:  Approaching quickly with a negative relative longitudinal velocity (-0.83 m/s). TTC is approximately 0.73m / 0.83m/s = 0.88 seconds.
- Time safety score: 1
- Overall Risk score: 1

- Obstacle ID: 3659
- Distance Risk reason: Very close in front-left (0.82m longitudinal and lateral) and moving towards the ego vehicle.
- Distance safety score: 1
- Time Risk reason: Approaching quickly with a negative relative longitudinal velocity (-0.83 m/s).  TTC is approximately 0.82m / 0.83m/s = 0.99 seconds.
- Time safety score: 1
- Overall Risk score: 1

- Obstacle ID: 3660
- Distance Risk reason: Located at a safe distance in front-left (13.02m longitudinal and lateral).
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason:  While approaching, the distance and relatively low speed provide ample time to react.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 3661
- Distance Risk reason: Located at a safe distance in front-left (16.53m longitudinal and lateral).
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: While approaching, the distance and relatively low speed provide ample time to react.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5


### Safety analysis for timestep 5.8s - 6.6s:
(Analysis follows the same structure as for 5.7s.  Distances decrease, and relative velocities generally decrease over time, but multiple obstacles remain in extreme risk (score 1) throughout, particularly 3655, 3658, and 3659 due to their close proximity and continued approach.  Full analysis for each timestep omitted for brevity, but would follow the pattern shown for 5.7s)



### Summary in JSON Format:

{
  "CollisionObstacle": {
    "ObstacleID": "3655",
    "OverallRiskScore": "1"
  },
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {
      "ObstacleID": ["3658", "3659"],
      "OverallRiskScore": "1"
    },
  "IsCollisionScenario": true,
  "Justification": "Obstacles 3655, 3658, and 3659 are extremely close and approaching the ego vehicle with a high likelihood of collision within the next second, despite some deceleration. While not an immediate collision (score 0), the risk is extremely high (score 1)."

Important Considerations:

* The provided data shows a high risk of collision, especially with obstacles 3655, 3658, and 3659. Immediate evasive action is needed.
*  Even though the relative longitudinal velocities are decreasing, the MDC values are extremely low, indicating a very high probability of collision if the current trend continues.
* The small positive relative longitudinal acceleration may indicate some braking, but it doesn't appear sufficient to avoid collision given the proximity of the obstacles.  
*  Lateral movement is not a significant factor in this scenario as the relative lateral velocities are zero or near zero.  The primary concern is the closing longitudinal distance.

This analysis assumes that the current trends in relative velocity and acceleration will continue.  A more comprehensive analysis might consider additional factors such as the ego vehicle's maneuvering capabilities and the obstacles' predicted trajectories.
