* **Obstacle 3655 (Front-Right):**  The longitudinal distance is decreasing across timesteps, indicating a closing trajectory. At the last timestep, the longitudinal distance is 0.17m and the lateral distance is -1.88m. With a longitudinal relative velocity of -0.26 m/s, the TTC is 0.17/0.26 = 0.65 seconds. The MDC is approximately 0.17m (using the smaller of the two distances since the longitudinal distance is very small and closing while lateral distance is larger and relatively stable). This obstacle presents an *Extreme Risk (1)* due to the low MDC and approaching TTC.

* **Obstacle 3656 (Front-Left):** This obstacle is far away and maintains a safe distance. At the last timestep, longitudinal distance is 9.01m, lateral distance is 10.26m, and longitudinal relative velocity is -0.26 m/s. TTC is 9.01 / 0.26 = 34.65s. MDC is > 5m. This is *No Risk (5)*.

* **Obstacle 3657 (Front-Right):**  The longitudinal distance is consistently decreasing. At the last timestep, it's 0.84m with a relative velocity of -0.26 m/s, leading to a TTC of 0.84 / 0.26 = 3.23 seconds. MDC is 0.84m.  This represents a *Medium Risk (3)*.

* **Obstacle 3658 (Front):**  This obstacle poses the most significant risk.  It's directly in front and closing rapidly.  The longitudinal distance at the last timestep is 0.24m with a relative velocity of -0.26 m/s.  TTC is 0.24 / 0.26 = 0.92 seconds. MDC is 0.24m. This is a *High Risk (2)* bordering on Extreme Risk due to the very short distance and closing velocity.

* **Obstacle 3659 (Front-Left):**  Longitudinal distance is decreasing. At the last timestep it is 0.32m and lateral distance is 1.90m with a longitudinal relative velocity of -0.26m/s. The TTC is 0.32 / 0.26 = 1.23 seconds. The MDC is 0.32. This represents a *Medium Risk (3)*, although trending towards High Risk.

* **Obstacle 3660 (Front-Left):** This obstacle is distant. The last timestep shows a longitudinal distance of 12.51m, a lateral distance of 10.23m, and longitudinal relative velocity -0.26m/s, yielding a TTC of 48.12s. MDC is > 5m.  This is categorized as *No Risk (5)*.

* **Obstacle 3661 (Front-Left):** Similar to 3660, this obstacle is also far and poses no immediate risk. Longitudinal distance is 16.02m and lateral distance is 10.20m with longitudinal relative velocity of -0.26m/s. TTC is 61.62s. MDC is > 5m.  This is *No Risk (5)*.


**Conclusion:**

This IS a collision scenario. Obstacle 3655 presents an Extreme Risk (1) due to its proximity (0.17m longitudinally) and closing velocity, resulting in a very low MDC (0.17m) and an approaching TTC of 0.65 seconds.
