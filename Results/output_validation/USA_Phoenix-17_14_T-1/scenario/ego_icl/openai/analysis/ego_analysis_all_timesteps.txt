In this scenario involving multiple obstacles, we will analyze each obstacle based on the most recent timestep at 6.6 seconds, using adjusted distances (which are not provided, but assumed to be considered similarly to raw data for this analysis due to instructions to use the adjusted data).

### Obstacle Analysis

**Obstacle 3655 (Front-right)**
- Adjusted Longitudinal distance: 0.17m, Lateral distance: -1.89m
- Relative Velocity: Longitudinal -0.26 m/s
- Trajectory indicates that the obstacle is closing longitudinally on the ego vehicle:
  - **TTC (Longitudinal)**: 0.17 / 0.26 = 0.65 seconds
  - **MDC (Presumed based on provided data alignment to low distances)**: ≈0.17m
  - **Risk Assessment**:
    - Extreme Risk due to short MDC and time to collision. Obstacle is almost aligned with continued closure, indicating potential collision without intervention.
    
**Obstacle 3656 (Front-left)**
- Adjusted Longitudinal distance: 9.01m, Lateral distance: 10.26m
- Relative Velocity: Longitudinal -0.26 m/s, lateral changes are negligible
- Longitudinal trajectory is slow for imminent risk:
  - **TTC (Longitudinal)**: 9.01 / 0.26 = 34.65 seconds
  - **MDC**: >5m
  - **Risk Assessment**:
    - No immediate risk, given the large distance and slow approach rate.

**Obstacle 3657 (Front-right)**
- Adjusted Longitudinal distance: 0.84m, Lateral distance: -5.38m
- Relative Velocity: Longitudinal -0.26 m/s
- **TTC (Longitudinal)**: 0.84 / 0.26 = 3.23 seconds
- **MDC**: ≈0.84m
- **Risk Assessment**:
  - Medium risk due to the trajectory, which indicates potential for collision over many seconds but not imminent.

**Obstacle 3658 (Front)**
- Adjusted Longitudinal distance: 0.24m, Lateral distance: 0.00m
- Relative Velocity: Longitudinal -0.26 m/s
- Strong alignment and small distance:
  - **TTC (Longitudinal)**: 0.24 / 0.26 = 0.92 seconds
  - **MDC**: ≈0.24m
  - **Risk Assessment**:
    - High risk due to alignment, but not collision instantaneously since lateral distance consideration holds it just above direct contact. However, very strong extreme risk indicator potentially due to converging paths.

**Obstacle 3659 (Front-left)**
- Adjusted Longitudinal distance: 0.32m, Lateral distance: 1.90m
- Relative Velocity: Longitudinal -0.26 m/s
- **TTC (Longitudinal)**: 0.32 / 0.26 = 1.23 seconds
- **MDC**: ≈0.32m
- **Risk Assessment**:
  - Extreme risk due to small longitudinal distance and closing velocity indicating urgent collision risk potential without quick intervention.

**Obstacle 3660 (Front-left)**
- Adjusted Longitudinal distance: 12.51m, Lateral distance: 10.23m
- Relative Velocity: Longitudinal -0.26 m/s
- **TTC (Longitudinal)**: 12.51 / 0.26 = 48.12 seconds
- **MDC**: >5m
- **Risk Assessment**:
  - No risk, trajectory and large distance imply safe difference over reasonable time, well beyond typical driving decision timelines.

**Obstacle 3661 (Front-left)**
- Adjusted Longitudinal distance: 16.02m, Lateral distance: 10.20m
- Relative Velocity: Longitudinal -0.26 m/s
- **TTC (Longitudinal)**: 16.02 / 0.26 = 61.62 seconds
- **MDC**: >5m
- **Risk Assessment**:
  - No risk, similar reasoning with obstacle 3660 given trajectory and distances.

### Conclusion

Among these obstacles, Obstacle 3659 presents the highest risk, flagged as an extreme risk due to its short MDC (around 0.32m) and rapidly closing distance with the ego vehicle. The spacing and motion alignment place Obstacle 3658 slightly closely indicative of potential contact, but the more critical scenario lies within 3659's most urgent collision possibility.

**Scenario Identification**: 
This scenario is identified as a collision scenario due to the extreme risk rating of Obstacle 3659, which is only a fraction away from direct contact.
