Here's the collision risk analysis:

**Ego Vehicle (ID: 3665):** The ego vehicle maintains a consistent trajectory within its lane (949) throughout the provided timeframe. Its velocity and acceleration change gradually and doesn't suggest erratic behavior.

**Obstacle 3655:** Initially located in lanelet 2771, this obstacle demonstrates consistently increasing velocity and moves closer to the ego vehicle's y-coordinate over time.  While not an immediate collision risk, the trend suggests a potential future risk if both the ego vehicle and obstacle 3655 maintain their current trajectories. The proximity and velocity trend put this in the High-Risk category.

**Obstacle 3656:** Stationary and far from the ego vehicle throughout the scenario, posing no risk.

**Obstacle 3657:** Stationary and sufficiently far from the ego vehicle's trajectory, posing no risk.

**Obstacle 3658:** Located in lanelet 2691 (and later 2690) and moves with increasing velocity.  The y-coordinate suggests it is likely not in the ego vehicle's direct path, and its x coordinates indicate it is moving away from the ego vehicle, hence a Low Risk.

**Obstacle 3659:** Similar movement pattern to Obstacle 3658; increasing velocity and a decreasing y coordinate, but not an immediate threat. Medium Risk.

**Obstacles 3660, 3661, 3663, 3664:**  These obstacles are stationary and located far from the ego vehicle's path, presenting negligible risk.

**Obstacle 3662:** In lanelet 950, this obstacle moves with moderate velocity and maintains a safe distance from the ego vehicle, posing a Low Risk.

**Obstacle 3666:** Sharing lanelet 948 with the ego vehicle, it maintains its distance, and though its speed is increasing, it is still relatively far and predictable. Low risk.

**Obstacle 3667:** This obstacle initially in lanelet 944 and later 949 is approaching the ego vehicle from behind with moderate velocity. While not a current risk, its approach warrants attention and places it in the Medium Risk category due to the relative velocity difference.

**Obstacle 3668:**  Initially in lanelet 945 and later 950, shows increasing velocity but maintains its trajectory behind and to the side of the ego vehicle, thus a Medium Risk.


**Obstacle 3669:**  Stationary and poses no risk to the ego vehicle.
