Obstacles 3656, 3657, 3660, 3661, 3663, and 3664 are stationary and pose no risk as they are far from the ego vehicle's trajectory. Obstacle 3669 is also practically stationary and far away, posing no risk.

Obstacles 3655, 3658, and 3659 are moving towards the ego vehicle and their y-coordinates are becoming more negative, suggesting they may cross the ego vehicle's path. However, their x-coordinates and the ego vehicle's projected trajectory indicate they will remain laterally separated.  These obstacles are classified as medium risk (3) due to their dynamic nature but relatively safe lateral distance.

Obstacles 3666, 3667, and 3668 are moving in the same general direction as the ego vehicle and are in relatively close proximity. Obstacle 3666 is slightly ahead of the ego vehicle and moving away, presenting a low risk (4).  Obstacles 3667 and 3668 are behind the ego vehicle.  Obstacle 3667 appears to be gaining on the ego vehicle but maintains a safe following distance throughout the provided timesteps, therefore it's categorized as medium risk (3). Obstacle 3668 also remains behind the ego vehicle at a seemingly safe distance and categorized as a low risk (4). 

Obstacle 3662 is approaching the ego vehicle. Across the timesteps, obstacle 3662 is observed to be moving closer to the ego vehicle. At 11.4 seconds, the y-coordinate is 4.5651 versus ego's 9.724. While there is no immediate collision, the closing distance and the ego vehicle's decelerating behavior signal a potential high risk. Therefore, obstacle 3662 is categorized as high risk (2).
