Obstacle 3667 and 3668 are showing concerning behavior. They are approaching the ego vehicle from behind with relatively high speed and moderate acceleration. While a collision is not imminent in the next few seconds, the current trajectories suggest a potential for high risk in the near future if these trends continue.  Obstacle 3658 and 3659 are moving away from the ego vehicle and do not pose an immediate threat. The other stationary obstacles also do not pose a risk currently.
