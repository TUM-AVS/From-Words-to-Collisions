**Analysis of Risky Obstacles:**

1. **Obstacle 3655.0** has an increasing velocity and is moving towards the ego vehicle from behind with a decreasing longitudinal distance. Over the observed time steps, its velocity increased from 5.7739 m/s to 7.3255 m/s, and its movements suggest it is closing in on the ego vehicle located in front significantly. The position and trajectory indicate potential rear-end collision risk. However, it maintains a separate lanelet from the ego vehicle, reducing the immediate risk of side collision.

2. **Obstacle 3658.0** shares a lanelet very close to the line of the ego vehicle and moves towards it with a relatively higher velocity (7.2302 m/s up from 5.6531 m/s) and is accelerating. The velocity direction and configuration make it particularly concerning due to the potential for rear-end interaction or lane-changing maneuvers by either the ego or the dynamic obstacles around it.

3. **Obstacle 3659.0** is also showing risk by moving significantly within reach of the lanelet of the ego vehicle. It has been accelerating steadily, and its velocity has increased from 4.8222 m/s up to 6.2426 m/s. The relative position and similarity in orientation signify a converging trajectory towards the ego's position and pose a notable collision risk.

}
```

**Explanation:**

- **Obstacle 3658.0** is at risk 0 due to its rapid acceleration and convergence in lane with extremely little space for evasive action.
- **Obstacle 3659.0** is ranked at risk 1 (Extreme Risk) as it is accelerating and entering the trajectory of the ego closely, with decreasing space and options to react.
- **Obstacle 3655.0** is rated a 2 (High Risk) considering how it is approaching from the rear with increasing speed amidst limited buffer, demanding significant observation and potential intervention to avoid collision progression.
