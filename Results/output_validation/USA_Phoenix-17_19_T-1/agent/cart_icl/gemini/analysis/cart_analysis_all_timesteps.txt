Obstacle 3658 shows concerning behavior. It's accelerating towards the ego vehicle and its y-coordinate suggests a potential lane change into the ego vehicle's path.  The decreasing distance between them, combined with the obstacle's acceleration, raises the risk level. However, it's not an immediate collision, but warrants close monitoring.

Obstacle 3659 is also accelerating and getting closer to the ego vehicle, and the y-coordinate suggests it will soon be very close to the ego vehicle. This poses a high risk, but not an immediate collision.

Obstacle 3667 is moving in roughly the same direction as the ego vehicle but has a higher velocity and is getting increasingly closer in y-coordinate. This means it is likely to overtake the ego vehicle soon and very closely, therefore it represents a medium risk.
