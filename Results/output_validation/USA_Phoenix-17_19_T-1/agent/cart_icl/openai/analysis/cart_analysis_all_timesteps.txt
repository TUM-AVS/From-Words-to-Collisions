To analyze the scenario at hand, I will focus on the relative distances and velocities between the ego vehicle and the obstacles at the most recent timestep recorded, which is at 11.4 seconds.

### Analysis:

1. **Ego Vehicle (3665.0) Details:**
   - Position: (435.8324, 9.724)
   - Velocity: 1.6347 m/s
   - Lanelet: 949.0

2. **Obstacle Analysis:**

   - **Obstacle 3658.0:**
     - Position: (435.2823, -7.9096)
     - Velocity: 7.2302 m/s
     - Lanelet Change: From 2690.0 to 2689.0, seems to be cutting across 
     - Relative Longitudinal and Lateral Distances: 
       - Approximate lateral distance ≈ 17.6336 m (9.724 - (-7.9096))
     - Tracking rapid lateral approach suggests this is moving across the potential path of the ego vehicle with significant speed.

   - **Obstacle 3659.0:**
     - Position: (439.0605, -5.3387)
     - Velocity: 6.2426 m/s
     - Lanelet: 2690.0
     - Relative Longitudinal and Lateral Distances: 
       - Longitudinal distance ≈ -3.2281 m (435.8324 - 439.0605), indicating it is slightly ahead laterally displaced 
       - Lateral distance ≈ 15.0627 m (9.724 - (-5.3387))
     - Although close in longitudinal axis, lateral position (5.3387m to the side in other lanes) suggests lower immediate risk until significant lane changes occur.

   - **Obstacle 3655.0:**
     - Position: (431.8242, -7.6098)
     - Velocity: 7.3255 m/s
     - Lanelet Change: From 2690.0 to 2689.0, conflicting path risk
     - Longitudinal distance ≈ 4.0082 m (435.8324 - 431.8242), implying this is behind ego 
     - Lateral distance ≈ 17.3338 m
     - The significant speed, position, and lane change might reflect potential for future high-risk consideration.

   - **Lane change dynamics and motion predict low immediate collision unless trajectory maintains path directly towards ego in an unforeseen maneuver such as swerve.

### Risk Levels:

Given the nature of motion, lane changes, and relative positioning, here's the assessment:

- **Obstacle 3658.0**: High longitudinal speeds but primarily lateral paths suggest future path overlap depending on motion not in our control. **Risk: Medium (3)**
- **Obstacle 3659.0**: With the existing lateral displacement, less immediate until significant changes in trajectory lie ahead. Risk: **Low (4)**
- **Obstacle 3655.0**: Despite speed, remains likely in a feasible relative path safely assuming no significant and abrupt action near borders lanes observed. Risk: **Medium (3)**

From the analysis, none of the obstacles indicate a zero or one-risk level demanding imminent high action based on current trajectory and path prediction.
