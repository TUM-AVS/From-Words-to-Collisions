At timestamp 11.4 seconds, the following obstacles present varying levels of risk:

* **Obstacle 3655:**  Front-right, moving away longitudinally and laterally. No risk. (Proximity: 5, MDC: 5, TTC: 5)
* **Obstacle 3656:** Front-left, approaching longitudinally, but at a safe distance and lateral position.  Low risk. (Proximity: 4, MDC: 4, TTC: 4)
* **Obstacle 3657:** To the right, longitudinally aligned (meaning a potential side collision). Although lateral distance is greater than MDC threshold for high risk and  relative longitudinal velocity is negative (moving towards each other) combined with zero lateral relative velocity implies the risk of collision is low. Low Risk (Proximity: 4, MDC: 4, TTC: 4)
* **Obstacle 3658:** Front, moving away longitudinally. No risk. (Proximity: 5, MDC: 5, TTC: 5)
* **Obstacle 3659:** Front-left, moving away longitudinally. Low risk. (Proximity: 4, MDC: 4, TTC: 4)
* **Obstacle 3660:** Front-left, distant, approaching longitudinally, but poses no immediate threat. Low risk. (Proximity: 4, MDC: 4, TTC: 4)
* **Obstacle 3661:**  Front-left, distant, approaching longitudinally, but poses no immediate threat. Negligible risk. (Proximity: 5, MDC: 5, TTC: 5)
* **Obstacle 3662:** Front-right, moving away longitudinally and laterally. Minimal risk given its current trajectory. Proximity score is 2 given its longitudinal distance to ego car. Medium risk. (Proximity: 2, MDC: 3, TTC: 3)
* **Obstacle 3663:** Front-left, distant, approaching slowly. No risk. (Proximity: 5, MDC: 5, TTC: 5)
* **Obstacle 3664:** Front-left, very distant. Negligible risk. (Proximity: 5, MDC: 5, TTC: 5)
* **Obstacle 3666:** Left, longitudinally aligned, lateral distance suggests minimal risk given the current trajectory. Low risk. (Proximity: 4, MDC: 4, TTC: 4)
* **Obstacle 3667:** Behind, approaching longitudinally. MDC is close, suggesting High risk. (Proximity: 2, MDC: 2, TTC: 2)
* **Obstacle 3668:** Rear-right, approaching from behind, lateral movement suggests increasing lateral distance. High risk. (Proximity: 2, MDC: 2, TTC: 2)
* **Obstacle 3669:** Right, longitudinally aligned but with significant lateral distance.  Low risk. (Proximity: 4, MDC: 4, TTC: 4)
