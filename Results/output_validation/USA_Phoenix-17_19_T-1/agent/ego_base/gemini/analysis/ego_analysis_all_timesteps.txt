At timestamp 11.4 seconds, let's analyze the risk posed by each obstacle:

* **Obstacle 3655:** Front-right, moving away longitudinally and laterally. Poses no immediate risk. Risk score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
* **Obstacle 3656:** Front-left, approaching longitudinally but at a safe distance.  Lateral movement is negligible. Risk score: 4 (Low Risk)
* **Obstacle 3657:** To the right and stationary relative to the ego vehicle's longitudinal motion, safe lateral distance. Risk score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
* **Obstacle 3658:** Front, moving away longitudinally. No lateral relative motion.  Risk score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
* **Obstacle 3659:** Front-left, moving away longitudinally, and approaching laterally, but with sufficient distance. Risk score: 4 (Low Risk)
* **Obstacle 3660:** Front-left, approaching longitudinally at a safe distance. No lateral relative motion. Risk score: 4 (Low Risk)
* **Obstacle 3661:** Front-left, approaching longitudinally at a safe distance. No lateral relative motion. Risk score: 4 (Low Risk)
* **Obstacle 3662:** Front-right, just ahead of the ego vehicle and moving away longitudinally. Although the lateral distance is small, it's moving away. Risk score: 3 (Medium Risk)
* **Obstacle 3663:** Front-left, approaching longitudinally at a safe distance. No lateral relative motion. Risk score: 4 (Low Risk)
* **Obstacle 3664:** Front-left, approaching longitudinally at a safe distance. No lateral relative motion. Risk score: 4 (Low Risk)
* **Obstacle 3666:** Left, poses no risk as it is longitudinally aligned and laterally safe. Risk score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
* **Obstacle 3667:** Behind, approaching longitudinally, but not extremely rapidly.  Lateral motion negligible. Risk score: 4 (Low Risk)
* **Obstacle 3668:** Rear-right, approaching longitudinally. Lateral distance is small and although it's slightly moving away laterally, it's still fairly close. Risk score: 3 (Medium Risk).
* **Obstacle 3669:** To the right, stationary relative to the ego vehicle's longitudinal motion, safe lateral distance. Risk score: 5 (Negligible Risk)

Risk Levels:
0: Collision - Physical contact occurred or unavoidable
1: Extreme Risk - Immediate collision likely
2: High Risk - Close to collision, needs quick action
3: Medium Risk - Manageable with proper reaction
4: Low Risk - Minimal risk, sufficient time to react
5: Negligible Risk - No significant risk
