### Safety analysis for timestep 11.4s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

**Assumptions and Calculations:**

* **Adjusted Distance:**  Since raw DTClong and DTClat are provided, and no vehicle size information is given, I will use these values directly.  In a real-world scenario, you would subtract ego and obstacle vehicle dimensions to get a more accurate assessment. Also, we will use vector addition to combine DTClong and DTClat, calculating total distance using Pythagorean theorem or similar method for MDC values.
* **TTC:** Calculated as `Adjusted Distance / Relative Velocity`.  If `Relative Velocity` is close to zero or negative (moving away), TTC will be considered high (no immediate risk).
* **No information given about the relation between adjusted and raw distance.**
