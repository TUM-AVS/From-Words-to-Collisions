Let me analyze the most recent timestep (11.4 seconds) for collision risks:

1. Obstacle 3655 (Front-right):
   - Moving away longitudinally (5.59 m/s) and laterally (-1.20 m/s)
   - Distance: 12.57m long, -3.36m lat
   - No collision risk (Risk 5)

2. Obstacle 3656 (Front-left):
   - Approaching longitudinally (-1.63 m/s), no lateral motion
   - Distance: 7.22m long, 9.04m lat
   - TTC: 7.22/1.63 = 4.43s (Risk 4)
   - MDC: 7.22m (Risk 4)

3. Obstacle 3657 (Right):
   - Exact longitudinal alignment, no lateral motion
   - Distance: 0m long, -5.48m lat
   - No collision risk as moving apart (Risk 5)

4. Obstacle 3658 (Front):
   - Moving away longitudinally (5.50 m/s)
   - Distance: 13.07m long, 0m lat
   - No risk (Risk 5)

5. Obstacle 3659 (Front-left):
   - Moving away longitudinally (4.53 m/s), approaching laterally (-0.98 m/s)
   - Distance: 10.71m long, 0.77m lat
   - Lateral TTC: 0.77/0.98 = 0.79s (Risk 2)
   - MDC: 0.77m (Risk 2)

6. Obstacle 3660 (Front-left):
   - Approaching longitudinally (-1.63 m/s)
   - Distance: 10.71m long, 8.91m lat
   - TTC: 10.71/1.63 = 6.57s (Risk 5)

7. Obstacle 3661 (Front-left):
   - Approaching longitudinally (-1.63 m/s)
   - Distance: 14.22m long, 8.78m lat
   - TTC: 14.22/1.63 = 8.72s (Risk 5)

8. Obstacle 3662 (Front-right):
   - Moving away longitudinally (4.32 m/s) and laterally (-0.25 m/s)
   - Distance: 0.45m long, -2.04m lat
   - MDC: 0.45m (Risk 1 - Extreme risk due to very close longitudinal distance)

9. Obstacle 3666 (Left):
   - Exact longitudinal alignment, approaching laterally (-0.13 m/s)
   - Distance: 0m long, 1.79m lat
   - TTC: 1.79/0.13 = 13.77s (Risk 5)
   - MDC: 1.79m (Risk 4)

10. Obstacle 3667 (Behind):
    - Approaching from behind (2.81 m/s)
    - Distance: -0.86m long, 0m lat
    - Already overlapping longitudinally (Risk 0 - Collision occurring)

11. Obstacle 3668 (Rear-right):
    - Approaching from behind (2.98 m/s), moving away laterally
    - Distance: -1.52m long, -1.76m lat
    - Already overlapping longitudinally (Risk 0 - Collision occurring)

JSON Summary:
```json
{
    "CollisionObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "3667",
        "OverallRiskScore": "0"
    },
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "3662",
        "OverallRiskScore": "1"
    },

        "ObstacleID": "3668",
        "OverallRiskScore": "0"
    }
}
```

Key Findings:
1. Obstacle 3667 is currently colliding with the ego vehicle from behind (negative longitudinal distance)
2. Obstacle 3668 is also colliding from the rear-right
3. Obstacle 3662 presents extreme risk (MDC = 0.45m) as it's very close to the front-right
4. Obstacle 3659 shows high risk due to lateral approach (TTC = 0.79s)

The situation requires immediate evasive action as there are both rear collisions occurring and an imminent front-right collision risk.
