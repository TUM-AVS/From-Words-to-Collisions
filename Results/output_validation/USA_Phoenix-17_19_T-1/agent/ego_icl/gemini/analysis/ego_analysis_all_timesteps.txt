* **Obstacle 3655:** Front-right, moving away longitudinally and laterally. No risk.
* **Obstacle 3656:** Front-left, approaching longitudinally, lateral distance large and stable.  TTC_long = 7.22 / 1.63 ≈ 4.43s (Low Risk). Lateral motion negligible. Overall: Low Risk (4).
* **Obstacle 3657:** To the right, longitudinally aligned, lateral distance significant and stable. No immediate risk.  Overall: Medium Risk (3).
* **Obstacle 3658:** Front, moving away longitudinally. Lateral distance 0, but no lateral velocity. No risk.
* **Obstacle 3659:** Front-left, moving away longitudinally, slight lateral approach but distance still significant.  TTC_long = 10.71 / 4.53 ≈ 2.36s (Medium Risk). Lateral motion minimal. Overall: Medium Risk (3).
* **Obstacle 3660:** Front-left, longitudinally approaching, large and stable lateral distance. TTC_long = 10.71 / 1.63 ≈ 6.57s (Negligible Risk). No lateral relative motion. Overall: Negligible Risk (5).
* **Obstacle 3661:** Front-left, longitudinally approaching, large and stable lateral distance. TTC_long = 14.22 / 1.63 ≈ 8.72s (Negligible Risk).  No lateral motion. Overall: Negligible Risk (5).
* **Obstacle 3662:** Front-right, moving away longitudinally and laterally. Initially aligned longitudinally, but now separating. No risk.
* **Obstacle 3663:** Front-left, longitudinally approaching, large and stable lateral distance. TTC_long = 17.72 / 1.63 ≈ 10.87s (Negligible Risk). No lateral motion. Overall: Negligible Risk (5).
* **Obstacle 3664:** Front-left, longitudinally approaching, large and stable lateral distance. TTC_long = 21.22 / 1.63 ≈ 13.02s (Negligible Risk). No lateral motion. Overall: Negligible Risk (5).
* **Obstacle 3666:** Left, longitudinally aligned, small lateral distance but slight lateral approach. TTC_lat = 1.79 / 0.13 ≈ 13.77s, however, this obstacle should be monitored carefully in the next few timesteps.  Overall: Medium Risk (3).
* **Obstacle 3667:** Behind, approaching longitudinally, lateral distance 0. TTC_long = 0.86 / 2.81 ≈ 0.31s (Extreme Risk). Overall: Extreme Risk (1).
* **Obstacle 3668:** Rear-right, approaching longitudinally, moving away laterally. TTC_long = 1.52 / 2.98 ≈ 0.51s (High Risk). Lateral motion minimal. Overall: High Risk (2).
* **Obstacle 3669:** Right, longitudinally aligned, lateral distance large and stable. No risk.
