At t=11.6s, Ego is at (435.8494, 9.3969) and moving with a velocity of 1.7479 and acceleration of 0.3614 in lanelet 949.0.  Let's analyze the closest obstacles:

* **Obstacle 3662:** This obstacle is in lanelet 950.0 at (432.4772, 3.3384), moving with a velocity of 6.2731 and an acceleration of 1.8381. Given its y-position relative to Ego and its high velocity and acceleration, an immediate collision is unlikely. Risk score: 3 (Medium risk)

* **Obstacle 3666:** Located in lanelet 948.0 at (439.4611, 5.1246), it has a velocity of 5.3819 and acceleration of 1.03. This obstacle poses some risk due to its proximity and velocity. However, the difference in y-position and Ego's acceleration suggests it can likely avoid collision. Risk score: 2 (High risk)


* **Obstacle 3667:** This obstacle is in lanelet 949.0 at (435.6788, 14.1591), very close to the Ego's lanelet.  The obstacle's velocity is 4.7787 and its acceleration is 2.0926.  While the x-position is close to the Ego, the y-position difference is significant enough that a collision is unlikely in the immediate future. Risk score: 3 (Medium risk)

* **Obstacle 3668:** At (432.1602, 14.5842) in lanelet 950, and moving with a velocity of 4.995 and acceleration of 2.3171. Similar to 3667, it's quite far in front of the Ego, so collision risk is medium. Risk score: 3 (Medium risk)

No obstacles pose an immediate collision risk (score 0 or 1).

    "IsCollisionScenario": false,
    "Reasoning": "No obstacle is predicted to collide with the Ego vehicle within the next timestep.  Obstacles 3666, 3667 and 3668 present some risk due to their proximity and velocity, but sufficient separation in the y-position exists to avoid immediate collision."
