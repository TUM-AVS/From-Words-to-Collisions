At t=11.6s, Ego (3665.0) is in lanelet 949.0 at (435.8494, 9.3969).  Several obstacles are moving, but only obstacle 3667.0 (in the same lanelet 949.0 as Ego) warrants close examination.

Obstacle 3667.0 is at (435.6788, 14.1591), also in lanelet 949.0.  Its y-coordinate is significantly ahead of Ego's, but the x-coordinates are very close.  Given obstacle 3667.0's velocity of 4.7787 and acceleration of 2.0926, and Ego's velocity of 1.7479 and acceleration of 0.3614, the risk of collision in the next few seconds is extremely high. While not an immediate collision, the rapid approach and same lanelet occupancy necessitate immediate action. Therefore, obstacle 3667.0 is classified as Extreme Risk (1).

    "OverallRiskScore": 1
  },
  "ScenarioAnalysis": {
    "IsCollisionScenario": false,
    "Reasoning": "Obstacle 3667.0 poses an Extreme Risk (score 1) due to its close proximity in x-coordinate and rapid approach to Ego within the same lanelet (949.0). While not a certain collision, the potential for collision is very high without immediate corrective action."
