### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:

- Obstacle ID: 3655.0
- Distance Risk reason:  The obstacle is in a different lanelet (2690) than the ego vehicle (949), and their y-coordinates are significantly different and diverging.  History shows the obstacle consistently moving away from the ego vehicle in the y-direction.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: The obstacle and ego vehicle have different orientations and are moving in different directions based on lanelet information and y-coordinate changes over time.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 3656.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is stationary and far from the ego vehicle in a different lanelet. The x-coordinate difference is large and remains constant throughout the provided history.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: The obstacle is stationary, posing no immediate time-related risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 3657.0

- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Stationary obstacle.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 3658.0

- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason:  Although moving, the differing lanelets and diverging trajectories based on the history indicate no time-dependent risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 3659.0
- Distance Risk reason: The obstacle is in a different lanelet (2691) and their y-coordinates are diverging over time as shown in the history.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason:  Different lanelets and diverging trajectories (based on the history) eliminate time-related risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 3660.0
- Distance Risk reason:  Stationary and far from the ego vehicle, in a different lanelet. History shows a constant large x-coordinate difference.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Stationary obstacle.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 3661.0
- Distance Risk reason:  Stationary, far from the ego vehicle, and in a different lanelet. Constant large x-coordinate difference throughout the history.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Stationary obstacle.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 3662.0
- Distance Risk reason: Although in a neighboring lanelet (950), the y-coordinates are significantly different, and the obstacle's y-position is decreasing over time, moving it further from the ego vehicle.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: The obstacle and ego vehicle are moving in similar directions, however, the difference in their y-coordinates and the lanelets minimize risk.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- Obstacle ID: 3663.0
- Distance Risk reason:  Stationary, distant, and in a different lanelet with a large and constant x-coordinate difference observed throughout the history.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Stationary obstacle.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 3664.0
- Distance Risk reason: Stationary, distant, different lanelet with a consistent large x-coordinate difference in the history.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Stationary obstacle.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 3666.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is in the same lanelet (948) and approaching the ego vehicle in the y-direction, but currently a safe distance away. The history shows it moving towards the ego vehicle's y-coordinate.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: The history shows obstacle 3666 converging towards the ego vehicle's y-coordinate. The similar orientations and the positive velocity of the obstacle suggest it's moving in the same general direction as the ego vehicle, further reducing immediate time-related risk.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- Obstacle ID: 3667.0
- Distance Risk reason: Located behind the ego vehicle, increasing distance between them.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: The obstacle is moving in a similar direction but has a greater y-coordinate and is moving further away based on the history.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 3668.0
- Distance Risk reason: Located behind and to the side of the ego vehicle, moving further away.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Located in a different lanelet and moving further away in the y-direction.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 3669.0
- Distance Risk reason: Located to the side of the ego in a different lanelet (951). The distance has remained relatively constant over the history.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Virtually stationary and not on a collision course.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5


### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. **Most critical obstacles:** Obstacle 3666 is the most critical as it's in the same lanelet (948) as the ego vehicle and approaching from behind. Obstacle 3662 requires monitoring as it's in a neighboring lanelet (950).
2. **Trajectory analysis:** Over the 10 timesteps, 3666 consistently moves closer to the ego vehicle in the y-direction.  3662 maintains a safe distance and appears to be following its lane.
3. **Relative positions, velocities, and accelerations:**  3666 has a higher y-coordinate but similar x-coordinate as the ego vehicle. Its higher velocity and acceleration imply that is getting closer faster. 3662 remains separated by a reasonable x-coordinate distance and maintains similar acceleration.
4. **Collision determination:** No collision has occurred or is immediately imminent.  However, the trends for Obstacle 3666 warrant continued monitoring.
5. **Reasoning:** While some obstacles are in adjacent lanelets or share similar x-coordinates, their different trajectories, velocities, accelerations, and separation distances (especially considering the historical trend) suggest no immediate collision risk.
