### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. **Obstacle Trajectories**: Obstacles 3662.0, 3666.0, 3667.0, and 3668.0 are moving towards the ego vehicle, but none are in immediate collision range.
2. **Distance and Time Metrics**: All obstacles have sufficient distance and time for the ego vehicle to react, with no TTC indicating imminent collision.
3. **Risk Levels**: No obstacles have a risk score of 0 (collision) or 1 (extreme risk). The highest risk is 2 (High Risk) for obstacles moving towards the ego.
