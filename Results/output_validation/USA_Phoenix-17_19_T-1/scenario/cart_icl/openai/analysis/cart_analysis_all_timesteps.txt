### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep:
Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations for timestep 11.6 seconds:

### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 3655**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is approaching the ego from the rear in the same trajectory, moving rapidly closer to the ego, with a relative velocity increase over the last few seconds.
  - **Distance safety score**: 2
  - **Time Risk reason**: High relative speed and positive acceleration indicate a rising risk of collision as the gap closes quickly.
  - **Time safety score**: 2
  - **Overall Risk score**: 2

- **Obstacle ID: 3656**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Stationary across all timesteps, position does not indicate a collision path with the ego vehicle.
  - **Distance safety score**: 5
  - **Time Risk reason**: No change in velocity, no threat presented to the ego vehicle.
  - **Time safety score**: 5
  - **Overall Risk score**: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 3657**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Stationary throughout, located to the side, not in a collision path.
  - **Distance safety score**: 5
  - **Time Risk reason**: No velocity, not progressing towards the ego vehicle.
  - **Time safety score**: 5
  - **Overall Risk score**: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 3658**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Approaching rapidly from a similar rearward trajectory; despite lateral offset, the high speed is concerning.
  - **Distance safety score**: 3
  - **Time Risk reason**: Sustained acceleration suggests increasing risk over time as it moves forwards.
  - **Time safety score**: 3
  - **Overall Risk score**: 3

- **Obstacle ID: 3659**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Moving laterally behind ego, slight negative trend in distance but remains outside immediate collision path.
  - **Distance safety score**: 4
  - **Time Risk reason**: Relatively stable velocity; expected path deviation maintains safe margins.
  - **Time safety score**: 4
  - **Overall Risk score**: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 3660**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Stationary position does not intersect with the ego path.
  - **Distance safety score**: 5
  - **Time Risk reason**: No velocity or acceleration changes, no direct threat.
  - **Time safety score**: 5
  - **Overall Risk score**: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 3661**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Holds a fixed position, removed from ego vehicle's path.
  - **Distance safety score**: 5
  - **Time Risk reason**: Static state poses no risk.
  - **Time safety score**: 5
  - **Overall Risk score**: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 3662**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: On a converging trajectory, recent acceleration increases proximity risk.
  - **Distance safety score**: 3
  - **Time Risk reason**: Increased velocity path still diverges laterally, momentarily reducing collision chances.
  - **Time safety score**: 3
  - **Overall Risk score**: 3

- **Obstacle ID: 3663**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Static, no trajectory towards the ego's path.
  - **Distance safety score**: 5
  - **Time Risk reason**: Non-moving threat; collision unlikely.
  - **Time safety score**: 5
  - **Overall Risk score**: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 3664**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Unchanging position far from ego trajectory.
  - **Distance safety score**: 5
  - **Time Risk reason**: No relative motion involved.
  - **Time safety score**: 5
  - **Overall Risk score**: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 3666**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Approaching slow but persistent shift towards the ego vehicle's space.
  - **Distance safety score**: 4
  - **Time Risk reason**: Smooth acceleration pattern does not escalate direct threat.
  - **Time safety score**: 4
  - **Overall Risk score**: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 3667**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Slight closing trajectory towards the ego vehicle in the same lanelet. 
  - **Distance safety score**: 3
  - **Time Risk reason**: Increasing speed potentially poses an issue if trends persist.
  - **Time safety score**: 3
  - **Overall Risk score**: 3

- **Obstacle ID: 3668**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Approaching from the side path but with slower lateral convergence.
  - **Distance safety score**: 4
  - **Time Risk reason**: Positive speed but calming acceleration mitigates immediate concern.
  - **Time safety score**: 4
  - **Overall Risk score**: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 3669**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: No velocity or acceleration; parked and not in trajectory path.
  - **Distance safety score**: 5
  - **Time Risk reason**: Minimal motion unlikely to affect regulations.
  - **Time safety score**: 5
  - **Overall Risk score**: 5

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
There is no collision scenario presently. The highest risk exists with obstacle 3655, due to its trajectory and acceleration pattern raising concern. However, no present risks reach a collision threshold where immediate contact is forecast. Obstacle 3655 poses a high risk, prompting heightened awareness.

### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
    "CollisionObstacles": null,
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null,
    "ScenarioAnalysis": {
        "IsCollisionScenario": false,
        "Reasoning": "While multiple obstacles show proximity trends towards the ego vehicle, none represent an immediate collision risk. The scenario mainly requires evasive anticipation against obstacle 3655, marking a high-risk observation rather than extreme."
