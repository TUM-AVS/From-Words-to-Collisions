Obstacle 3667 is located behind the ego vehicle and poses a high risk. It is very close longitudinally (-0.26m) and approaching the ego vehicle from behind (2.90 m/s), indicating a possible rear-end collision. While there is some lateral movement, it's minimal and doesn't significantly reduce the risk.  The small longitudinal distance combined with the closing velocity suggests a high probability of collision if the trajectory remains unchanged.

Obstacle 3668 is also behind the ego vehicle and presents a high risk. Its longitudinal distance is -0.86 meters, which is quite close, and its longitudinal velocity is 3.25 m/s.Although it's moving to the right, the lateral movement is minimal and doesn't eliminate the risk of a rear-end collision.

Obstacle 3656 is located in front and to the left of the ego car. The longitudinal distance is 6.82 meters, closing at -1.75 m/s. Although the distance is moderate,  this obstacle is moving towards the ego vehicle longitudinally, hence considered high risk.
