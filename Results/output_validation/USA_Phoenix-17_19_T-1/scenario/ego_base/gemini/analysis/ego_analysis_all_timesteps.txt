At t=11.6s, Obstacle 3667 is closest to the ego longitudinally at -0.26m (behind). Laterally, it's aligned with the ego at 0.00m. Its longitudinal relative velocity indicates it's approaching the ego at 3.03 m/s.  Given its proximity and speed, it poses a high risk. Obstacle 3668 is also close at -0.86m longitudinally and -1.81m laterally (rear-right), approaching at 3.25 m/s longitudinally. It is also a high risk. Obstacle 3669 is now slightly behind the ego (-0.01m longitudinally) and to the right (-5.32m laterally) and poses less of a risk given it is moving away longitudinally but it is marked as high risk as it just crossed paths with the ego and is very close. Obstacle 3656 is approaching the ego at -1.75 m/s longitudinally with a distance of 6.82m and could be a medium risk.

        "Reasoning": "No collision occurred, but obstacles 3667, 3668, and 3669 are high risk due to proximity and relative velocity. Obstacle 3656 is medium risk due to its decreasing longitudinal distance and relative velocity towards the ego vehicle."
