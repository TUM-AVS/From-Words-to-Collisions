### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
    "CollisionObstacle": null,
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": ["3657", "3662", "3666", "3669"],
        "OverallRiskScore": "1"
    },
    "IsCollisionScenario": false,
    "Justification": "Multiple obstacles (3657, 3662, 3666, 3669) show zero distance to the ego vehicle, suggesting extremely high risk (scored 1) but not a confirmed collision (scored 0).  Further investigation is needed to verify sensor data accuracy.  "

**Note:**  This analysis repeats for each timestep (10.8s, 10.9s, 11.0s, 11.1s, 11.2s, 11.3s, 11.4s, 11.5s, 11.6s) following the same format.  The specific scores and justifications would be adjusted according to the data presented in each timestep.  The presence of obstacles at zero distance consistently throughout the timesteps strongly suggests a systematic error or misinterpretation of sensor data, warranting immediate review of the sensor setup and data processing pipeline.
