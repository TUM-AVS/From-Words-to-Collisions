Let me analyze the most recent timestep (11.6 seconds) for collision risks:

### Obstacle-by-Obstacle Analysis:

1. **Obstacle 3655 (Front-right)**:
   - Moving away both longitudinally (5.91m/s) and laterally (-1.24m/s)
   - Distance: 13.77m long, -3.50m lat
   - No collision risk (score 5)

2. **Obstacle 3656 (Front-left)**:
   - Approaching longitudinally (-1.75m/s) but 6.82m away
   - Lateral distance stable at 9.11m
   - TTC: 6.82/1.75 = 3.9s (Low Risk, score 4)

3. **Obstacle 3657 (Right)**:
   - Exact longitudinal alignment but 5.46m lateral distance
   - No relative motion
   - No Risk (score 5)

4. **Obstacle 3658 (Front-right)**:
   - Moving away both dimensions (5.74m/s long, -1.22m/s lat)
   - Distance: 14.22m long, -0.06m lat
   - No Risk (score 5)

5. **Obstacle 3659 (Front-left)**:
   - Moving away longitudinally (4.67m/s) but approaching laterally (-1.02m/s)
   - Current lateral distance: 0.66m
   - TTC lateral: 0.66/1.02 = 0.65s (High Risk, score 2)
   - MDC lateral: 0.66m (High Risk, score 2)

6. **Obstacle 3660 (Front-left)**:
   - Approaching longitudinally (-1.75m/s) but 10.32m away
   - Lateral distance stable at 9.00m
   - Low Risk (score 4)

7. **Obstacle 3661 (Front-left)**:
   - Approaching longitudinally (-1.75m/s) but 13.83m away
   - Lateral distance stable at 8.90m
   - Low Risk (score 4)

8. **Obstacle 3662 (Front-right)**:
   - Moving away both dimensions (4.52m/s long, -0.28m/s lat)
   - Distance: 1.37m long, -2.06m lat
   - No Risk (score 5)

9. **Obstacle 3663 (Front-left)**:
   - Approaching longitudinally (-1.75m/s) but 17.33m away
   - Lateral distance stable at 8.79m
   - No Risk (score 5)

10. **Obstacle 3664 (Front-left)**:
    - Approaching longitudinally (-1.75m/s) but 20.83m away
    - Lateral distance stable at 8.69m
    - No Risk (score 5)

11. **Obstacle 3666 (Left)**:
    - Exact longitudinal alignment, 1.78m lateral distance
    - Approaching laterally (-0.17m/s)
    - TTC: 1.78/0.17 = 10.47s (No Risk, score 5)
    - MDC: 1.78m (Medium Risk, score 3)
    - Overall: Medium Risk (score 3)

12. **Obstacle 3667 (Behind)**:
    - Approaching from behind (3.03m/s) with -0.26m distance
    - Already overlapping longitudinally (negative distance)
    - Exact lateral alignment
    - Collision occurring (score 0)

13. **Obstacle 3668 (Rear-right)**:
    - Approaching from behind (3.25m/s) with -0.86m distance
    - Moving away laterally (-0.08m/s)
    - Overlapping longitudinally
    - Collision occurring (score 0)

14. **Obstacle 3669 (Rear-right)**:
    - Moving away both dimensions (-1.75m/s long, -0.00m/s lat)
    - Distance: -0.01m long, -5.32m lat
    - No Risk (score 5)

### Collision Scenario Determination:
- Obstacle 3667 is in collision (negative longitudinal distance, exact lateral alignment)
- Obstacle 3668 is in collision (negative longitudinal distance)

### JSON Summary:
```json
{
    "CollisionObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": ["3667", "3668"],
        "OverallRiskScore": "0"
    },
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null,
    "IsCollisionScenario": true,
    "Justification": "Obstacles 3667 and 3668 have negative longitudinal distances (-0.26m and -0.86m respectively) with exact lateral alignment (0.00m), indicating they are currently colliding with the ego vehicle from behind."
