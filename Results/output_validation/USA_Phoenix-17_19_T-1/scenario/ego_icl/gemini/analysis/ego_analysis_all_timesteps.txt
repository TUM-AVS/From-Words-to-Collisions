* **Obstacle 3655 (Front-right):**  Moving away from the ego vehicle both longitudinally and laterally. Trajectory analysis confirms this divergence. No risk of collision.
    * Risk Score: 5 (No Risk)

* **Obstacle 3656 (Front-left):**  Laterally far away and moving slightly further away. Longitudinally approaching but at a distance of 6.82m, the closing velocity is relatively low.  No immediate collision risk.
    * Risk Score: 4 (Low Risk)

* **Obstacle 3657 (Right):** Laterally separated and moving slightly further away. Longitudinally aligned but not moving relatively in that dimension. No collision risk.
    * Risk Score: 5 (No Risk)

* **Obstacle 3658 (Front-right):** Moving away longitudinally and slightly laterally from the ego vehicle. Trajectory confirms divergence. No collision risk.
    * Risk Score: 5 (No Risk)

* **Obstacle 3659 (Front-left):**  Moving away longitudinally. Laterally approaching but still at a safe distance. No immediate risk.
    * Risk Score: 4 (Low Risk)

* **Obstacle 3660 (Front-left):** Laterally far and moving further away.  Longitudinally approaching but at a safe distance with low closing velocity. No immediate collision risk.
    * Risk Score: 4 (Low Risk)

* **Obstacle 3661 (Front-left):**  Similar to 3660, far away and moving slightly further away. Longitudinally approaching but poses no immediate threat.
    * Risk Score: 4 (Low Risk)

* **Obstacle 3662 (Front-right):** Moving away longitudinally, and laterally distanced. At 1.37m longitudinal distance, even though moving away, it's still close. The lateral distance and diverging trajectories mitigate the risk. 
    * Risk Score: 3 (Medium Risk)

* **Obstacle 3663 (Front-left):** Far away and moving slightly further away. No immediate risk.
    * Risk Score: 5 (No Risk)

* **Obstacle 3664 (Front-left):** Far away and moving slightly further away. No immediate risk.
    * Risk Score: 5 (No Risk)

* **Obstacle 3666 (Left):**  Longitudinally aligned. Lateral distance is small (1.78 m) and is slightly reducing based on approaching direction.
    * TTC: 1.78m / 0.17m/s ≈ 10.47s
    * MDC: Approximately 1.78m
    * Risk Score: 3 (Medium Risk)

* **Obstacle 3667 (Behind):** Longitudinally very close and approaching rapidly from behind (-0.26m).  Laterally aligned. This represents an **extreme risk**.
    * TTC: 0.26m / 3.03m/s ≈ 0.09s
    * MDC: Approximately 0.26m
    * Risk Score: 1 (Extreme Risk)

* **Obstacle 3668 (Rear-right):**  Approaching from behind and slightly to the right. Longitudinal distance is small (-0.86m) and closing. Lateral distance is small but increasing. The longitudinal movement poses the primary risk.
    * TTC: 0.86m/3.25m/s ≈ 0.26s
    * MDC: < 0.86m (due to the rightward movement)
    * Risk Score: 1 (Extreme Risk)

* **Obstacle 3669 (Rear-right):**  Moving away longitudinally, though currently very close (-0.01m), thus no longitudinal collision risk at this point. Lateral separation also increasing.
    * Risk Score: 5 (No Risk)


**Conclusion:**

This IS a collision scenario because obstacles 3667 and 3668 both pose extreme risks (Risk Score 1) with very low TTCs and close proximity, indicating near-certain collision within the next timestep unless immediate evasive action is taken.
