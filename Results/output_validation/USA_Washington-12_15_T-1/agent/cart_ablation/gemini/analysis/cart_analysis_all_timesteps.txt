Here's the collision risk analysis:

**Analysis:**

* **Obstacle 30604:** This obstacle enters the scenario late and maintains a safe lateral distance from the ego vehicle.  It poses no immediate threat. Risk score: 5 - Negligible risk.

* **Obstacle 30606:** This obstacle is in a different lane and moving faster than the ego vehicle. It does not pose a collision risk. Risk score: 5 - Negligible risk.

* **Obstacle 30610:** This obstacle is stationary in the same lane as the ego vehicle, directly ahead. Given the ego vehicle's deceleration, this obstacle presents a high risk of collision.  Risk score: 2 - High Risk

* **Obstacle 30613:** This obstacle is almost stationary in the same lane as the ego vehicle and very close. Given the ego vehicle's trajectory, this obstacle represents an immediate collision risk. Risk score: 1 - Extreme Risk.

* **Obstacle 30614:**  This obstacle is in the same lane as the ego vehicle and is moving slowly. While closer than 30610, it is still far enough away to allow for reaction time. Risk score: 2 - High Risk

* **Obstacle 30626:** This obstacle is in a different lane and is moving away from the ego vehicle, posing no risk. Risk score: 5 - Negligible risk
