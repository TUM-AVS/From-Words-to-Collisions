Here's an analysis of the scenario and the resulting JSON:

**Analysis:**

* **Obstacle 30604:**  This obstacle appears at 2.2 seconds and is initially somewhat distant from the ego vehicle and in a different lanelet (2235 vs. ego's 985). While its velocity is moderately high, its trajectory doesn't appear to directly intersect with the ego vehicle's path in the near future.  Therefore, it poses a low risk (4).

* **Obstacle 30606:** This obstacle is in a different lanelet (984) and moving with a high velocity.  Its trajectory seems parallel to the ego vehicle but with a safe lateral separation. It is unlikely to collide and is classified as a low to medium risk (3-4).

* **Obstacle 30610:** This obstacle is stationary in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle, but it's significantly ahead and poses no immediate threat. Its risk level is negligible (5).

* **Obstacle 30613:** This obstacle is almost stationary and located in the ego vehicle's lanelet, but its position is consistently ahead of the ego vehicle. Given the ego vehicle's decelerating behavior, it's unlikely to collide, although caution is needed. Risk is medium (3).

* **Obstacle 30614:** This obstacle is in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle and moving slowly. Its position is also ahead of the ego and the ego vehicle is decelerating.  This represents a low risk (4).

* **Obstacle 30626:** This obstacle is in a different lanelet (986) and moving with a moderate velocity. The lateral separation is significant, and its trajectory doesn't appear to pose a risk to the ego vehicle.  It's assessed as a low risk (4).
