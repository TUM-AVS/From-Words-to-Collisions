Let's analyze the scenario by focusing on the most recent timestep (2.8 seconds).

### Analysis:

1. **Ego Vehicle**:
   - Position: (-141.1008, -114.4548)
   - Velocity: 1.8781 m/s, decelerating (so it's slowing down).

2. **Obstacles**:
   - **Obstacle 30606.0**:  
     - Position: (-144.6738, -102.0044)
     - Velocity: 12.0692 m/s, the fastest among obstacles, and is accelerating. 
     - This obstacle is moving along its path away from its initial position faster and is not directly in the path of the Ego.
     - Current lanelet differs from Ego, unlikely immediate threat.
   
   - **Obstacle 30626.0**:  
     - Position: (-137.678, -95.1039)
     - Velocity: 2.6793 m/s, decreasing speed significantly.
     - Distance from Ego: approximately along a different lanelet path than Ego, suggesting no immediate collision course.

   - **Stationary Obstacles (30610.0, 30613.0, 30614.0)**:
     - These obstacles have low speeds indicating they are either completely stationary or moving at a very low pace, unlikely to pose immediate threats.
     - Their positions are consistent over the timesteps with low velocities and deceleration values indicating little to no relative motion towards Ego.

   - **Obstacle 30604.0**:
     - Position: (-148.1767, -92.5109)
     - Agency to change lanelet position, unlikely to pose immediate invasive maneuver risk to Ego given differing paths.

Based on this analysis, no obstacle seems to present an imminent collision risk with the Ego. However, if continued trends over several seconds were sustained without any intervention or steering adjustments by the Ego, there could still potentially be reversible situations due to proximity with stationary or slow-moving vehicles.

### JSON Output:

```json
{
    "CollisionObstacles": [],
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": null,
        "OverallRiskScore": null
    },
    "HighRiskObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": null,
        "OverallRiskScore": null
    }
}
```

In this scenario, no obstacle explicitly qualifies for collision (0) or extreme risk (1), and no high-risk obstacle (2) was identified. The distances and differing lanelet paths provided sufficient separation, and no obstacle trajectory indicated imminent movement towards the Ego's path within this timeframe.
