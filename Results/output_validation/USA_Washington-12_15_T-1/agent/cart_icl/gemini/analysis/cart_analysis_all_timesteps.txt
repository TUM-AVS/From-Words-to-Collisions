At timestep 2.8s, obstacle 30610 is stationary in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle, and the ego vehicle is approaching it while decelerating. This presents a high risk of collision if the ego vehicle does not stop or change lanes. Obstacle 30613 and 30614 are also in the same lanelet and relatively close, though not as immediately concerning as 30610. Obstacle 30606 is in a different lanelet and moving faster than ego, posing less of a risk, and Obstacle 30626, in yet another lanelet, is also less of a risk.
