### Analysis of the Scenario:

- **Ego vehicle (30628 at 2.8 seconds):**
  - Position: (-141.1008, -114.4548)
  - Velocity: 1.8781 m/s
  - Trajectory indicates consistent deceleration.

- **Obstacle 30606 (at 2.8 seconds):**
  - Position: (-144.6738, -102.0044), Lanelet 984.0
  - Velocity: 12.0692 m/s
  - Moving rapidly with moderate acceleration.
  - Longitudinal position relative to Ego: approximately -12.5 meters (ahead).
  - The obstacle is faster, but not in the same lanelet; risk is lower.

- **Obstacle 30610 (at 2.8 seconds):**
  - **Stationary Obstacle**
  - Position: (-141.1784, -94.4209), Lanelet 985.0
  - Relative distance to Ego: approximately -20 meters (ahead, same lanelet).
  - Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC) is reducing; however, since Ego is decelerating, it can still avoid collision.
  - **Risk Level: Medium (3)** due to constant risk management needed.

- **Obstacle 30613 (at 2.8 seconds):**
  - Position: (-141.174, -101.9317), Lanelet 985.0
  - Slowly moving but not immediately concerning due to low velocity.

- **Obstacle 30614 (at 2.8 seconds):**
  - Position: (-141.1696, -109.4951), Lanelet 985.0
  - Relative distance: Approximately -5 meters (ahead, same lanelet).
  - Low velocity mitigates risk, but close proximity requires awareness.

- **Obstacle 30626 (at 2.8 seconds):**
  - Position: (-137.678, -95.1039), Lanelet 986.0
  - Velocity: 2.6793 m/s
  - Positioned in a different lanelet; risk to Ego is negligible.

### JSON Output:

```json
{
    "CollisionObstacles": [],
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {},
    "HighRiskObstacle": {}
}
```

### Summary:

- No obstacles currently pose immediate collision risk (0 or 1).
- Obstacle 30610 represents the highest ongoing risk necessitating frequent monitoring and potentially active maneuvers to ensure safety, thus classified under Medium Risk (not included in JSON as per instructions).
- Overall, the situation remains under control with vigilant monitoring.
