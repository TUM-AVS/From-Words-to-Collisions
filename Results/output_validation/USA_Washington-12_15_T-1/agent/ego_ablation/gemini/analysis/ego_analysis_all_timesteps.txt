At timestamp 2.8 seconds, Obstacle 30614 poses an extreme risk of collision with the ego vehicle. It is located directly in front of the ego car at a very close longitudinal distance of 0.45 meters.  The relative longitudinal velocity indicates it is moving towards the ego vehicle, suggesting an imminent collision if the trajectories are maintained. Considering the provided thresholds, the MDC and TTC values for Obstacle 30614 would likely fall into the "Extreme Risk" category (MDC ≤ 0.5 m, TTC ≤ 0.5 s), resulting in an overall risk score of 1. While other obstacles are driving toward the ego car longitudinally, their distances and relative velocities suggest sufficient time to react, placing them in lower risk categories than Obstacle 30614.
