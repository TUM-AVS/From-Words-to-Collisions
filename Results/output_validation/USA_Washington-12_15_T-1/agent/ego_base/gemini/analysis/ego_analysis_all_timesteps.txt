Obstacle 30604: This obstacle is located in the Front-left, with a longitudinal distance of 17.41m and a lateral distance of 5.54m. It's moving towards the ego vehicle longitudinally at -10.73 m/s and laterally at -0.02 m/s.  The lateral movement suggests it is slightly moving towards the ego vehicle. Given the distances and relative velocities, this obstacle presents a low risk (Risk Score: 4).

Obstacle 30606: This obstacle is in the Front-left at a longitudinal distance of 7.93m and a lateral distance of 2.00m. It's approaching the ego vehicle longitudinally at -13.95 m/s and laterally at -0.05 m/s.  While the lateral movement is slight, the closing longitudinal speed and relatively small distance warrants attention. This obstacle represents a medium risk. (Risk Score 3).

Obstacle 30610: This obstacle is in front of the ego vehicle at a longitudinal distance of 15.53m. It's closing in at -1.88 m/s longitudinally. While directly ahead, the closing speed is low and the distance is moderate. This obstacle is classified as a low risk. (Risk Score 4).

Obstacle 30613:  Located in front of the ego vehicle at a longitudinal distance of 8.01m, this obstacle is moving towards the ego vehicle at -1.87 m/s longitudinally. The decreasing distance warrants attention, classifying this as a medium risk. (Risk Score 3).

Obstacle 30614: This obstacle is directly in front of the ego vehicle, only 0.45m away, and closing at -1.81 m/s longitudinally. This very close proximity and closing speed make this an extreme risk of collision. (Risk Score: 1).

Obstacle 30626: Located in the Front-right, this obstacle is 14.85m away longitudinally and -1.75m laterally. It's moving away longitudinally at 0.8 m/s but slightly towards the ego car laterally at 0.01 m/s.  The longitudinal movement poses little risk, but the lateral movement warrants monitoring. Overall, it's low risk. (Risk Score 4).


Risk Levels:
0: Collision - Physical contact occurred or unavoidable
1: Extreme Risk - Immediate collision likely
2: High Risk - Close to collision, needs quick action
3: Medium Risk - Manageable with proper reaction
4: Low Risk - Minimal risk, sufficient time to react
5: Negligible Risk - No significant risk
