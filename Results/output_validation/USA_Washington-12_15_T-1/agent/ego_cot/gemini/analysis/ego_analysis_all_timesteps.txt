### Safety analysis for timestep 2.8 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

**Assumptions and Clarifications:**

* Since adjusted distances (adjusted_d_long, adjusted_d_lat) are not provided in the context, the given real distance values (DTClong, DTClat) will be used for analysis.  This is not ideal, as vehicle size isn't accounted for, leading to potentially less accurate risk assessments.  It is *strongly* recommended to include adjusted distances in future scenario descriptions.
* Lateral movement is assumed less critical than longitudinal movement when both TTC and MDC are within the same risk category. This is because steering adjustments are generally faster and easier to execute than braking or acceleration. 
* We're treating "Exact lateral alignment or unknown case" as potentially risky. In a real-world scenario, further sensor data would be needed to clarify.


### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 30604**
    - Distance Risk reason:  Located at 17.41m longitudinally and 17.41m laterally (Front-Left).  Relatively far, posing no immediate threat.
    - Distance safety score: 5
    - Time Risk reason: Approaching longitudinally at -10.73 m/s.  TTC would need to be calculated, but given the distance, it's likely >5s.
    - Time safety score: 5
    - Overall Risk score: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 30606**
    - Distance Risk reason: Located at 7.93m longitudinally and 7.93m laterally (Front-Left). Moderate proximity requires monitoring.
    - Distance safety score: 4
    - Time Risk reason: Approaching longitudinally at -13.95 m/s.  TTC is likely in the medium to low risk range.
    - Time safety score: 3 or 4 
    - Overall Risk score: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 30610**
    - Distance Risk reason: Located at 15.53m longitudinally and 15.53m laterally (Front). Relatively safe distance currently.
    - Distance safety score: 5
    - Time Risk reason: Approaching at -1.88 m/s longitudinally.  TTC is likely high, but warrants monitoring due to the "exact lateral alignment" uncertainty.
    - Time safety score: 4 or 5
    - Overall Risk score: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 30613**
    - Distance Risk reason: Located at 8.01m longitudinally and 8.01m laterally (Front). Moderate proximity requires attention.
    - Distance safety score: 4
    - Time Risk reason: Approaching at -1.87 m/s longitudinally. TTC is likely in a safer range than 30606, but still needs monitoring given the lateral alignment ambiguity.
    - Time safety score: 4
    - Overall Risk score: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 30614**
    - Distance Risk reason: Extremely close at 0.45m longitudinally and 0.45m laterally (Front). Imminent collision likely.
    - Distance safety score: 1
    - Time Risk reason: Approaching at -1.81 m/s longitudinally. TTC is extremely low, indicating a near-certain collision if the trajectory isn't altered immediately.
    - Time safety score: 1
    - Overall Risk score: 1

- **Obstacle ID: 30626**
    - Distance Risk reason: Located at 14.85m longitudinally and 14.85m laterally (Front-Right).  Relatively safe distance.
    - Distance safety score: 5
    - Time Risk reason:  Moving away longitudinally at 0.80 m/s. Poses no longitudinal risk. Lateral movement needs further investigation due to its mention of "driving towards the ego car laterally."
    - Time safety score: 5
    - Overall Risk score: 5
