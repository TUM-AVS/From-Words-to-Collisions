Obstacles 30613 and 30614 are in the same lane as the ego vehicle, and relatively close. Obstacle 30610 is also in the ego vehicle's lane. However, at the last timestep (t=3.0s), the positions and velocities suggest low risk of collision in the immediate future.

Obstacle 30610 is stationary and positioned laterally near the ego vehicle, but not close enough to represent an immediate collision risk.  Obstacles 30613 and 30614 have minimal velocities, and their positions relative to the ego vehicle suggest they are slightly ahead and not converging rapidly enough to cause an immediate collision. The ego vehicle is decelerating, further reducing the risk.

Obstacle 30606 is in a different lane and moving with high velocity and high positive acceleration. It does not represent an immediate collision risk. Obstacle 30604 is also located in a different lane, is far away longitudinally, and its trajectory is not intersecting with the ego vehicle's path imminently. Obstacle 30626, although in a nearby lane, is moving away from the ego vehicle and hence poses no immediate threat.

Therefore, no obstacles present an immediate collision risk.
