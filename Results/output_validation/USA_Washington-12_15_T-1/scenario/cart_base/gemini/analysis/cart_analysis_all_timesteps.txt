At t=3.0s, Ego is in lanelet 985.0 at (-141.1008, -114.079) with a velocity of 1.6163 m/s.

Obstacle 30610 is stationary in the same lanelet at (-141.1784, -94.4209).  While it's in the same lanelet, it's significantly ahead of the ego vehicle and poses no immediate risk.

Obstacles 30613 and 30614 are also in the same lanelet and moving very slowly.  30613 is at (-141.174, -101.9299) and 30614 at (-141.1696, -109.4835). Although they are closer to the ego vehicle than 30610, their slow speeds and positions relative to the ego, suggest they are not immediate collision risks within the next few moments.  Observing past trajectories strengthens this assessment.

Obstacle 30606 is in lanelet 984.0 at (-144.6725, -104.4758) with a velocity of 12.4969 m/s.  Its trajectory shows it moving towards the ego vehicle's lanelet and fast. This presents a potential risk in subsequent timesteps but doesn't pose an *immediate* collision risk.

Obstacle 30626, while in a different lane (986.0), is also moving considerably slower than prior timesteps.  At (-137.6783, -94.6939), it's unlikely to pose an immediate risk based on its current dynamics and past trajectory.

Obstacle 30604 is in lanelet 983.0 at (-148.177, -94.318) moving at 9.1304. This one is far and based on the lanelet, not likely to be an issue.

Given the current positions, velocities, and trajectories, no obstacle presents an immediate (risk score 1) or collision (risk score 0) risk at t=3.0s.

Obstacles 30613, 30614 and 30610 are in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle, but sufficiently far ahead and/or slow-moving. Obstacle 30606 in the adjacent lanelet is moving fast, requiring monitoring in future timesteps. Obstacles 30604 and 30626 are in different lanelets and pose no immediate risk."
