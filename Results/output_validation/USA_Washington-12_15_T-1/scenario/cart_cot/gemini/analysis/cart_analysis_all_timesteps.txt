### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 30604.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 30604.0 is in a different lanelet and its X position is moving further away from the ego vehicle over time.  The historical trajectory confirms it poses no immediate threat.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason:  The obstacle's velocity and acceleration are not directed towards the ego vehicle's path based on the provided data. The history shows consistent movement away from the ego vehicle.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 30606.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 30606.0 is in a different lanelet and is moving away from the ego vehicle, based on both current position and historical trajectory.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: The obstacle's velocity and acceleration indicate movement away from the ego vehicle, further reducing risk. This trend is consistent throughout the provided history.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 30610.0
- Distance Risk reason: Although in the same lanelet, Obstacle 30610.0 is significantly ahead of the ego vehicle and stationary.  Historical data confirms it has remained stationary.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason:  Since the obstacle is stationary and far ahead, there's no time-based risk of collision.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 30613.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 30613.0 is in the same lanelet and is ahead of the ego vehicle but at a safe distance.  The historical data shows it moving very slowly.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason:  The obstacle's minimal velocity and acceleration don't pose a significant time-dependent risk given the current distance. The historical data supports this assessment.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- Obstacle ID: 30614.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 30614.0 is in the same lanelet, ahead of the ego, but its distance suggests a low risk. The historical data supports this.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Although it is moving slowly, its velocity and acceleration are not towards the ego vehicle, resulting in minimal time-based risk. The history confirms a consistent pattern.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- Obstacle ID: 30626.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 30626.0 is in a different lanelet and its x-coordinate is moving further away over time, reducing the risk. The historical trajectory shows consistent separation.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: The obstacle's movement, while in a different lanelet, is directed away from the ego vehicle, further minimizing time-based risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5



### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. **Most critical obstacles:** Obstacles 30613.0 and 30614.0 are the most critical because they share the same lanelet as the ego vehicle.

2. **Trajectory analysis:** Over the 10 timesteps, both 30613.0 and 30614.0 remain ahead of the ego vehicle. While they are moving, their velocity and acceleration are relatively small and not indicative of a closing trajectory towards the ego vehicle.

3. **Relative position, velocity, and acceleration:** The ego vehicle is decelerating, while the other two obstacles in the same lanelet are moving very slowly. The relative distance between the ego and these obstacles remains safe throughout the observed period.

4. **Collision determination:** No collision has occurred, nor is one imminent based on the provided data.

5. **Reasoning:** The combination of distance, relative velocity, and acceleration suggests a low risk of collision. The obstacles' trajectories and the ego vehicle's deceleration contribute to maintaining a safe distance over the observed period.
