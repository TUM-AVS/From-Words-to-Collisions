### Safety Analysis for the Most Recent Timestep (3.0 seconds):

#### Key Observations:
1. **Ego Vehicle**: Moving at 1.6163 m/s with deceleration (-0.642 m/sÂ²) in lanelet 985.0, position (-141.1008, -114.079).
2. **Obstacles in Same Lanelet (985.0)**:
   - 30610.0: Stationary at (-141.1784, -94.4209)
   - 30613.0: Moving slowly at (0.0083 m/s) towards ego
   - 30614.0: Moving slowly at (0.0545 m/s) towards ego
3. **Obstacles in Adjacent Lanelets**:
   - 30606.0: High speed (12.4969 m/s) in lanelet 984.0 (parallel lane)
   - 30626.0: Decelerating (1.6715 m/s) in lanelet 986.0 (opposite direction)

#### Critical Obstacles:
- **30606.0**: High-speed obstacle in adjacent lane (984.0) moving parallel to ego. Distance ~10m laterally, but trajectory shows consistent movement away from ego's path.
- **30626.0**: Decelerating in opposite lane (986.0), but trajectory shows it's moving away from ego's position.

### Obstacle Analysis (Most Recent Timestep):

#### Obstacle 30606.0:
- **Distance Risk**: Parallel movement in adjacent lane, safe lateral separation (~10m).  
  **Score**: 4 (Low Risk)
- **Time Risk**: High speed but moving away. TTC > 5s.  
  **Score**: 4 (Low Risk)
- **Overall**: 4

#### Obstacle 30626.0:
- **Distance Risk**: Opposite lane, moving away.  
  **Score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- **Time Risk**: Decelerating, no convergence.  
  **Score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- **Overall**: 5

#### Obstacle 30610.0:
- **Distance Risk**: Stationary, ~20m ahead in same lane.  
  **Score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- **Time Risk**: No motion.  
  **Score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- **Overall**: 5

*(Other obstacles are either stationary or moving away with negligible risk.)*

### Chain of Thought:
1. No obstacles are in direct collision path (all either stationary, moving away, or in non-conflicting lanes).
2. Closest dynamic obstacle (30606.0) is in parallel lane with safe lateral separation.
3. Ego is decelerating, reducing risk further.
