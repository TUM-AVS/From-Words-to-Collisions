### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep (3.0 seconds): Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:
- **Obstacle ID: 30604.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is in a different lanelet and moving away from the ego vehicle.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason:  Relative velocities and trajectories indicate no risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5
- **Obstacle ID: 30606.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is in a different lanelet and moving away from the ego vehicle.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Relative velocities and trajectories indicate no risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5
- **Obstacle ID: 30610.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Stationary and laterally offset from ego, no immediate risk.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Stationary, poses no immediate time-based risk.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4
- **Obstacle ID: 30613.0**

- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: Almost stationary, poses low time-based risk.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3
- **Obstacle ID: 30614.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Stationary and approaching the ego longitudinally
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Almost stationary.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4
- **Obstacle ID: 30626.0**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is in a different lanelet and moving away from the ego vehicle.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Relative velocities and trajectories indicate no risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5


### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
No obstacles are on a direct collision course with the ego vehicle.  The ego vehicle is decelerating within its lane. Obstacle 30610, 30613, and 30614 are either stationary or slow-moving and present minimal risk due to their positions and low velocities. Other obstacles are in different lanelets and moving away.  Therefore, this is not a collision scenario.
