### Obstacle Analysis for the Most Recent Timestep (3.0 seconds):

1. **Obstacle ID: 30610.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle remains stationary for all timesteps. It is in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle, but the consistent lack of movement results in minimal impact to the ego's immediate path.
   - **Distance safety score**: 4
   - **Time Risk reason**: History shows zero velocity and acceleration, posing low immediate threat unless ego's trajectory dramatically changes towards it.
   - **Time safety score**: 4
   - **Overall Risk score**: 4

2. **Obstacle ID: 30613.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Position variance is minimal over time and it stays within lanelet 985.0, indicating a stable and low-risk trajectory regarding distance from the ego vehicle.
   - **Distance safety score**: 4
   - **Time Risk reason**: Consistent low velocity and deceleration trend suggest controlled movement with limited threat to ego's trajectory.
   - **Time safety score**: 4
   - **Overall Risk score**: 4

3. **Obstacle ID: 30614.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Progresses steadily and predictably in both position and orientation. Sufficient distance is maintained from the ego vehicle.
   - **Distance safety score**: 4
   - **Time Risk reason**: Perceptible deceleration with stable low velocity implies a controlled, low-risk float, safe from impacting the ego vehicle.
   - **Time safety score**: 4
   - **Overall Risk score**: 4

4. **Obstacle ID: 30626.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Located in a different lanelet and following a declining speed trend, it poses little danger as it seems to be moving away longitudinally.
   - **Distance safety score**: 5
   - **Time Risk reason**: Significant braking is observed, indicative of reducing speed and therefore reducing potential alignment with the ego vehicle.
   - **Time safety score**: 5
   - **Overall Risk score**: 5

5. **Obstacle ID: 30604.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Positioned in a separate lanelet from the ego vehicle's trajectory and consistently moves further downhill relative to the ego’s path.
   - **Distance safety score**: 5
   - **Time Risk reason**: The steady acceleration suggests that this obstacle will maintain its speed away from the ego vehicle, with no immediate threat.
   - **Time safety score**: 5
   - **Overall Risk score**: 5
   
6. **Obstacle ID: 30606.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Initially accelerating upward, but maintains a considerable separation from the ego.
   - **Distance safety score**: 5
   - **Time Risk reason**: The consistent acceleration suggests it will continue moving away from the ego vehicle's path. Given the ego’s placement, risk remains low.
   - **Time safety score**: 5
   - **Overall Risk score**: 5

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
- No obstacles show an immediate overlap or exhibit a high-intersection trajectory with the ego vehicle.
- The distances between the ego and most critical static and moving obstacles remain large enough to mitigate imminent collision risk.
- Stable or declining speed trends among most moving obstacles signify a reducing interaction risk over the evaluated timespan.
- Hence, this scenario does not present an immediate collision risk to the ego vehicle.
