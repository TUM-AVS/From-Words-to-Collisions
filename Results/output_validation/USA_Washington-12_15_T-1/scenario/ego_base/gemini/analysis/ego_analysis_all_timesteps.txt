At t=3.0s, Obstacle 30614 is only 0.09m in front of the ego vehicle and moving at -1.56 m/s relative longitudinal velocity. This indicates an unavoidable collision in the next timestep. Obstacle 30606 is also quite close at 5.09m longitudinally and 1.97m laterally, approaching at -14.11 m/s longitudinally. While not an immediate collision, it presents a very high risk.  Obstacle 30604, at 15.25m and closing at -10.75m/s, represents a high risk. Obstacle 30626, while laterally close and moving towards the ego, is moving away longitudinally and presents less of an immediate risk. Obstacles 30610 and 30613 are further away and represent lower risks at this time step.


**Risk Levels and Definitions:**
<Collision (Score: 0)>: Actual collision has occurred or is unavoidable within the next timestep.
<Extreme Risk (Score: 1)>: Immediate collision or very high likelihood of impact. Urgent action is required.
<High Risk (Score: 2)>: Close to collision or highly probable collision path. Needs prompt attention and quick manoeuvring.
<Medium Risk (Score: 3)>: Moderate collision risk but manageable with timely reactions and proper strategies.
<Low Risk (Score: 4)>: Minimal collision risk. The situation is controllable with sufficient time to react.
<Negligible Risk (Score: 5)>: No significant collision risk. Obstacles are either moving away or far enough not to interfere.
