### Safety analysis for timestep 3.0 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

**A crucial piece of information is missing: the adjusted distances (adjusted_d_long and adjusted_d_lat).**  The prompt explicitly states that these adjusted values *must* be used for accurate risk assessment.  Since they aren't provided, I'll make reasonable assumptions based on the raw distances, but the results will be less precise.  I will assume the ego vehicle and obstacles are roughly the same width, and that the lateral distances are center-to-center.

**Methodology:**  Without adjusted distances, I will estimate TTC by dividing the longitudinal distance by the relative longitudinal velocity. A negative TTC indicates the obstacle is approaching.  I will primarily focus on longitudinal TTC as the primary collision risk indicator due to the "Front" designation of the most critical obstacles. I will treat very small TTC values (<0.5s) as extremely high risk and imminent collision. Lateral movement will be considered as a secondary factor.
