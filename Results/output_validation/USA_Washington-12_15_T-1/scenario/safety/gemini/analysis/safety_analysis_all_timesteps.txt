### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 30604
- Relative Direction: Front-left
- Distance Risk Reason:  Longitudinal distance is moderately far, but lateral distance is medium, resulting in a medium distance risk given the front-left direction. The trend shows the longitudinal distance decreasing and the lateral distance initially increasing then slightly decreasing.
- Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 5
- Lateral Distance Safety Score: 4
- Overall Distance Safety Score: 4.5
- Time Risk Reason:  Longitudinal TTC is medium, while lateral TTC is negligible, suggesting a medium time risk overall. The longitudinal TTC has been generally decreasing over time, while the lateral TTC has varied significantly.
- Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 3
- Lateral Time Safety Score: 5
- Overall Time Safety Score: 4
- Overall Risk Score: 4

- Obstacle ID: 30606
- Relative Direction: Front-left
- Distance Risk Reason: Both longitudinal and lateral distances are medium, indicating a medium distance risk, influenced by the front-left direction. The trend shows longitudinal distance decreasing and lateral distance increasing initially then remaining somewhat steady.
- Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 4
- Lateral Distance Safety Score: 3
- Overall Distance Safety Score: 3.5
- Time Risk Reason: Longitudinal TTC indicates extreme risk, while lateral TTC indicates a low risk. Combined with the front-left direction, this poses a high time risk. The longitudinal TTC has been consistently decreasing, while the lateral TTC started very high and has decreased.
- Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 1
- Lateral Time Safety Score: 4
- Overall Time Safety Score: 2.5
- Overall Risk Score: 3

- Obstacle ID: 30610
- Relative Direction: Front
- Distance Risk Reason:  Longitudinal distance is large, posing no lateral risk as expected for a front direction obstacle. The trend shows longitudinal distance decreasing.
- Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 5
- Lateral Distance Safety Score: 5
- Overall Distance Safety Score: 5.0
- Time Risk Reason:  Longitudinal TTC is negligible risk, while lateral TTC indicates a collision risk.  Given the obstacle is directly in front, the longitudinal component dominates. The trend for longitudinal TTC shows it increasing.
- Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 5
- Lateral Time Safety Score: 0
- Overall Time Safety Score: 5
- Overall Risk Score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 30613
- Relative Direction: Front
- Distance Risk Reason: Longitudinal distance is medium, posing no lateral risk as expected with a front direction. The trend shows longitudinal distance is decreasing.
- Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 4
- Lateral Distance Safety Score: 5
- Overall Distance Safety Score: 4
- Time Risk Reason: Longitudinal TTC represents medium risk, with no lateral TTC risk as the obstacle is directly in front. The longitudinal TTC has slightly increased but remains a concern.
- Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 3
- Lateral Time Safety Score: 0
- Overall Time Safety Score: 3
- Overall Risk Score: 4

- Obstacle ID: 30614
- Relative Direction: Front
- Distance Risk Reason: Longitudinal distance is extremely close, posing an extreme collision risk. There is no lateral risk as expected from a front direction. The trend shows a rapidly decreasing longitudinal distance.
- Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 1
- Lateral Distance Safety Score: 5
- Overall Distance Safety Score: 1.0
- Time Risk Reason: Longitudinal TTC indicates extreme risk, with no lateral TTC information for front obstacles. The consistently decreasing longitudinal TTC trend indicates imminent collision.
- Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 1
- Lateral Time Safety Score: 0
- Overall Time Safety Score: 1.0
- Overall Risk Score: 1

- Obstacle ID: 30626
- Relative Direction: Front-right
- Distance Risk Reason:  Longitudinal distance is large, while lateral distance is medium. Given the front-right direction, the combined distance risk is low.  The trend shows longitudinal distance increasing slightly, and lateral distance increasing.
- Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 5
- Lateral Distance Safety Score: 4
- Overall Distance Safety Score: 4.5
- Time Risk Reason: Longitudinal TTC indicates negligible risk, while the lateral TTC suggests a medium risk. This results in a low overall time risk considering the front-right direction. The trend shows lateral TTC has significantly decreased, raising concerns.
- Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 5
- Lateral Time Safety Score: 3
- Overall Time Safety Score: 4.0
- Overall Risk Score: 4
