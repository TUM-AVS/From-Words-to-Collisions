Here's the collision risk analysis:

**Analysis:**

Obstacle 30604: This vehicle is in a different lane and maintains a safe lateral distance from the ego vehicle.  The trajectories show no sign of convergence, indicating negligible risk. Risk score: 5

Obstacle 30605: This vehicle appears at 2.7 seconds and is far from the ego vehicle, posing no immediate threat. Risk score: 5

Obstacle 30606: Similar to 30604, this vehicle is in a different lane and maintains a safe lateral distance. No risk of collision is observed. Risk score: 5

Obstacle 30610: This stationary obstacle is in a different lane and poses no risk. Risk score: 5

Obstacle 30613:  Located in lanelet 985, this obstacle is almost stationary and far from the ego vehicle's trajectory in lanelet 986. Risk score: 5

Obstacle 30614: Similar to 30613, this obstacle is almost stationary and located in lanelet 985. It poses no collision risk. Risk score: 5

Obstacle 30628: Though in the same lanelet (985) as some other static/slow-moving obstacles, this vehicle is moving slowly and is positioned behind the ego vehicle. Its slow speed and the ego vehicle's current trajectory suggest a low risk of collision. Risk score: 4.

Obstacle 30629: This vehicle is the most critical. It's in the same lane (986) as the ego vehicle and its trajectory shows it approaching the ego vehicle from behind at a higher speed than obstacle 30628. While not an immediate collision risk, the closing distance warrants attention and a high risk assessment. Risk score: 2
