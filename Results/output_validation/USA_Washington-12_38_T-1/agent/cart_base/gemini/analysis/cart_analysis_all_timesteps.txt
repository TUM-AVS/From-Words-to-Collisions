Obstacle 30604: This obstacle is in a different lanelet (983) than the ego vehicle (986), and its x-coordinate remains significantly different from the ego vehicle's x-coordinate throughout the provided timesteps.  The trajectories suggest no immediate risk of collision. Risk score: 5

Obstacle 30605: This obstacle appears at t=2.7s and remains stationary far from the ego vehicle. Risk score: 5

Obstacle 30606: Similar to 30604, this obstacle is in a different lanelet (984) and maintains a safe x-coordinate distance from the ego vehicle. Risk score: 5

Obstacle 30610: Stationary and far from the ego vehicle. Risk score: 5

Obstacle 30613:  Stationary and located in lanelet 985.  While in the same general y-coordinate area as the ego vehicle at some points, the x-coordinate difference suggests no imminent collision risk. Risk score: 5

Obstacle 30614: Located in lanelet 985.  Moves very slowly and while its y-coordinate gets closer to the ego vehicle's, the x-coordinate difference makes a collision unlikely. Risk score: 5

Obstacle 30628: Located in lanelet 985.  The y-coordinate indicates it's behind the ego vehicle, and its x-coordinate suggests it's unlikely to collide. Risk score: 5

Obstacle 30629: This obstacle is in the same lanelet (986) as the ego vehicle. Its y-coordinate is initially much higher than the ego's but decreases over time, suggesting it's approaching from behind. The x-coordinates also get closer, though they never equal each other. However, the closing velocities and acceleration differences warrant close attention. Since there isn't a definitive collision in the presented data, but the closing distance and speeds raise concern, this is categorized as a high risk. Risk score: 2
