Obstacle 30629 is showing concerning behavior. It's in the same lane as the ego vehicle and its velocity is rapidly decreasing while also being quite close to the ego vehicle, indicating a possible emergency braking situation or other erratic behavior.  While a collision isn't imminent in the next second, the rapid deceleration warrants close monitoring and a high-risk assessment. Obstacle 30606, while further away and in a different lanelet, also exhibits consistently increasing velocity and poses a medium risk due to its proximity. Obstacle 30604 continues to accelerate further from ego and the static parked vehicles (30610, 30613, 30614) are very unlikely to interfere with ego and therefore categorized as Negligible Risk.
