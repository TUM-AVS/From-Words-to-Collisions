### Brief Analysis

In the context of the most recent timestep at 3.1 seconds, I will focus on the observed data from the ego vehicle and the obstacles. The goal is to determine the risk levels of each obstacle concerning the ego vehicle's trajectory.

**Key Observations:**

1. **Ego Vehicle (30630)**
   - Position: (-137.5379, -100.6187)
   - Velocity: 7.386

2. **Obstacle 30604**
   - Position: (-148.1677, -112.5659)
   - Velocity: 13.4752
   - This obstacle is moving parallel but at a farther distance compared to others; due to its location in a different lanelet and relative position, it's not an immediate threat.

3. **Obstacle 30606**
   - Position: (-144.667, -113.8775)
   - Velocity: 13.8414
   - This obstacle is in a different lanelet and moving away from the Ego's trajectory.

4. **Obstacle 30613, 30614, 30628, 30629**
   - Position and velocity suggest minimal movement around a fixed point, not intersecting with the ego vehicle's trajectory.
   - They appear stationary or moving very slowly, indicating negligible risk.

5. **Obstacle 30610 and 30605**
   - Both obstacles have zero velocity and remain stationary, posing no immediate risk under current conditions.

### Detailed Analysis for Risky Obstacles

- **Obstacle 30629** is in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle (986.0) and, although it has a much lower velocity and negative acceleration, it is potentially approaching due to its position (-137.6781, -95.0427) and closing distance over previous time steps. It requires attention but given its lower velocity, the risk is manageable (Medium Risk).

- **Obstacle 30628** is also in lanelet 985.0. It poses a lower risk due to its relative position not intersecting with the ego's lanelet directly, decreasing velocity, and is situated behind the ego vehicle.

Both 30629 and 30628 require monitoring, but the chances of an imminent collision remain low based on the trajectories and positioning provided. None of the obstacles qualify for a risk level 0 or 1 under current data trends.

**NOTE:** The empty JSON objects indicate no obstacles match the criteria for extreme risk or collision under the given assessment.
