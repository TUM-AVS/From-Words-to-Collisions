Obstacle 30629 is in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle and is approaching from behind.  At t=3.1s, obstacle 30629 is approximately 0.06m behind the ego vehicle laterally and -0.01m longitudinally.  The relative longitudinal velocity suggests the obstacle is decelerating faster than the ego vehicle. Given the close proximity and closing speeds, there is a high risk of collision.
