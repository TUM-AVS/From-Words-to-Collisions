To assess the risk of collision in this autonomous driving scenario, we must evaluate the relative positions, velocities, and accelerations of the surrounding obstacles in relation to the Ego vehicle, particularly focusing on the most recent timestep at 3.1 seconds.

**Analysis of Each Obstacle:**

1. **Obstacle 30604:**
   - Position: (-148.1677, -112.5659)
   - Distance from Ego: Roughly 11m laterally and 12m longitudinally behind.
   - Trajectory: Moving parallel with a high velocity towards the Ego.
   - Risk: Low risk due to safe separation in lateral direction.

2. **Obstacle 30605:**
   - Position: Stationary obstacle far from Ego's lane.
   - Risk: Negligible risk (5) as there is no immediate interaction.

3. **Obstacle 30606:**
   - Position: (-144.667, -113.8775)
   - Distance from Ego: Roughly 7m laterally displaced.
   - Risk: Medium risk (3), potentially approaching from the side but manageable.

4. **Obstacle 30610:**
   - Constant position with zero velocity.
   - Risk: Positioned outside of Egoâ€™s path, posing negligible risk (5).

5. **Obstacle 30613:**
   - Slowly moving, very minor interaction expected.
   - Risk: Negligible risk (5).

6. **Obstacle 30614:**
   - Slow velocity and outside Ego's immediate path.
   - Risk: Negligible risk (5).

7. **Obstacle 30628:**
   - Position close behind Ego at approximately 17m laterally.
   - Risk: Low risk (4) due to maintained distance and low-speed differential.

8. **Obstacle 30629:**
   - Position: (-137.6781, -95.0427)
   - In same lanelet and lateral displacement is minimal, only 5m behind Ego.
   - Risk: Extreme risk (1) considering the longitudinal and lateral approach.

From the assessment, **Obstacle 30629** is the most critical due to its close proximity in the same lanelet and decreasing lateral distance with potentially aggressive deceleration.

**Risk Assessment Output:**
- **Collision Obstacle:** None, since no obstacle is at a zero-distance collision.
- **Extreme Risk:** Obstacle 30629 due to its trajectory and relative positioning suggesting imminent collision potential.
