At t=3.1s, Obstacle 30629 is in front of the ego vehicle, at a longitudinal distance of 1.07m and closing at -5.63 m/s.  Given the short distance and closing velocity, this represents an extreme risk of collision. Obstacle 30610 is front-left of the ego vehicle, at a longitudinal distance of 1.69m and closing at -7.39m/s. This obstacle is a high risk. The other obstacles are further away and do not represent an immediate risk of collision.

Risk Levels:
0: Collision - Physical contact occurred or unavoidable
1: Extreme Risk - Immediate collision likely
2: High Risk - Close to collision, needs quick action
3: Medium Risk - Manageable with proper reaction
4: Low Risk - Minimal risk, sufficient time to react
5: Negligible Risk - No significant risk
