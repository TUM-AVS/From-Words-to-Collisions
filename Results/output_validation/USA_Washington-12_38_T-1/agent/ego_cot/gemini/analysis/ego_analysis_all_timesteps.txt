### Safety analysis for timestep 3.1 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

**Assumptions and Clarifications:**

* Since the provided scenario lacks vehicle dimensions, I'm assuming standard car dimensions for illustrative purposes in calculating adjusted distances.  A standard car width of approximately 2 meters and length of 4.5 meters is assumed. Therefore, from the location (DTClong and DTClat), the adjusted distance is calculated roughly by:
    * `adjusted_d_long` = |DTClong| - 4.5/2 (half the ego car length)  If DTClong > 0, else |DTClong| + 4.5/2
    * `adjusted_d_lat` = |DTClat| - 2.0/2 (half the ego car width)   If DTClat > 0, else |DTClat| + 2.0/2

*  I will use the provided relative velocities and the adjusted distances to estimate TTC (Time to Collision).
     * TTClong = adjusted_d_long / Vrel_long.
     * TTClat = adjusted_d_lat / Vrel_lat.
* Since the given data does not include explicit TTC or MDC values, these will be estimated based on provided distances, relative velocities, and relative motion descriptions.
* No information on ego vehicle's intended trajectory is available, so calculations assume the ego vehicle maintains its current course and speed.



### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID:** 30604
- **Distance Risk reason:** Obstacle is in the Rear-left and moving away. `adjusted_d_long` ≈ 5.18m , `adjusted_d_lat` ≈ 6.43m.
- **Distance safety score:** 5
- **Time Risk reason:** Moving away from ego. TTC not applicable in this case.
- **Time safety score:** 5
- **Overall Risk score:** 5

- **Obstacle ID:** 30605
- **Distance Risk reason:** Obstacle is in the Front-left, but relatively far. `adjusted_d_long` ≈ 11.41m , `adjusted_d_lat` ≈ 12.66m.
- **Distance safety score:** 5
- **Time Risk reason:** TTClong ≈ 11.41m / -7.39m/s ≈ -1.54s. Negative TTC means the obstacle is moving towards the ego vehicle longitudinally, but the large distance gives ample time. TTClat is not relevant as per provided motion.
- **Time safety score:** 5
- **Overall Risk score:** 5

- **Obstacle ID:** 30606
- **Distance Risk reason:** Obstacle is in the Rear-left and moving away. `adjusted_d_long` ≈ 6.49m , `adjusted_d_lat` ≈ 7.74m.
- **Distance safety score:** 5
- **Time Risk reason:** Moving away from ego. TTC not applicable in this case.
- **Time safety score:** 5
- **Overall Risk score:** 5

- **Obstacle ID:** 30610
- **Distance Risk reason:** Obstacle is Front-left and close. `adjusted_d_long` ≈ -0.56m , `adjusted_d_lat` ≈ 0.69m.
- **Distance safety score:** 1
- **Time Risk reason:**  TTClong ≈ -0.56m / -7.39m/s ≈ 0.08s. TTClat is not relevant as per provided motion.
- **Time safety score:** 1
- **Overall Risk score:** 1

- **Obstacle ID:** 30613
- **Distance Risk reason:** Obstacle is Left and close. `adjusted_d_long` ≈ -2.25m , `adjusted_d_lat` ≈ -1m.
- **Distance safety score:** 1
- **Time Risk reason:**  TTClong ≈ -2.25m / -7.38m/s ≈ 0.31s. TTClat is not relevant as per provided motion.
- **Time safety score:** 1
- **Overall Risk score:** 1

- **Obstacle ID:** 30614
- **Distance Risk reason:** Obstacle is Rear-left and moving slightly away. `adjusted_d_long` ≈ 2.06m , `adjusted_d_lat` ≈ 3.31m.
- **Distance safety score:** 3
- **Time Risk reason:** Moving away from ego longitudinally but TTC is quite low. TTClong ≈ 2.06m / -7.37m/s ≈ -0.28s, hence it is moving towards the ego longitudinally. TTClat is not relevant as per provided motion.
- **Time safety score:** 2
- **Overall Risk score:** 2

- **Obstacle ID:** 30628
- **Distance Risk reason:** Obstacle is in the Rear-left and moving away. `adjusted_d_long` ≈ 11.07m , `adjusted_d_lat` ≈ 12.32m.
- **Distance safety score:** 5
- **Time Risk reason:** Moving away from ego. TTC not applicable in this case.
- **Time safety score:** 5
- **Overall Risk score:** 5

- **Obstacle ID:** 30629
- **Distance Risk reason:** Obstacle is in the Front and close. `adjusted_d_long` ≈ -1.18m , `adjusted_d_lat` ≈ 0.07m.
- **Distance safety score:** 1
- **Time Risk reason:** TTClong ≈ -1.18m / -5.63m/s ≈ 0.21s. TTClat is not relevant as per provided motion.
- **Time safety score:** 1
- **Overall Risk score:** 1
