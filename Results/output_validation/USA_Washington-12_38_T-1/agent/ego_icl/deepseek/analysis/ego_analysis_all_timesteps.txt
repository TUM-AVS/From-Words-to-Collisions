Let me analyze each obstacle at the most recent timestep (3.1 seconds) and assess collision risks:

1. **Obstacle 30604 (Rear-left)**
   - Adjusted distances: Longitudinal -7.43m, Lateral 9.03m
   - Relative velocities: Longitudinal -20.86m/s (moving away), Lateral 0.01m/s (negligible)
   - MDC: 9.03m (lateral distance)
   - TTC: N/A (moving away in both dimensions)
   - Risk: 5 (Negligible)

2. **Obstacle 30605 (Front-left)**
   - Adjusted distances: Longitudinal 13.66m, Lateral 17.66m
   - Relative velocities: Longitudinal -7.39m/s (approaching), Lateral -0.00m/s
   - MDC: 13.66m (longitudinal distance)
   - TTC: 13.66/7.39 = 1.85s
   - Risk: 3 (Medium)

3. **Obstacle 30606 (Rear-left)**
   - Adjusted distances: Longitudinal -8.74m, Lateral 5.53m
   - Relative velocities: Longitudinal -21.23m/s (moving away), Lateral 0.01m/s
   - MDC: 5.53m (lateral distance)
   - TTC: N/A (moving away)
   - Risk: 5 (Negligible)

4. **Obstacle 30610 (Front-left)**
   - Adjusted distances: Longitudinal 1.69m, Lateral 2.02m
   - Relative velocities: Longitudinal -7.39m/s (approaching), Lateral -0.00m/s
   - MDC: 1.69m (longitudinal distance)
   - TTC: 1.69/7.39 = 0.23s
   - Risk: 1 (Extreme Risk)

5. **Obstacle 30613 (Left)**
   - Adjusted distances: Longitudinal 0.00m, Lateral 2.03m
   - Relative velocities: Longitudinal -7.38m/s, Lateral -0.00m/s
   - MDC: 2.03m (lateral distance)
   - TTC: N/A (no closing velocity)
   - Risk: 3 (Medium)

6. **Obstacle 30614 (Rear-left)**
   - Adjusted distances: Longitudinal -4.31m, Lateral 2.03m
   - Relative velocities: Longitudinal -7.37m/s, Lateral -0.00m/s
   - MDC: 2.03m (lateral distance)
   - TTC: N/A (moving away longitudinally)
   - Risk: 3 (Medium)

7. **Obstacle 30628 (Rear-left)**
   - Adjusted distances: Longitudinal -13.32m, Lateral 2.04m
   - Relative velocities: Longitudinal -5.97m/s, Lateral -0.00m/s
   - MDC: 2.04m (lateral distance)
   - TTC: N/A (moving away)
   - Risk: 3 (Medium)

8. **Obstacle 30629 (Front)**
   - Adjusted distances: Longitudinal 1.07m, Lateral 0.00m
   - Relative velocities: Longitudinal -5.63m/s, Lateral -0.00m/s
   - MDC: 1.07m (longitudinal distance)
   - TTC: 1.07/5.63 = 0.19s
   - Risk: 1 (Extreme Risk)

**Trajectory Analysis:**
- Obstacle 30610 shows rapid longitudinal closing (from 2.55m to 1.69m in 0.1s)
- Obstacle 30629 shows consistent longitudinal closing (from 1.73m to 1.07m in 0.1s)
- Both are on direct collision courses with extremely low TTC values

**Predicted Collision:**
Obstacle 30629 is most critical as it's directly ahead (lateral 0.00m) with extremely low TTC (0.19s)
