At t=3.1s:

* **Obstacle 30604 (Rear-Left):**  This obstacle is moving away longitudinally (-7.43m) and laterally (9.03m). It poses no risk. Risk Level: 5 (Negligible Risk)

* **Obstacle 30605 (Front-Left):** This obstacle is relatively far at 13.66m longitudinally and 17.66m laterally.  While it's approaching longitudinally (-7.39 m/s), the lateral distance is significant. With no lateral relative velocity, the risk is currently low.  Risk Level: 4 (Low Risk)

* **Obstacle 30606 (Rear-Left):** Similar to 30604, this obstacle is moving away both longitudinally (-8.74m) and laterally (5.53m).  Risk Level: 5 (Negligible Risk)

* **Obstacle 30610 (Front-Left):** This obstacle is at 1.69m longitudinally and 2.02m laterally, and approaching longitudinally (-7.39 m/s).  This represents a medium risk due to proximity.
    * TTC (longitudinal) = 1.69m / 7.39m/s ≈ 0.23 seconds
    * Risk Level: 2 (High Risk) because of the small distance combined with the high closing velocity (TTC < 1). The fact that the lateral component of its velocity is zero means there is a high chance of it hitting the car from the front and left (and it could also swing back toward the ego car) .

* **Obstacle 30613 (Left):**  This obstacle is at 0.00m longitudinally and 2.03m laterally. The zero longitudinal distance indicates alignment in that dimension, not necessarily a collision. The lateral distance suggests some separation.  However, with a negative longitudinal velocity (-7.38 m/s), it is moving away longitudinally from the ego vehicle's side. The lateral relative velocity being zero and the slight distance and motion away longitudinally means it is unlikely to hit the car. Risk Level: 4 (Low Risk)

* **Obstacle 30614 (Rear-Left):**  Moving away longitudinally (-4.31m) and has a safe lateral distance (2.03m). Risk Level: 5 (Negligible Risk)

* **Obstacle 30628 (Rear-Left):** Clearly moving away longitudinally (-13.32m) and has a safe lateral distance (2.04m). Risk Level: 5 (Negligible Risk)

* **Obstacle 30629 (Front):** This obstacle is at 1.07m longitudinally and 0.00m laterally with longitudinal closing velocity. The zero lateral distance indicates it is in the same lane. This is a high risk situation.
    * TTC (longitudinal) = 1.07m / 5.63m/s ≈ 0.19s
    * Risk Level: 1 (Extreme Risk). The combination of very short distance, alignment in the lateral direction, and high closing velocity indicates an extremely high risk of collision.
