**Obstacle-by-Obstacle Analysis**

1. **Obstacle 30604**
   - Position: Rear-left with moved position more behind over time.
   - Adjusted Distances: Lateral 9.05 m, Longitudinal -8.95 m
   - Velocity: Longitudinal -20.86 m/s, Lateral 0.01 m/s
   - Description: Moving away, not a collision risk.
   - Calculated Risk: No TTC or MDC applicable as obstacle is moving away.

2. **Obstacle 30605**
   - Position: Front-left
   - Adjusted Distances: Lateral 17.66 m, Longitudinal 13.66 m
   - Velocity: Longitudinal -7.39 m/s, Lateral 0.00 m/s
   - Description: Approaching but not on a collision path.
   - Calculated Risk: TTC > 5 s, MDC > 5 m. Risk score: 5
   
3. **Obstacle 30606**
   - Position: Rear-left moving further back over time.
   - Adjusted Distances: Lat 5.54 m, Long -8.74 m
   - Velocity: Longitudinal -21.23 m/s, Lateral 0.01 m/s
   - Description: Moving away, reducing collision risk.
   - Calculated Risk: No TTC or MDC applicable as obstacle is moving away.

4. **Obstacle 30610**
   - Position: Front-left
   - Adjusted Distances: Lat 2.02 m, Long 1.69 m
   - Velocity: Longitudinal -7.39 m/s
   - Description: On approach with relatively close longitudinal distance.
   - TTC (Long): 0.229 s, approaching
   - MDC (Long): 1.69 m
   - Calculated Risk: Medium Risk as both TTC and MDC are close to medium risk limits. Risk score: 3

5. **Obstacle 30613**
   - Position: Left, aligned longitudinally
   - Adjusted Distances: Lat 2.03 m
   - Velocity: Longitudinal -7.38 m/s, Lateral 0.00 m/s
   - Description: Side-by-side alignment, moving away laterally.
   - Calculated Risk: Not applicable for TTC or MDC due to current movement

6. **Obstacle 30614**
   - Position: Rear-left moving away and laterally driving
   - Adjusted Distances: Lat 2.03 m, Long -4.31 m
   - Velocity: Longitudinal -7.37 m/s, Lateral 0.00 m/s
   - Description: Moving proportionally so no current escalation in risk.
   - Calculated Risk: Not applicable for TTC or MDC due to current movement

7. **Obstacle 30628**
   - Position: Rear-left moving away over time.
   - Adjusted Distances: Lat 2.04 m, Long -13.32 m
   - Velocity: Longitudinal -5.97 m/s, Lateral 0.00 m/s
   - Description: Continues moving away.
   - Calculated Risk: No notable collision risk due to direction

8. **Obstacle 30629**
   - Position: Front, direct longitudinal alignment
   - Adjusted Distances: Long 1.07 m
   - Velocity: Longitudinal -5.63 m/s
   - Description: On a clear collision path, converging
   - TTC (Long): 0.19 s
   - MDC (Long): 1.07 m
   - Calculated Risk: Extreme risk, highest priority. Risk score: 1
