At t=3.3s, Ego is in lanelet 986 with a velocity of 5.85 m/s and decelerating at -3.13 m/s². Obstacle 30629 is also in lanelet 986, moving much slower at 0.89 m/s and decelerating rapidly at -4.36 m/s².  The positions of Ego and Obstacle 30629 are (-137.538, -99.1464) and (-137.6782, -94.7999) respectively.  Although Obstacle 30629 is ahead of Ego within the same lanelet, the large velocity difference and opposing accelerations suggest a likely collision in the next timestep.  Therefore, I assess Obstacle 30629 as an extreme risk (Risk Score 1). The other obstacles are sufficiently far from Ego's trajectory and therefore do not present an immediate risk.

  "ScenarioAnalysis": {
    "IsCollisionScenario": false,
    "Reasoning": "Obstacle 30629 poses an extreme risk of collision with Ego in the next timestep due to their close proximity within the same lanelet and significant velocity difference, despite both decelerating. Other obstacles are not an immediate threat."
