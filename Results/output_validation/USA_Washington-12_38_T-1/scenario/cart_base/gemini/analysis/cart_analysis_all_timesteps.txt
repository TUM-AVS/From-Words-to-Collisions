At t=3.3s, Ego (30630) is in lanelet 986 and decelerating. Obstacle 30629 is also in lanelet 986 and decelerating rapidly.  The y-coordinates are converging and only about 0.7 apart. Given the current velocities and decelerations, a collision or near miss in the next timestep is highly likely.

Obstacle 30614 in lanelet 985 is moving slowly and presents minimal risk.  Other obstacles are in different lanelets and appear to pose no immediate threat within the analyzed timeframe.
