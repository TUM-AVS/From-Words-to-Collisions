### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 30604.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is in a different lanelet and relatively far from the ego vehicle.  The historical trajectory shows it moving further away.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason:  The relative velocities and accelerations, along with the historical trend, indicate no time-based risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 30605.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is far away and in a different lanelet, posing no immediate risk. The history confirms this.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Obstacle is stationary and poses no time-related risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 30606.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is in a different lanelet and relatively far from the ego vehicle.  The historical trajectory shows it moving further away.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: The relative velocities and accelerations, along with the historical trend, indicate no time-based risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 30610.0
- Distance Risk reason:  Obstacle is far and in a different lane, posing no immediate spatial risk. The history confirms this.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Obstacle is stationary, posing no temporal risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 30613.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is in a different lane and relatively far from the ego vehicle.  The historical trajectory shows it to be essentially stationary.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: The obstacle is almost stationary and poses no time-related risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 30614.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is in a different lane and relatively far from the ego vehicle. The historical trajectory shows it to be essentially stationary.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: The obstacle has minimal velocity and poses no significant time-related risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 30628.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is in a different lane, and while closer laterally, poses no immediate risk given the separation. The history indicates some lateral movement but not towards the ego vehicle.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason:  The obstacle's low velocity and deceleration, combined with the historical trend, suggests a decreasing time-based risk.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- Obstacle ID: 30629.0
- Distance Risk reason: This obstacle is in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle but sufficiently far ahead. The history confirms its movement forward, away from the ego vehicle.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: The obstacle's velocity is higher than the ego vehicle's, and it's decelerating.  However, it is moving away from the ego vehicle.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4


### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. **Most critical obstacles:** Obstacles 30628.0 and 30629.0 are the closest and require the most attention as they share lanelets with the ego vehicle at some point in the provided timeframe.
2. **Trajectory Analysis:**  30629.0 is in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle but always ahead and moving further away over the 10 timesteps. 30628.0 is in an adjacent lane and maintains a safe lateral distance despite some minor fluctuations in its trajectory.
3. **Relative Positions, Velocities, and Accelerations:** The ego vehicle is decelerating while others, like 30604.0 and 30606.0, are accelerating, but in different lanelets. Obstacle 30629.0, initially faster than the ego, is also decelerating but remains ahead. 30628.0 is moving slowly and decelerating, maintaining a safe distance.
4. **Collision Determination:** No collision has occurred, and none appears imminent based on the provided data. All obstacles either maintain a safe distance or are moving away from the ego vehicle.
5. **Reasoning:** The analysis of trajectories, combined with the relative positions, velocities, and accelerations over the entire provided timeframe, shows no indication of a collision. The key factor is the consistent separation maintained by all obstacles, either laterally (different lanelets) or longitudinally.
