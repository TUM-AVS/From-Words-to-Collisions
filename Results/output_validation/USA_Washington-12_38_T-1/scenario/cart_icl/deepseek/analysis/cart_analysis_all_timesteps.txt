### Safety Analysis for the Most Recent Timestep (3.3 seconds):

### Obstacle Analysis:

1. **Obstacle ID: 30604**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Moving parallel to ego in adjacent lane (lanelet 983 vs 986), maintaining ~10m lateral distance.
   - **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: Similar velocity (13.79m/s vs ego's 5.85m/s) but diverging paths.
   - **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 4

2. **Obstacle ID: 30606**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: In adjacent lane (984) moving parallel with ~8m lateral distance.
   - **Distance safety score**: 4
   - **Time Risk reason**: Higher velocity (14.23m/s) but no convergence.
   - **Time safety score**: 4
   - **Overall Risk score**: 4

3. **Obstacle ID: 30607**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: In lanelet 8, moving away from ego (-167.13,-78.93) vs (-137.54,-99.15).
   - **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible)
   - **Time Risk reason**: Moving away at 10.95m/s.
   - **Time safety score**: 5
   - **Overall Risk score**: 5

4. **Obstacle ID: 30629**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: In same lanelet (986) as ego, closest obstacle at (-137.68,-94.80) vs ego (-137.54,-99.15).
   - **Distance safety score**: 2 (High Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: Decelerating rapidly (v=0.89m/s, a=-4.36m/s²), moving toward ego's path.
   - **Time safety score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 1

(Other obstacles are either stationary or moving away with no convergence - all scored 4 or 5)

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. Ego is decelerating heavily (a=-3.13m/s²) to 5.85m/s
2. Only Obstacle 30629 is in the same lanelet and moving toward ego's path
3. TTC calculation: Distance ~4.35m / (5.85m/s + 0.89m/s) ≈ 0.65s (critical)
4. No actual collision at this timestep, but extreme risk exists
5. All other obstacles are either stationary or on non-intersecting paths
