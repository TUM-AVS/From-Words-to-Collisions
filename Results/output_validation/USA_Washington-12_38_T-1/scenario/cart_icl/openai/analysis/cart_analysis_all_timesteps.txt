### Obstacle Analysis:

#### Obstacle 30604:
- **Distance Risk Reason**: The obstacle is consistently maintaining a distance behind the ego vehicle and is traveling in a parallel lane with their path not converging with the ego.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 4
- **Time Risk Reason**: The obstacle has been accelerating, indicating it is moving away from the ego or maintaining a safe distance.
- **Time Safety Score**: 5
- **Overall Risk Score**: 4

#### Obstacle 30605:
- **Distance Risk Reason**: Stationary throughout the observation period, placed in a distant lane which does not intersect with the ego's.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 5
- **Time Risk Reason**: No movement or acceleration detected.
- **Time Safety Score**: 5
- **Overall Risk Score**: 5

#### Obstacle 30606:
- **Distance Risk Reason**: The obstacle maintains a path in a different lane, gradually moving away from the ego's trajectory.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 4
- **Time Risk Reason**: The obstacle is accelerating but is consistently within its lane and maintaining a parallel trajectory without converging towards the ego.
- **Time Safety Score**: 5
- **Overall Risk Score**: 4

#### Obstacle 30610:
- **Distance Risk Reason**: Stationary throughout, located significantly upfront within a lane that lies outside the ego's path.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 5
- **Time Risk Reason**: As it does not move or change with respect to the ego, there is no time risk.
- **Time Safety Score**: 5
- **Overall Risk Score**: 5

#### Obstacle 30613:
- **Distance Risk Reason**: Slow movement situated in a lane separate from the ego's non-converging trajectory.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 5
- **Time Risk Reason**: Its negligible velocity and acceleration indicate no significant interaction risk.
- **Time Safety Score**: 5
- **Overall Risk Score**: 5

#### Obstacle 30614:
- **Distance Risk Reason**: Slow movement in a stationary lane relative to ego's movement, showing no intersecting trajectory.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 5
- **Time Risk Reason**: Minimal movement suggests no immediate risk with the ego vehicle.
- **Time Safety Score**: 5
- **Overall Risk Score**: 5

#### Obstacle 30628:
- **Distance Risk Reason**: Positioned within a lane slightly offset but removal acceleration indicates minimal risk intersecting with the ego's path.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 4
- **Time Risk Reason**: It's gradually reducing speed and its path does not intersect the ego vehicle.
- **Time Safety Score**: 5
- **Overall Risk Score**: 4

#### Obstacle 30629:
- **Distance Risk Reason**: This obstacle is in the same lanelet as the ego, with paths closely aligned, but it's decelerating.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 3
- **Time Risk Reason**: Although deceleration continues, careful monitoring is required, considering the proximity within the same lane.
- **Time Safety Score**: 4
- **Overall Risk Score**: 3

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
The evaluation of the obstacles reveals that none have a trajectory directly leading to collision with the ego. There is steady deceleration by obstacles in adjacent lanes or same-lanelet travel, reducing imminent risk and avoiding immediate collision. Overall traffic dynamics show temporary threats mitigated by maneuvers, thus not deeming this a collision scenario.
