Here's the collision risk analysis:

**Analysis:**

The ego vehicle (ID 30572) is moving forward and decelerating within lanelet 302.  Several obstacles are present, some stationary and some moving. Let's analyze the risk posed by each based on their trajectories and proximity to the ego vehicle across all provided timestamps.

* **Obstacle 30556:** Stationary and far from the ego vehicle's trajectory. Negligible Risk (5).
* **Obstacle 30560:** Stationary and far from the ego vehicle's trajectory. Negligible Risk (5).
* **Obstacle 30561:** Initially moving slowly in lanelet 303, but decelerating and poses no immediate threat. Medium risk (3) due to proximity but the differing trajectories and deceleration suggest sufficient time to react.
* **Obstacle 30563:** Stationary and far from the ego vehicle's trajectory. Negligible Risk (5).
* **Obstacle 30564:** Stationary and far from the ego vehicle's trajectory. Negligible Risk (5).
* **Obstacle 30568:** Moving in lanelet 301 and decelerating.  It is spatially separated from the ego vehicle and poses no immediate threat.  Low Risk (4).
* **Obstacle 30570:**  Located in the same lanelet (302) as the ego vehicle and moving slower than ego with a small, but consistent relative velocity between them. The distance between them appears stable or maybe even slightly decreasing. This obstacle represents a High Risk (2) and requires attention/monitoring.  Braking by Ego vehicle is already evident.
* **Obstacle 30571:**  Moving in lanelet 303 and decelerating. The separation is significant and the trajectories diverge. Medium Risk (3).
* **Obstacle 30574:**  Moving slowly but does not pose a risk due to the separation distance and distinct trajectories. Low Risk (4) due to general proximity.
* **Obstacle 30555:** Appears at 3.6 seconds and is far from the ego vehicle's trajectory. Negligible risk (5).
