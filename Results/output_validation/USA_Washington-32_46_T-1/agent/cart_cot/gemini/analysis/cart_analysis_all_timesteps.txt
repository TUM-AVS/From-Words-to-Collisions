Obstacle 30570 shows a concerning trend.  While not an immediate collision, its location in the same lane as the ego vehicle, coupled with the ego's deceleration and obstacle 30570's continued, albeit decreasing, velocity suggests a high risk of collision in the near future if the trend continues.  Obstacle 30571 is also in the same lane as the ego vehicle, but further away and also decelerating, thus posing medium risk.
