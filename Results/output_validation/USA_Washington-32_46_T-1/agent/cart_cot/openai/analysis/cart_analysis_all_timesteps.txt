### Analysis

In the scenario observed at 3.9 seconds, the following analysis focuses on the ego vehicle and its relation to the nearby obstacles:

1. **Obstacle 30570.0**:
    - **Position and proximity**: At 3.9 seconds, this obstacle is located at (-335.0527, 342.9139), which places it within the ego vehicle's lane and fairly close to its path.
    - **Relative motion**: It is moving with a slightly lower velocity than the ego vehicle, making it a candidate for a rear-end scenario.
    - **Risk assessment**: Given the proximity and the lane overlap with the ego vehicle, it poses a high risk for a close encounter or a potential collision if no action is taken.

2. **Obstacle 30571.0**:
    - **Position and proximity**: Situated at (-331.5127, 333.2846), this obstacle is nearly in the same east-west coordinate line as the ego and slightly southward vertically.
    - **Relative motion**: Moving with a velocity close to that of the ego's velocity but with a decrease over time.
    - **Risk assessment**: Despite being in a neighboring lanelet, its trajectory suggests a moderate risk due to spatial proximity and trajectory alignment, albeit not enough to categorize as imminent collision.

**JSON Output**:
