Obstacle 30570 is in the same lane as the ego vehicle and its distance is decreasing across time steps. At t=3.9s, the longitudinal distance is approximately 2.7 meters and the lateral distance is negligible.  Ego's velocity is decreasing but still greater than obstacle 30570's velocity. This implies a possible collision soon.

Obstacle 30571 is also in the path of the ego vehicle. The longitudinal distance is decreasing across time steps with a relatively high closing velocity, despite the ego's deceleration. At t=3.9s, the longitudinal distance is approximately 3.5 meters and the lateral distance is approximately 4.5 meters. Because the ego vehicle is decelerating rapidly, the risk of collision increases.
