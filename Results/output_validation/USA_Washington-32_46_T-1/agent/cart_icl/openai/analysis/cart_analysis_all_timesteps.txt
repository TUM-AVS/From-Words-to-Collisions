### Risk Assessment Analysis

To analyze the risk level of each obstacle, we consider the relative position, motion trajectory, velocity, orientation, lanelet positions, and their interaction with the ego vehicle over the past few timesteps.

Summary of each obstacle's time to collision (TTC) and potential risk at the last timestep (3.9 seconds):

1. **Obstacle 30556.0, Position: (-331.6121, 352.009)**
   - It remains stationary (v=0) and located far from Ego in a different lanelet.
   - No immediate or foreseeable collision risk.
   - **Risk: Negligible (5)**

2. **Obstacle 30560.0, Position: (-335.1183, 352.7512)**
   - Stationary and far from the Ego vehicle.
   - **Risk: Negligible (5)**

3. **Obstacle 30561.0, Position: (-331.5963, 344.067)**
   - Slow movement, reducing speed further.
   - Located in lanelet 303, which is separate from Ego's path.
   - Ego is decelerating and maintaining distance.
   - **Risk: Low (4)**

4. **Obstacle 30563.0, Position: (-338.6116, 351.859)**
   - Stationary, positioned remotely from Ego.
   - **Risk: Negligible (5)**

5. **Obstacle 30564.0, Position: (-342.1114, 351.779)**
   - Completely stationary, well away from Ego.
   - **Risk: Negligible (5)**

6. **Obstacle 30568.0, Position: (-338.5529, 342.9589)**
   - Moving at a low speed away from the Ego path.
   - **Risk: Low (4)**

7. **Obstacle 30570.0, Position: (-335.0527, 342.9139)**
   - Shares the same lanelet with Ego.
   - Relative velocity: Ego is decreasing speed significantly; however, given very minimal differential in position, the path could cross, notably drawing very close.
   - **TTC calculation**: Lack of substantial additional evidence of extreme urgent crossing in 0.1s, could consider higher if another sudden movement by ego (consider "High (2)"). 
     - **Activity: Continuing collision assessment mandatory if ego fails to take preventive steps imminently.**

8. **Obstacle 30571.0, Position: (-331.5127, 333.2846)**
   - Decreasing speed.
   - Despite being in a different lanelet, it's moving with minimal approach risk.
   - **Risk: Low (4)**

9. **Obstacle 30574.0, Position: (-342.0603, 344.1955)**
   - Became slowly mobile, but extensively far from direct ego interaction.
   - **Risk: Negligible (5)**

### Analysis Summary:
Considering all available data with a priority on safety in motion, none of the obstacles reach an Extreme or Collision-level risk. I have identified Obstacle ID `30570` for high-risk focus due to its position and speed nearing the Ego's trajectory significantly.

### JSON:

```json
{
    "CollisionObstacles": [],
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null,
    "HighRiskObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "30570",
        "OverallRiskScore": 2
    }
}
```

This output identifies the necessity for monitoring and active response strategies to handle the possible upcoming high-risk engagement from Obstacle 30570, albeit current evaluation confirms managed response capacity by existing Ego capabilities.
