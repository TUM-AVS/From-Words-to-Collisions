At timestamp 3.9 seconds, Obstacle 30570 is closest to the ego vehicle, with a longitudinal distance of 0.65m and approaching at -3.54 m/s.  Given its proximity and closing speed, this represents a high risk of collision. Obstacle 30568 is also very close at 0.71m longitudinally, but slightly offset laterally (1.89m) and traveling slower (-4.32 m/s). Although close, the lateral offset and speed make it less of an immediate threat than 30570. Obstacle 30561 is also close at 1.79m longitudinally and also laterally offset (-1.85m). Other obstacles are farther away and pose less immediate risk.
