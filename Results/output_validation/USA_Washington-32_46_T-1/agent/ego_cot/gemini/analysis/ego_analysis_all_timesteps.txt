### Safety analysis for timestep 3.9 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

**Assumptions and Clarifications:**

* Since the provided scenario lacks ego vehicle dimensions and adjusted distances (adjusted_d_long, adjusted_d_lat), I'll perform the analysis using the given real distances (DTClong, DTClat) as a proxy.  However, it's crucial to understand that this is a less accurate assessment and a proper evaluation requires adjusted distances. It is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED to include ego vehicle size and calculate and include ADJUSTED DISTANCES in your future scenario descriptions. Also include ego vehicle speed.

* I will assume a rectangular shape for the ego vehicle and obstacles for simplification.  More complex shapes require more sophisticated distance calculations.

* When lateral distance is zero and the obstacle is to the right or left, I will assume a potential sideswipe collision is possible.  This assumes the ego vehicle and obstacle have overlapping longitudinal positions.

* I am calculating TTC using distance/relative_velocity. This assumes constant velocity. More accurate TTC calculations should consider acceleration as well.
