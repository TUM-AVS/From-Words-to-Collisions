Let me analyze the obstacles at the most recent timestep (3.9 seconds) with trajectory context from previous timesteps:

1. Obstacle 30555 (Front-right):
   - Longitudinal: 20.10m (adjusted), closing at 5.62 m/s → TTC = 3.58s
   - Lateral: -10.55m (stable)
   - Risk: Medium (3) - closing but still far enough

2. Obstacle 30556 (Front-right):
   - Longitudinal: 9.73m, closing at 5.62 m/s → TTC = 1.73s
   - Lateral: -1.87m (stable)
   - Risk: Medium (3)

3. Obstacle 30560 (Front):
   - Longitudinal: 10.49m, closing at 5.62 m/s → TTC = 1.87s
   - Lateral: 0.00m (exact alignment)
   - Risk: Medium (3) - same lane but sufficient distance

4. Obstacle 30561 (Front-right):
   - Longitudinal: 1.79m, closing at 5.18 m/s → TTC = 0.35s (Extreme Risk)
   - Lateral: -1.85m, closing at 0.00 m/s (but trajectory shows lateral approach)
   - MDC: 1.85m (High Risk)
   - Risk: Extreme (1) - very close with imminent collision risk

5. Obstacle 30563 (Front-left):
   - Longitudinal: 9.61m, closing at 5.62 m/s → TTC = 1.71s
   - Lateral: 1.91m (stable)
   - Risk: Medium (3)

6. Obstacle 30564 (Front-left):
   - Longitudinal: 9.54m, closing at 5.62 m/s → TTC = 1.70s
   - Lateral: 5.41m (stable)
   - Risk: Medium (3)

7. Obstacle 30568 (Front-left):
   - Longitudinal: 0.71m, closing at 4.32 m/s → TTC = 0.16s (Collision)
   - Lateral: 1.89m, moving away
   - MDC: 1.89m (but longitudinal collision imminent)
   - Risk: Collision (0) - will hit within next timestep

8. Obstacle 30570 (Front):
   - Longitudinal: 0.65m, closing at 3.54 m/s → TTC = 0.18s (Collision)
   - Lateral: 0.00m (exact alignment)
   - Risk: Collision (0) - direct frontal impact imminent

9. Obstacle 30571 (Right):
   - Longitudinal: 0.00m (aligned)
   - Lateral: -1.89m (moving away)
   - Risk: Negligible (5)

10. Obstacle 30574 (Front-left):
    - Longitudinal: 1.96m, closing at 5.53 m/s → TTC = 0.35s (Extreme Risk)
    - Lateral: 5.39m (moving away)
    - Risk: Extreme (1)

Most Critical Findings:
- Obstacles 30568 and 30570 are in imminent collision state (TTC < 0.2s)
- Obstacles 30561 and 30574 show extreme risk (TTC < 0.5s)
- Obstacle 30570 is particularly dangerous as it's directly ahead with exact alignment
