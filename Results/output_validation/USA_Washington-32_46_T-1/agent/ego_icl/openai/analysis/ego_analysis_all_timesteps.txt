Let's perform the risk analysis step-by-step for each obstacle at the most recent timestep (3.9 seconds), focusing on calculating the Time-to-Collision (TTC) and Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC):

1. **Obstacle 30555:**
   - **Longitudinal Distance:** 20.10 m
   - **Lateral Distance:** -10.55 m
   - **Relative Longitudinal Velocity:** -5.62 m/s
   - **TTC Longitudinal:** 20.10 m / 5.62 m/s = 3.58 s
   - **Risk Score for Longitudinal Direction:** Categorized as Low Risk (4), as TTC is between 3.0 and 5.0 seconds and MDC > 5.0 meters.
   - **Overall Risk:** Low Risk (4) primarily due to the significant longitudinal distance and negative velocity indicating moving away.

2. **Obstacle 30556:**
   - **Longitudinal Distance:** 9.73 m
   - **Lateral Distance:** -1.87 m
   - **Relative Longitudinal Velocity:** -5.62 m/s
   - **TTC Longitudinal:** 9.73 m / 5.62 m/s = 1.73 s
   - **Risk Score for Longitudinal Direction:** Categorized as Medium Risk (3), as TTC is between 1.0 and 3.0 seconds.
   - **Min Distance to Ego:** Longitudinal is the critical factor here as lateral is considerably apart.
   - **Overall Risk:** Medium Risk (3) due to converging path and MDC indicating medium range.

3. **Obstacle 30560:**
   - **Longitudinal Distance:** 10.49 m
   - **Lateral Distance:** 0.00 m
   - **Relative Longitudinal Velocity:** -5.62 m/s
   - **TTC Longitudinal:** 10.49 m / 5.62 m/s = 1.87 s
   - **Risk Score for Longitudinal Direction:** Medium Risk (3), with TTC between 1.0 and 3.0 seconds.
   - **Overall Risk:** Medium Risk (3) due to aligned path and converging velocity.

4. **Obstacle 30561:**
   - **Longitudinal Distance:** 1.79 m
   - **Lateral Distance:** -1.85 m
   - **Relative Longitudinal Velocity:** -5.18 m/s
   - **TTC Longitudinal:** 1.79 m / 5.18 m/s = 0.35 s
   - **Risk Score for Longitudinal Direction:** Extreme Risk (1) due to TTC < 0.5 s and both dimensions are reducing.
   - **Overall Risk:** Extreme Risk (1) due to approaching trajectory with close proximity in both dimensions.

5. **Obstacle 30563:**
   - **Longitudinal Distance:** 9.61 m
   - **Lateral Distance:** 1.91 m
   - **Relative Longitudinal Velocity:** -5.62 m/s
   - **TTC Longitudinal:** 9.61 m / 5.62 m/s = 1.71 s
   - **Risk Score for Longitudinal Direction:** Medium Risk (3) due to TTC between 1.0 and 3.0 seconds.
   - **Overall Risk:** Medium Risk (3) with adequate space suggesting no immediate collision.

6. **Obstacle 30564:**
   - **Longitudinal Distance:** 9.54 m
   - **Lateral Distance:** 5.41 m
   - **Relative Longitudinal Velocity:** -5.62 m/s
   - **TTC Longitudinal:** 9.54 m / 5.62 m/s = 1.70 s
   - **Risk Score for Longitudinal Direction:** Medium Risk (3) given the moderate closing speed.
   - **Overall Risk:** Medium Risk (3) since lateral space is ample enough to avoid immediate collision.

7. **Obstacle 30568:**
   - **Longitudinal Distance:** 0.71 m
   - **Lateral Distance:** 1.89 m
   - **Relative Longitudinal Velocity:** -4.32 m/s
   - **TTC Longitudinal:** 0.71 m / 4.32 m/s = 0.16 s
   - **Risk Score for Longitudinal Direction:** Collision Risk (0) due to extremely short distance coupled with low TTC.
   - **Overall Risk:** Collision Risk (0) due to imminent contact in longitudinal direction.

8. **Obstacle 30570:**
   - **Longitudinal Distance:** 0.65 m
   - **Lateral Distance:** 0.00 m
   - **Relative Longitudinal Velocity:** -3.54 m/s
   - **TTC Longitudinal:** 0.65 m / 3.54 m/s = 0.18 s
   - **Risk Score for Longitudinal Direction:** Collision Risk (0).
   - **Overall Risk:** Collision Risk (0) as both longitudinal and lateral alignments are extremely close.
 
9. **Obstacle 30571:**
   - **Longitudinal Distance:** 0.00 m
   - **Lateral Distance:** -1.89 m
   - **Relative Longitudinal Velocity:** -2.98 m/s
   - **TTC Longitudinal:** 0 (side alignment, no longitudinal distance)
   - **Overall Risk:** No Risk (5) as it is moving away laterally with no collision course.

10. **Obstacle 30574:**
    - **Longitudinal Distance:** 1.96 m
    - **Lateral Distance:** 5.39 m
    - **Relative Longitudinal Velocity:** -5.53 m/s
    - **TTC Longitudinal:** 1.96 m / 5.53 m/s = 0.35 s
    - **Risk Score for Longitudinal Direction:** Extreme Risk (1).
    - **Overall Risk:** Extreme Risk (1) given the fast-approaching position in the longitudinal direction albeit with lateral clearance.

**Conclusion:**
Based on the analysis, the following obstacles have the highest risk scores:

- **Collision Obstacle** (Risk Score 0): Obstacle ID 30568 and 30570 are on collision course.
- **Extreme Risk Obstacle** (Risk Score 1): Obstacle ID 30561 due to minimal time to potential collision.
- **High Risk Obstacle** (Risk Score 2): No other obstacles strictly fall into this category at current assessment.

{
    "CollisionObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "30568",
        "OverallRiskScore": "0"
    },
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "30561",
        "OverallRiskScore": "1"
    },
    "HighRiskObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "None",
        "OverallRiskScore": "2"
    }
}
```

(Note: In actual implementations, both collision obstacles can be listed, but priority for the most imminent is given to 30568 for demonstration purposes.)
