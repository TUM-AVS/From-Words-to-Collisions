At t=4.1s, the ego vehicle at (-335.0378, 338.8777) in lanelet 302 is assessed for collision risks.  Obstacle 30570 is also in lanelet 302 at (-335.0546, 343.2959), posing the most significant risk. Though obstacle 30570's velocity is decreasing, its position is directly ahead of the ego vehicle and within a close proximity, suggesting a high probability of collision in the immediate future given the ego vehicle's current velocity and deceleration. Other obstacles are not in the same lanelet and are far enough away to not pose an immediate threat.
