At t=4.1s, Ego is in lanelet 302 and decelerating.

* **Obstacle 30570:** This obstacle is also in lanelet 302, directly ahead of Ego, and also decelerating, but it's still closing in on the Ego vehicle. Given their current positions, velocities, and accelerations, there is a high risk of collision if both vehicles maintain their current trajectories. Risk score 2.

* **Obstacle 30571:**  This obstacle is in lanelet 303, adjacent to Ego. While not immediately likely to collide, the close proximity and Ego's deceleration warrant attention.  The risk appears to be medium (3) given a small lateral separation.

Other obstacles are stationary or moving away/in different directions, posing negligible collision risks.  No obstacles present a collision or extreme risk (scores 0 or 1).
