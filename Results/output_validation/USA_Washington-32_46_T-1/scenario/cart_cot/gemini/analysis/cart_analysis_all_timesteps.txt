- Obstacle ID: 30570.0
- Distance Risk reason: This obstacle is in the same lane as the ego vehicle, but sufficiently far ahead. Its trajectory shows it's slowing down.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: The obstacle is slowing down, and while in the same lane, it's far enough ahead that a collision is unlikely.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- Obstacle ID: 30571.0
- Distance Risk reason: This obstacle is in a different lane, and its trajectory suggests it will continue to move away from the ego vehicle.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: This obstacle is moving away from the ego vehicle.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- Obstacle ID: 30574.0
- Distance Risk reason: This obstacle is far and in a different lane. Its slow speed and trajectory suggest no immediate risk.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: The obstacle is very slow.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5


### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. **Most critical obstacles:** Obstacle 30570 is the most critical as it is in the same lane as the ego vehicle. Other obstacles are in different lanes or far enough away to pose minimal risk.
2. **Trajectory Analysis (10 timesteps):** Over the past 10 timesteps, the ego vehicle is decelerating. Obstacle 30570 is also decelerating and is ahead of the ego vehicle. The other obstacles maintain their lanes and exhibit minimal change in their trajectories. 
3. **Relative Positions, Velocities, and Accelerations:** The ego vehicle is behind 30570, both moving in the same direction. Both are decelerating, but no immediate collision is detected based on the provided data.  The other obstacles have clear lateral separation from the ego vehicle.
4. **Collision Determination:** No collision has occurred or is imminent within the given timeframe based on the provided data.
5. **Reasoning:** Although the ego vehicle and obstacle 30570 are in the same lane, the distance between them and their deceleration patterns suggest that a collision is not likely in the immediate future within the analyzed timeframe.  All other obstacles remain in different lanes and maintain safe distances.

  "ScenarioAnalysis": {
    "IsCollisionScenario": false,
    "Reasoning": "No collision is detected or predicted within the provided timeframe. While obstacle 30570 is in the same lane as the ego vehicle, the relative distance and the deceleration of both vehicles suggest no imminent collision.  All other obstacles are in different lanes or far enough away to pose no significant risk."
