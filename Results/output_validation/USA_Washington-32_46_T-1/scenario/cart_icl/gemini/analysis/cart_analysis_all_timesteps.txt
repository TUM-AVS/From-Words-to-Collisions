### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
No obstacle poses an immediate collision risk.  All obstacles are either stationary, slowing down, or in different lanelets. Although obstacle 30570 is in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle, both are decelerating, and the distance between them is increasing, suggesting reduced risk over time. Therefore, this is not a collision scenario.

### Summary in JSON Format:

  "CollisionObstacles": [],
  "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null,
  "ScenarioAnalysis": {
    "IsCollisionScenario": false,
    "Reasoning": "No obstacle poses an immediate collision risk. All obstacles are either stationary, slowing down, or in different lanelets.  Obstacle 30570, while in the same lane, is maintaining a safe distance and decelerating along with the ego vehicle."
