   - **Time Risk reason**: Accelerating slightly negative, extending time to collision scenario.
   - **Time safety score**: 4
   - **Overall Risk score**: 4

10. **Obstacle ID: 30574.0** 
    - **Distance Risk reason**: Remote with minimal velocity in an unthreatening direction.
    - **Distance safety score**: 5
    - **Time Risk reason**: Static nature suggests no time-based threat.
    - **Time safety score**: 5
    - **Overall Risk score**: 5

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
Based on the evaluation, there is no collision or extreme risk present at the 4.1 seconds timeframe. All obstacles are either static or on safe trajectories relative to the ego vehicle's path. The slow convergence of some obstacles towards shared lanelets (30570.0) presents moderate risk, but not immediate danger.
