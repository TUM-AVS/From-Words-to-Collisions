Obstacle 30561 is at a longitudinal distance of 0.75 meters and a lateral distance of -1.85 meters, placing it very close to the ego vehicle in the front-right zone.  It has a closing longitudinal velocity (-3.89 m/s) with a small lateral velocity component. This represents a very high risk of collision.

Obstacle 30568 is now to the left of the ego vehicle but is still close with a lateral distance of 1.89 meters, though the longitudinal distance is 0 meters, the negative relative longitudinal velocity indicates it is moving away longitudinally. This warrants attention but is less immediately concerning compared to 30561.

Obstacle 30570 shows a longitudinal distance of 0.0 meters and a lateral distance of 0.0 meters. It is in the direct path of the ego vehicle and poses an immediate collision risk. The relative longitudinal velocity indicates a closing speed, further confirming the critical nature of this obstacle.

Obstacle 30574 is at a longitudinal distance of 0.86 meters and a lateral distance of 5.39 meters relative to the ego vehicle.  Its longitudinal velocity suggests it's moving closer to the ego vehicle. Although it's somewhat further away laterally, the closing longitudinal distance and speed raise concern.
