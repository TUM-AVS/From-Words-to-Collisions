At t=4.1s, Obstacle 30570 is in the "Collision" state with the ego vehicle, indicating a collision has occurred or is unavoidable in the next timestep. The longitudinal and lateral distances are both 0.0m, and the relative longitudinal velocity is -2.45 m/s. Obstacle 30561 is at high risk due to its close proximity (0.75m longitudinal, -1.85m lateral) and is approaching the ego car longitudinally at -3.89 m/s. Obstacle 30574 also presents a high risk (0.86m longitudinal, 5.39m lateral), approaching longitudinally at -4.19 m/s. Other obstacles are further away and pose less immediate risk.

**Risk Levels and Definitions:**
<Collision (Score: 0)>: Actual collision has occurred or is unavoidable within the next timestep.
<Extreme Risk (Score: 1)>: Immediate collision or very high likelihood of impact. Urgent action is required.
<High Risk (Score: 2)>: Close to collision or highly probable collision path. Needs prompt attention and quick manoeuvring.
<Medium Risk (Score: 3)>: Moderate collision risk but manageable with timely reactions and proper strategies.
<Low Risk (Score: 4)>: Minimal collision risk. The situation is controllable with sufficient time to react.
<Negligible Risk (Score: 5)>: No significant collision risk. Obstacles are either moving away or far enough not to interfere.
