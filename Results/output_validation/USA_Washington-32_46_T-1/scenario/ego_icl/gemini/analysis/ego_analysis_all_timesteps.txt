* **Obstacle 30555:** Front-right, longitudinal 18.98m, lateral -10.55m.  This obstacle is relatively far and poses no immediate risk. The lateral distance is negative, indicating it's to the right of the ego vehicle.  Trajectory analysis shows it is approaching longitudinally but not significantly laterally. Risk: No Risk (5).

* **Obstacle 30556:** Front-right, longitudinal 8.61m, lateral -1.87m.  The obstacle is approaching longitudinally. Lateral movement is minimal and negative.  Trajectory confirms a closing longitudinal distance. TTC is approximately 2.02 seconds (8.61m / 4.26m/s). MDC assessment suggests a low risk due to sufficient lateral separation. Overall: Low Risk (4) due to TTC.

* **Obstacle 30560:** Front, longitudinal 9.37m, lateral 0.00m. Laterally aligned but not a collision risk yet. Longitudinally approaching. TTC is approximately 2.20 seconds (9.37 / 4.26). MDC is low risk due to the longitudinal distance. Overall: Low Risk (4).

* **Obstacle 30561:** Front-right, longitudinal 0.75m, lateral -1.85m.  Very close longitudinally. Laterally to the right.  The small longitudinal distance raises serious concern.  TTC is approximately 0.19 seconds (0.75m / 3.89 m/s).  MDC is high risk due to the small longitudinal distance. The trajectory shows rapid longitudinal closing. Overall: Extreme Risk (1) due to very low TTC and close proximity with converging trajectories.

* **Obstacle 30563:** Front-left, longitudinal 8.49m, lateral 1.91m.  Approaching longitudinally, lateral distance is small but stable. Trajectory suggests no immediate lateral collision risk. TTC is approximately 2 seconds (8.49 / 4.26). Overall: Low Risk (4).

* **Obstacle 30564:** Front-left, longitudinal 8.42m, lateral 5.41m.  Similar to 30563 but further laterally, lowering the risk. TTC is approximately 1.98 seconds (8.42/4.26). Overall: Low Risk (4).

* **Obstacle 30568:** Left, longitudinal 0.00m, lateral 1.89m. Exact longitudinal alignment. The lateral distance is small but stable, and the obstacle appears to be moving away laterally.  No immediate collision risk. Overall: Medium Risk (3) due to proximity.

* **Obstacle 30570:** Collision, longitudinal 0.00m, lateral 0.00m. Both distances are zero, and relative velocity suggests a collision.  This is confirmed by the "Collision" designation.  Overall: Collision Risk (0).

* **Obstacle 30571:** Rear-right, longitudinal -0.60m, lateral -1.89m.  Behind and to the right of the ego vehicle. No collision risk. Overall: No Risk (5).

* **Obstacle 30574:** Front-left, longitudinal 0.86m, lateral 5.39m. Very close longitudinally, but lateral distance provides some margin. TTC is approximately 0.21 seconds (0.86/4.19). This poses an extreme risk. Overall: Extreme Risk (1) due to low TTC and close proximity.


**Conclusion:**

This is a collision scenario because Obstacle 30570 shows a Collision Risk (0). Additionally, Obstacles 30561 and 30574 represent Extreme Risks (1) with very low TTCs and converging trajectories, indicating likely collisions if no immediate action is taken.
