To analyze this scenario, we will assess each obstacle in the most recent timestep (4.1 seconds) using the adjusted distances and relative motion to determine collision risk levels.

### Obstacle Analysis at 4.1 Seconds

#### Obstacle 30555
- **Position**: Front-right
- **Adjusted Distances**: Longitudinal 18.98m, Lateral -10.55m
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal -4.26 m/s
- **Motion Description**: Driving toward the ego car longitudinally with no lateral motion

**Trajectory and Risk Assessment**:
- Given its large longitudinal distance and relatively low speed toward the ego vehicle, the immediate collision risk is low. 
- **TTC**: 18.98m / 4.26 m/s ≈ 4.45 seconds
- **MDC**: Well over 5.0 meters
- **Risk Level**: Low Risk (4)

#### Obstacle 30556
- **Position**: Front-right
- **Adjusted Distances**: Longitudinal 8.61m, Lateral -1.87m
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal -4.26 m/s
- **Motion Description**: Driving toward the ego car longitudinally with no lateral motion

**Trajectory and Risk Assessment**:
- The obstacle is approaching relatively quickly; however, its MDC suggests monitoring.
- **TTC**: 8.61m / 4.26 m/s ≈ 2.02 seconds
- **MDC**: Lateral distance maintains safety but needs longitudinal caution.
- **Risk Level**: Medium Risk (3)

#### Obstacle 30560
- **Position**: Front
- **Adjusted Distances**: Longitudinal 9.37m, Lateral 0.00m
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal -4.26 m/s
- **Motion Description**: Exact longitudinal alignment

**Trajectory and Risk Assessment**:
- Direct alignment but distance remains safely away with current rates.
- **TTC**: 9.37m / 4.26 m/s ≈ 2.20 seconds
- **MDC**: Longitudinal distance suggests moderate caution.
- **Risk Level**: Medium Risk (3)

#### Obstacle 30561
- **Position**: Front-right
- **Adjusted Distances**: Longitudinal 0.75m, Lateral -1.85m
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal -3.89 m/s
- **Motion Description**: Obstacle is driving toward the ego car laterally from the right

**Trajectory and Risk Assessment**:
- Critical due to minimal longitudinal distance and converging path.
- **TTC**: 0.75m / 3.89 m/s ≈ 0.19 seconds
- **MDC**: Extremely close in both longitudinal and lateral aspects.
- **Risk Level**: Extreme Risk (1)

#### Obstacle 30568
- **Position**: Left (exact longitudinal)
- **Adjusted Distances**: Longitudinal 0.00m, Lateral 1.89m
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal -3.16 m/s

**Trajectory and Risk Assessment**:
- Safe as trajectory diverges and remains lateral.
- **MDC**: Confirmed safe distance laterally.
- **Risk Level**: No Risk (5)

#### Obstacle 30570
- **Position**: Collision area (exact overlap)
- **Adjusted Distances**: Longitudinal 0.00m, Lateral 0.00m
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal -2.45 m/s

**Trajectory and Risk Assessment**:
- Collision is occurring as both distances are zero, exact overlap.
- **Risk Level**: Collision (0)

### Conclusion
This scenario is identified as a collision scenario because obstacle 30570 is in an exact collision state with the ego vehicle.
