- Overall Time Safety Score: 4
- Overall Risk Score: 4

- Obstacle ID: 30564
- Relative Direction: Front-left
- Distance Risk Reason: DTClong = 8.42m and DTClat = 5.41m signify safe longitudinal and lateral distances currently.  The obstacle has been moving closer longitudinally.
- Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 5
- Lateral Distance Safety Score: 4
- Overall Distance Safety Score: 4.5
- Time Risk Reason: TTClong = 1.98s and TTClat = inf suggest a safe time margin, though decreasing TTClong warrants continued observation.
- Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 3
- Lateral Time Safety Score: 5
- Overall Time Safety Score: 4
- Overall Risk Score: 4

- Obstacle ID: 30568
- Relative Direction: Left
- Distance Risk Reason: DTClong = 0.0m shows this obstacle is aligned longitudinally with the ego vehicle. DTClat = 1.89m indicates a small but presently safe lateral distance. The recent change in DTClong from values greater than zero suggests a potential passing maneuver by the obstacle.
- Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 0
- Lateral Distance Safety Score: 3
- Overall Distance Safety Score: 3
- Time Risk Reason: TTClong = 0.0s indicates no longitudinal safety margin. TTClat = inf suggests the obstacle is currently not on a collision course laterally. However, historical data and DTC values suggest a need to closely monitor this obstacle.
- Longitudinal Time Safety Score: 0
- Lateral Time Safety Score: 5
- Overall Time Safety Score: 5
- Overall Risk Score: 4

- Obstacle ID: 30570
- Relative Direction: Collision
- Distance Risk Reason: DTClong = 0.0m and DTClat = 0.0m indicates an imminent collision.
- Longitudinal Distance Safety Score: 0
- Lateral Distance Safety Score: 0
- Overall Distance Safety Score: 0
- Time Risk Reason: TTClong = 0.0s and TTClat = 0.0s indicate collision.
