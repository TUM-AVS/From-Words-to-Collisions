Here's the collision risk analysis:

**Ego Vehicle (30583):** The ego vehicle is consistently located in lanelet 811. Its velocity is decreasing, suggesting it might be braking.

**Obstacle 30573:** Stationary in lanelet 2084. Poses no immediate risk. Risk Score: 5

**Obstacle 30574:** Initially in lanelet 2102, this obstacle is moving with increasing velocity.  It does not appear to pose a risk throughout the provided timeframe. Risk Score: 5

**Obstacle 30575:** Located in lanelet 2101, this obstacle has a high and increasing velocity.  It does not appear to interact with the ego vehicle's path. Risk Score: 5

**Obstacle 30576:** Starts in lanelet 812. Its trajectory and increasing velocity suggest a potential risk if the ego vehicle were to change lanes or if its deceleration was insufficient. Given the separation and ego vehicle's braking, the risk is currently medium but warrants monitoring. Risk Score: 3

**Obstacle 30578:** Located in lanelet 829, it poses no immediate risk due to sufficient lateral separation from the ego vehicle. Risk Score: 5

**Obstacle 30579:** Stationary in lanelet 811 and directly in front of the ego vehicle. The ego vehicle is decelerating, so the risk is high and requires close observation, though a collision hasn't occurred. Risk Score: 2

**Obstacle 30581:** Initially in lanelet 2103 and moving with a moderate velocity. While not immediately risky, its movement should be monitored.  Risk Score: 4

**Obstacle 30582:** Located in lanelet 829, this obstacle poses no immediate risk to the ego vehicle due to the lateral separation. Risk Score: 5

Based on this analysis, Obstacle 30579 represents a high risk due to its stationary position in the ego vehicle's lane, while Obstacle 30576 requires careful observation as a medium risk due to its trajectory and velocity.  There are no imminent collisions.
