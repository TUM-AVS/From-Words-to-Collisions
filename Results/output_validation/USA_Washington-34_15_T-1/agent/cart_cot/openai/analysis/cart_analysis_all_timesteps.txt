### Analysis:

1. **Obstacle 30579.0**: This obstacle has remained stationary at every timestep, and it's in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle 811.0. The ego is decelerating, but since obstacle 30579 is in its path, it represents a significant risk. Although the ego is slowing down, continued proximity to a stopped object might lead to a collision if proper action is not taken.

2. **Obstacle 30576.0**: This obstacle is in the adjacent lanelet to the ego vehicle initially but came into the same lanelet as obstacle 30575.0. It shows consistent acceleration and thereby might change lanes or move unpredictably if the lane changes the behavior of the ego or other vehicles.

Ultimately, **obstacle 30579.0** poses the most significant risk since it is stationary in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle, and an imminent collision could occur due to the ego's gradual deceleration.
