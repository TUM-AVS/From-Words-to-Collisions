Obstacle 30579 is stationary in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle and poses a potential collision risk if the ego vehicle does not brake or steer.  The distance between the two is decreasing, and with the ego vehicle's decreasing velocity and negative acceleration, a collision is increasingly likely unless evasive action is taken.

Obstacle 30575 and 30576 are exhibiting concerning behavior.  They are moving at higher speeds than the ego vehicle and, at the most recent timestep, are in the same lanelet (2101.0). Although not immediately colliding, their continued trajectory and acceleration could pose an imminent threat within the next few timesteps.
