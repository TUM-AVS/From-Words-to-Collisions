To analyze the scenario, we need to focus on the most recent timestep (11.5 seconds) and use earlier ones for context on velocity and direction changes. Ego's position and velocity show it is almost stationary, and there is a slight deceleration. This context helps in deducing risks for each obstacle.

For the most recent timestep at 11.5 seconds:

1. **Obstacle 30573.0**: No movement from 10.6s - 11.5s (velocity = 0.0), static position in a separate lanelet. Not an immediate risk.
2. **Obstacle 30575.0**: In lanelet 2339.0, moving at 9.2096 m/s, but no direct collision course with Ego. Significant distance given Ego's position and direction of travel.
3. **Obstacle 30576.0**: In lanelet 2101.0, traveling at 7.4204 m/s, not heading directly towards Ego.
4. **Obstacle 30578.0**: Velocity shows significant decrease likely due to a change in its environment â€“ possibly a deceleration event beyond control. However, it maintains a distance from Ego with no evident intercept course.
5. **Obstacle 30579.0**: Static, in same lanelet as Ego. Shared lanelet, but absence of motion indicates no immediate collision risk.
6. **Obstacle 30581.0**: Traveling in a different lanelet - high velocity but positioned further and moving away.
7. **Obstacle 30582.0**: Initially had negative acceleration suggesting it's attempting a stop, but stabilization at the present velocity indicates managed risk, albeit slightly more complex due to its lanelet overlaps.

### Key Analysis:
- **Obstacle 30573.0**: No movement.
- **Obstacle 30579.0**: Stationary in the same lanelet; despite proximity, their respective positions are such that immediate contact is avoidable.

### Summary of Findings:
Both of these obstacles are stationary with no relative approach velocity, diminishing the immediate risk, whereas dynamically misaligned or decelerating vehicles can often present more complex interaction scenarios, but nothing outright extreme present in the snapshot.

Based on current data and reevaluation criteria, obstacles do not present an Extreme (1) or Collision (0) level risk.
