At timestamp 11.5 seconds:

* **Obstacle 30573**: Located front-left, longitudinally 19.93m away and moving closer at -0.73 m/s.  Poses low risk (5).
* **Obstacle 30575**: Located front-right, longitudinally 18.27m away and moving away at 2.90 m/s. Poses negligible risk (5).
* **Obstacle 30576**: Located in front, longitudinally 13.17m away and moving away at 1.61 m/s. Poses low risk (5).
* **Obstacle 30578**: Located front-left, longitudinally 8.75m away and moving away at 1.54 m/s. Lateral velocity is -5.08 m/s and the lateral acceleration just spiked to 4.98 m/s² which could be sensor noise. Still classifies as medium risk (3) at this point.
* **Obstacle 30579**: Located in front, longitudinally 0.39m away and moving closer at -0.73 m/s.  This is extremely close and represents an extreme risk (1).
* **Obstacle 30581**: Located front-left, longitudinally 18.20m away and moving away at 4.80 m/s. Poses negligible risk (5).
* **Obstacle 30582**: Located front-left, longitudinally 4.04m away and moving away at 1.23 m/s. While moving away longitudinally, the lateral motion (-4.38 m/s) and distance (19.68m) combined with a spike in lateral acceleration (2.06 m/s²) should be observed and warrant medium risk (3).

Risk Levels:
0: Collision - Physical contact occurred or unavoidable
1: Extreme Risk - Immediate collision likely
2: High Risk - Close to collision, needs quick action
3: Medium Risk - Manageable with proper reaction
4: Low Risk - Minimal risk, sufficient time to react
5: Negligible Risk - No significant risk
