### Safety analysis for timestep 11.5s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

First, we need to clarify the missing "adjusted distance" values.  Since they are critical for the analysis and not provided, I will assume for the purposes of this exercise that the provided distances already incorporate adjustments for vehicle size.  **In a real-world scenario, you would need the actual adjusted distances to perform accurate calculations.**

Given that obstacle 30579 has the smallest distance and a closing longitudinal velocity, I will focus the detailed TTC and MDC calculations on this obstacle. The lateral distance and velocity for Obstacle 30579 are zero, so lateral TTC (TTClat) and MDC will not be factors. 


**Obstacle 30579 Calculations:**

* **Longitudinal TTC (TTClong):** Distance / Closing Velocity = 0.39m / 0.73 m/s ≈ 0.53s
* **Longitudinal MDC:** Given the current closing velocity and short distance, MDC will effectively be the final distance at the point of collision, which is expected to be very close to zero.
