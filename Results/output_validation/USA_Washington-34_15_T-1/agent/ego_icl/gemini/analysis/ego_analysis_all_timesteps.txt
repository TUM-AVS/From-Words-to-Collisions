* **Obstacle 30573:** Front-left, moving towards ego longitudinally, laterally stable.  Longitudinal distance is large and decreasing slowly. Lateral distance is stable. Low risk.

* **Obstacle 30575:** Front-right, moving away from ego in both directions.  Low risk.

* **Obstacle 30576:** Front, moving away longitudinally, lateral distance near zero and decreasing. The lateral motion description indicates it is moving towards the ego laterally. This combined with near-zero lateral distance needs attention, but currently, longitudinal distance is sufficient. Medium risk due to the lateral movement.

* **Obstacle 30578:** Front-left, moving away longitudinally,  lateral distance is large and decreasing. Low risk.

* **Obstacle 30579:** Front, almost stationary laterally, longitudinal distance very small and decreasing, relative longitudinal velocity is negative meaning obstacle is driving toward the ego car.  Extreme risk of collision.

* **Obstacle 30581:** Front-left, moving away from ego longitudinally, lateral distance decreasing but still significant. Low risk.

* **Obstacle 30582:** Front-left, moving away longitudinally, lateral distance large. Low risk.
