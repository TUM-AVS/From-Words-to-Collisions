At t=11.7s, Ego is in lanelet 811 with a velocity of 0.56 m/s and decelerating at -0.32 m/sÂ². Obstacle 30579 is stationary in the same lanelet 811 at (-159.0572, 424.1037), while Ego is at (-163.3988, 426.0268).  The x-coordinates indicate a longitudinal separation, but the close y-coordinates suggest they are in the same lane. Given Ego's deceleration, a low-speed collision with Obstacle 30579 is highly likely in the next few seconds if Ego doesn't brake harder or steer away. Obstacle 30579 poses an extreme risk. No other obstacle poses a collision or extreme risk at this timestep.
