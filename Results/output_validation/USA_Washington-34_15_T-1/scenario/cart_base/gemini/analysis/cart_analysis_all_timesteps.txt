At t=11.7s, obstacle 30579 is stationary in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle, and their positions are very close: (-159.0572, 424.1037) vs. (-163.3988, 426.0268).  Given the ego vehicle's decelerating motion, a collision with obstacle 30579 is highly likely in the next timestep if the ego vehicle does not drastically change its trajectory.  This constitutes an Extreme Risk (1).  No other obstacles appear to pose immediate collision risks within the next timestep. Although obstacle 30575 and 30576 have high velocities, their trajectories do not appear to intersect with the ego's predicted path within the immediate next timestep.
