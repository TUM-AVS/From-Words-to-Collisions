### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. **Identify potential collisions:** Obstacle 30579.0 is in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle and is relatively close.
2. **Analyze trajectories:** The ego vehicle is decelerating while 30579.0 is stationary.
3. **Assess risk:** While not an immediate collision, the proximity and ego's deceleration make 30579.0 a high risk obstacle.  Other obstacles are moving away or are in different lanelets, posing no immediate threat.
4. **Collision Determination:** This is not a collision scenario as no obstacle has a risk score of 0. However, Obstacle 30579.0 presents a high risk.

### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
  "CollisionObstacles": [],
  "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null,
  "ScenarioAnalysis": {
    "IsCollisionScenario": false,
    "Reasoning": "No obstacle has a risk score of 0, indicating no collision. However, obstacle 30579.0 poses a high risk due to its proximity and the ego vehicle's deceleration in the same lanelet."
  }
