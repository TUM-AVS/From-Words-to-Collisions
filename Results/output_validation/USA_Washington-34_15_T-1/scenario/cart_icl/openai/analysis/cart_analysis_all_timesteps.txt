### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep:
Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

#### Obstacle ID: 30573.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is stationary and located at a significant distance from the ego vehicle, in a different lanelet.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: No movement thus no time risk.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 30575.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: This obstacle is moving fast away from the ego vehicle and has shown a trend of increasing distance with consistent acceleration.
- **Distance safety score**: 4
- **Time Risk reason**: Due to continually increasing distance and high speed (in excess of 9), no imminent collision appears likely.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 4.5

#### Obstacle ID: 30576.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: Although this obstacle is in a lane that may merge with or cross the ego vehicle's route, they are moving laterally away, reducing distance risk.
- **Distance safety score**: 4
- **Time Risk reason**: The trajectory supports a low likelihood of a collision, as the relative velocity and acceleration have kept consistent with not reducing the gap to the ego vehicle.
- **Time safety score**: 4
- **Overall Risk score**: 4

#### Obstacle ID: 30578.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: Positioned ahead and moving away, showing a strong acceleration away from the ego vehicle’s position.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: Negative acceleration in the last timestamps briefly suggested a slowing down, but trajectory continues to diverge.
- **Time safety score**: 4
- **Overall Risk score**: 4.5

#### Obstacle ID: 30579.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: Despite being in the same lanelet as the ego, it is stationary and positioned slightly behind.
- **Distance safety score**: 4
- **Time Risk reason**: Stationary nature means no time risk is presented.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 4.5

#### Obstacle ID: 30581.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: It moves swiftly differently oriented and distanced sufficiently from ego vehicle with no immediate threat.
- **Distance safety score**: 4
- **Time Risk reason**: Consistent relative high-speed trajectory showing no tendency to intercept the ego vehicle’s path.
- **Time safety score**: 4.5
- **Overall Risk score**: 4

#### Obstacle ID: 30582.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: Although within proximity, remains on a trajectory parallel to the ego vehicle's course.
- **Distance safety score**: 4
- **Time Risk reason**: Parallel advance trajectory suggests negligible closing time, reducing temporal collision risk.
- **Time safety score**: 4.5
- **Overall Risk score**: 4.25

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
None of the obstacles at the most recent timestep present an immediate collision threat due to either being stationary or on diverging trajectories from the ego vehicle. The history of movements and velocities consistently supports the conclusion of no collision risk.
