Obstacle 30579 shows a very high risk of collision. It is almost directly in front of the ego vehicle (0.24m longitudinally and 0.00m laterally) and moving towards the ego car longitudinally at a closing speed of -0.56 m/s.  Although the relative longitudinal acceleration is positive (0.29 m/sÂ²), suggesting the closing speed is decreasing, the proximity and the longitudinal motion indicate a likely collision in the next few moments.
