Obstacle 30579 is only 0.24 meters in front of the ego vehicle and approaching longitudinally at -0.56 m/s. Although the relative velocity is small, the proximity makes this obstacle a high collision risk.

**Risk Levels and Definitions:**
<Collision (Score: 0)>: Actual collision has occurred or is unavoidable within the next timestep.
<Extreme Risk (Score: 1)>: Immediate collision or very high likelihood of impact. Urgent action is required.
<High Risk (Score: 2)>: Close to collision or highly probable collision path. Needs prompt attention and quick manoeuvring.
<Medium Risk (Score: 3)>: Moderate collision risk but manageable with timely reactions and proper strategies.
<Low Risk (Score: 4)>: Minimal collision risk. The situation is controllable with sufficient time to react.
<Negligible Risk (Score: 5)>: No significant collision risk. Obstacles are either moving away or far enough not to interfere.

  },
  "ScenarioAnalysis": {
    "IsCollisionScenario": false,
    "Reasoning": "Obstacle 30579 poses an extreme risk due to its very close proximity to the ego vehicle (0.24m) and longitudinal approach, despite the low relative velocity. While not an immediate collision, a slight increase in velocity or a minor delay in reaction could lead to a collision in the next few moments."
