### Safety analysis for timestep 10.8s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 30573
- Distance Risk reason:  20.83m longitudinally and laterally distant, in front-left. No immediate risk.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Approaching longitudinally (-1.66 m/s), but decelerating (0.64 m/s²).  TTC calculation is complex due to changing velocity, but the distance suggests reasonable time.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3

- Obstacle ID: 30575
- Distance Risk reason: 16.87m longitudinally and laterally distant, in front-right. Moving away both longitudinally and laterally.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Moving away (1.20 m/s longitudinally, -7.46 m/s laterally). No collision risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 30576
- Distance Risk reason: 12.51m longitudinally and laterally distant, in front-left. Moderate lateral approach.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Moving away longitudinally (0.45 m/s) but approaching laterally (-5.97 m/s), though decelerating laterally (-1.82 m/s²).  Requires monitoring.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3

- Obstacle ID: 30578
- Distance Risk reason: 8.03m longitudinally and laterally distant, in front-left. Closer proximity increases risk.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: Moving away longitudinally (0.41 m/s) but approaching laterally (-4.63 m/s). Decelerating laterally (-0.91 m/s²) reduces risk somewhat.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3

- Obstacle ID: 30579
- Distance Risk reason: 1.28m longitudinally and laterally distant, in front. Extremely close proximity.
- Distance safety score: 1
- Time Risk reason: Approaching longitudinally (-1.66 m/s). Very high risk of collision.
- Time safety score: 1
- Overall Risk score: 1

- Obstacle ID: 30581
- Distance Risk reason: 15.92m longitudinally and laterally distant, in front-left.  Relatively safe distance.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Moving away longitudinally (1.93 m/s) and approaching laterally (-4.84 m/s). Lateral deceleration (-2.05 m/s²) lessens the risk.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- Obstacle ID: 30582
- Distance Risk reason: 3.64m longitudinally and laterally distant, in front-left.  Close proximity.
- Distance safety score: 2
- Time Risk reason: Slightly approaching longitudinally (-0.07 m/s) and approaching laterally (-3.58 m/s). Lateral deceleration (-1.94 m/s²) reduces risk somewhat.
- Time safety score: 2
- Overall Risk score: 2



### Safety analysis for timestep 10.9s - 11.7s:
*Similar analysis as above for each timestep, focusing on distance, relative velocity/acceleration, and resulting TTC.  Note the changing risk levels as obstacles move.* 

**Key Observations Across Timesteps for Obstacle 30579:**

Obstacle 30579 consistently presents the highest risk throughout the scenario.  Its longitudinal distance to the ego vehicle decreases significantly over the timesteps while exhibiting negative longitudinal velocity.  This indicates a very high probability of collision if no evasive action is taken. At 11.7 seconds the longitudinal distance is only 0.24m.

**Other Obstacles:**
While other obstacles have varying degrees of risk, none consistently show as high a risk as 30579.  Most obstacles are either moving away longitudinally or have sufficient lateral distance to mitigate collision risk, especially with noted decelerations.

### Summary in JSON Format for 11.7 seconds:
```json
{
    "CollisionObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "30579",
        "OverallRiskScore": "1"
    },
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null,
    "IsCollisionScenario": true,
    "Justification": "Obstacle 30579 is extremely close (0.24m) and approaching the ego vehicle longitudinally.  Despite a small negative relative velocity, the proximity and movement trend strongly suggest an imminent collision if no action is taken."

Important Considerations:

* Precise TTC calculations are complex with changing accelerations and require more sophisticated formulas than simple linear projections.  The analysis provided here is a simplified qualitative assessment.
* The 0.1s time increments provide a reasonable granularity for analysis but might not capture very rapid changes in motion.
* Real-world autonomous driving systems would consider additional factors like vehicle size, shape, and predicted trajectories for a more comprehensive risk assessment.
