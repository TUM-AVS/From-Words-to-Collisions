Let me analyze the most recent timestep (11.7 seconds) for collision risks:

1. Obstacle 30573 (Front-left):
   - Longitudinal: 19.79m (approaching at -0.56m/s)
   - Lateral: 4.47m (stable)
   - TTC: Not applicable (lateral stable, longitudinal too far)
   - MDC: 4.47m (lateral)
   - Risk: 4 (Low Risk)

2. Obstacle 30575 (Front-right):
   - Longitudinal: 18.87m (moving away at 3.27m/s)
   - Lateral: -14.74m (moving away at -8.79m/s)
   - TTC: Negative (diverging)
   - MDC: >5m
   - Risk: 5 (No Risk)

3. Obstacle 30576 (Front-right):
   - Longitudinal: 13.50m (moving away at 1.86m/s)
   - Lateral: -0.64m (moving away at -7.35m/s)
   - TTC: Negative (diverging)
   - MDC: 0.64m (lateral)
   - Risk: 4 (Low Risk)

4. Obstacle 30578 (Front-left):
   - Longitudinal: 9.01m (moving away at 1.28m/s)
   - Lateral: 8.21m (approaching at -4.13m/s)
   - TTC: Lateral: 8.21/4.13 = 1.99s
   - MDC: 8.21m (lateral)
   - Risk: 3 (Medium Risk)

5. Obstacle 30579 (Front):
   - Longitudinal: 0.24m (approaching at -0.56m/s)
   - Lateral: 0.00m (aligned)
   - TTC: 0.24/0.56 = 0.43s
   - MDC: 0.24m
   - Risk: 1 (Extreme Risk)

6. Obstacle 30581 (Front-left):
   - Longitudinal: 19.23m (moving away at 5.56m/s)
   - Lateral: 0.43m (approaching at -4.32m/s)
   - TTC: Lateral: 0.43/4.32 = 0.10s
   - MDC: 0.43m
   - Risk: 1 (Extreme Risk)

7. Obstacle 30582 (Front-left):
   - Longitudinal: 4.27m (moving away at 1.23m/s)
   - Lateral: 18.85m (approaching at -4.02m/s)
   - TTC: Lateral: 18.85/4.02 = 4.69s
   - MDC: 4.27m
   - Risk: 4 (Low Risk)

Critical Observations:
- Obstacle 30579 is extremely close (0.24m) with TTC of 0.43s - Extreme Risk
- Obstacle 30581 has lateral TTC of just 0.10s - Extreme Risk
- Both are converging with the ego vehicle
