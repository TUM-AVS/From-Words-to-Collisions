To properly assess the risk of collision for the ego vehicle at the most recent timestamp (11.7 seconds) with the obstacles, I will focus on analyzing the data for each obstacle. The adjusted distances account for vehicle size, providing a more accurate analysis for the risk assessment. I'll calculate TTC (Time-to-Collision) where applicable, MDC (Minimum Distance to Collision), and then provide risk scores.

**Obstacle Analysis at 11.7 seconds:**

### Obstacle 30573 (Front-left)
- **Adjusted Longitudinal Distance:** 19.79 m
- **Adjusted Lateral Distance:** 4.47 m
- **Relative Velocity (Longitudinal):** -0.56 m/s (approaching)
- **Motion:** Driving toward the ego vehicle longitudinally, no lateral relative motion.

**Risk Assessment:**
- **TTC (Longitudinal):** 19.79 m / 0.56 m/s â‰ˆ 35.34 seconds
- **MDC:** Approx. 19.79 m as lateral relative motion is zero.

**Risk Score:** 5 (No Risk, sufficient distance and high TTC)

### Obstacle 30575 (Front-right)
- **Adjusted Longitudinal Distance:** 18.87 m
- **Adjusted Lateral Distance:** -14.74 m
- **Relative Velocity (Longitudinal):** 3.27 m/s (moving away)
- **Motion:** Moving away both longitudinally and laterally to the right.

**Risk Assessment:**
- **MDC:** Increasing due to diverging path.

**Risk Score:** 5 (No Risk, paths diverging)

### Obstacle 30576 (Front-right)
- **Adjusted Longitudinal Distance:** 13.50 m
- **Adjusted Lateral Distance:** -0.64 m
- **Relative Velocity (Longitudinal):** 1.86 m/s (moving away)
- **Motion:** Moving away both longitudinally and laterally.

**Risk Assessment:**
- **MDC:** Both dimensions suggest increasing separation.

**Risk Score:** 5 (No Risk, moving away)

### Obstacle 30578 (Front-left)
- **Adjusted Longitudinal Distance:** 9.01 m
- **Adjusted Lateral Distance:** 8.21 m
- **Relative Velocity (Longitudinal):** 1.28 m/s (moving away)
- **Motion:** Moving away longitudinally, driving toward the ego car laterally.

**Risk Assessment:**
- **MDC:** Lateral approach, but overall trajectory and distance are safe.

**Risk Score:** 5 (No Risk, distance adequate)

### Obstacle 30579 (Front)
- **Adjusted Longitudinal Distance:** 0.24 m
- **Adjusted Lateral Distance:** 0.00 m
- **Relative Velocity (Longitudinal):** -0.56 m/s (approaching)
- **Motion:** Driving toward the ego car longitudinally.

**Risk Assessment:**
- **TTC (Longitudinal):** 0.24 m / 0.56 m/s = 0.43 seconds
- **MDC:** Approximately 0.24 m, with a direct path of approach.

**Risk Score:** 0 (Collision Risk, very low distance, aligning path)

### Obstacle 30581 (Front-left)
- **Adjusted Longitudinal Distance:** 19.23 m
- **Adjusted Lateral Distance:** 0.43 m
- **Relative Velocity (Longitudinal):** 5.56 m/s (moving away)
- **Motion:** Moving away longitudinally, approaching laterally.

**Risk Assessment:**
- **MDC:** No immediate collision trajectory noted.

**Risk Score:** 5 (No Risk, overall divergent motion)

### Obstacle 30582 (Front-left)
- **Adjusted Longitudinal Distance:** 4.27 m
- **Adjusted Lateral Distance:** 18.85 m
- **Relative Velocity (Longitudinal):** 1.23 m/s (moving away)
- **Motion:** Moving away longitudinally, laterally converging slowly.

**Risk Assessment:**
- **MDC:** Safe lateral distance and motion trajectory.

**Risk Score:** 5 (No Risk, adequate spacing)

### Collision Scenario Determination:
The risk assessment indicates that Obstacle 30579 is the most critical with a collision risk score of 0. Thus, this is explicitly identified as a collision scenario.
