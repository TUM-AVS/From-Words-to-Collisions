Obstacle 3130 is the only obstacle sharing the same lanelet (7210) as the ego vehicle for a significant portion of the provided timeframe.  Initially, obstacle 3130's y-coordinate is greater than the ego vehicle's, placing it ahead of the ego vehicle.  However, both the y-coordinate and velocity of obstacle 3130 decrease over time, while the ego vehicle's velocity remains relatively constant. This converging behavior indicates a possible collision risk. Further, the x coordinates of ego and obstacle 3130 are getting closer.  By 0.5 seconds the ego vehicle has moved into lanelet 8289, and the risk decreases slightly. However, the history of close proximity and convergence in the same lanelet suggests a need to closely monitor this obstacle. There is no sign of immediate collision in next timestep, so the risk score is 2 rather than 1.
