Obstacle 3130 is in the same lane as the ego vehicle (lanelet 7210) and initially poses a potential risk.  Analyzing the trajectories, obstacle 3130 starts relatively close to the ego vehicle but its velocity decreases over the timesteps while the ego vehicle maintains a consistent velocity.  By 0.8 seconds, obstacle 3130 changes to lanelet 5623, significantly reducing the risk of collision.  Although other vehicles are present, they are in different lanelets and their trajectories do not suggest an immediate risk of collision with the ego vehicle.
