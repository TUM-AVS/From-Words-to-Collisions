### Analysis:

1. **Obstacle 3130**: 
   - Located in the same lanelet (7210.0) as the ego vehicle at 0.1s, but moves to lanelet 5623.0 by 0.8s.
   - Relative longitudinal position: Ego is ahead of the obstacle (~12m at 0.1s, decreasing to ~11m by 0.9s).
   - Relative longitudinal velocity: Ego is moving faster (~3 m/s difference), so the obstacle is not a direct threat.
   - Lateral distance: Increasing as the obstacle moves to a different lanelet.
   - **Risk: Low (4)**.

2. **Obstacle 3140**: 
   - Located in lanelet 5947.0 (adjacent to ego's lanelet 7210.0/8289.0).
   - Relative lateral position: Moving away from the ego vehicle (Y-coordinate increasing from -348.8799 to -355.05216).
   - Relative velocity: Obstacle is moving faster (~8.59 m/s vs. ego's ~10.32 m/s) but in a diverging direction.
   - **Risk: Negligible (5)**.

3. **Obstacle 3124**: 
   - Located in lanelet 5623.0 (opposite direction lanelet).
   - Relative position: Far ahead (~25m at 0.1s, increasing to ~25m by 0.9s).
   - Relative velocity: Obstacle is moving away (~7.23 m/s vs. ego's ~10.32 m/s).
   - **Risk: Negligible (5)**.

4. **Obstacle 324**: 
   - Located in lanelet 8235.0 (not overlapping with ego's path).
   - Relative position: Far behind (~15m at 0.1s, increasing to ~18m by 0.9s).
   - Relative velocity: Obstacle is moving much slower (~2.21 m/s vs. ego's ~10.32 m/s).
   - **Risk: Negligible (5)**.

5. **Obstacle 350**: 
   - Located in lanelet 5626.0 (not overlapping with ego's path).
   - Relative position: Far behind (~25m at 0.1s, increasing to ~28m by 0.9s).
   - Relative velocity: Obstacle is moving much slower (~1.38 m/s vs. ego's ~10.32 m/s).
   - **Risk: Negligible (5)**.
