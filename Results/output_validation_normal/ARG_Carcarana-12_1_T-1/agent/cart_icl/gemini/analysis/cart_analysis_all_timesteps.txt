Here's the collision risk assessment for the provided scenario at t=0.9s:

**Analysis of Obstacles at t=0.9s:**

The primary focus is on the latest timestep (0.9s) with consideration for the trends from previous timesteps.  Since no dimensions of the vehicles are given, it is assumed they are point masses.

* **Obstacle 324:**  This obstacle poses no immediate risk. It's located in a different lanelet and maintains a safe lateral and longitudinal distance from the ego vehicle.

* **Obstacle 350:** Similar to Obstacle 324, this one is also in a different lanelet with a safe lateral and longitudinal separation, posing no immediate risk.

* **Obstacle 3124:**  Located in a different lanelet than the ego vehicle, this obstacle maintains a safe distance and exhibits no concerning behavior.

* **Obstacle 3130:** Though this obstacle shares the same lanelet with the ego vehicle initially, it moves into a different lanelet (5623.0) by 0.8 seconds, reducing risk.  Its motion suggests it is diverging away from the ego vehicle's path.

* **Obstacle 3140:** This obstacle is in a different lanelet and its trajectory does not intersect with the ego vehicle's path, presenting no immediate risk.
