At t=0.9s, Obstacle 3130 is the closest to the ego vehicle with a longitudinal distance of 7.98m and a lateral distance of 2.81m, and it's moving closer longitudinally (-4.62 m/s) and laterally (3.22 m/s).  While it's approaching, the lateral motion suggests it might be changing lanes.  It presents a potential risk, requiring careful monitoring. Other obstacles are further away and moving away from the ego vehicle or are longitudinally aligned and moving in the same direction as the ego vehicle, making them lower risk. However, obstacle 3130 poses a medium risk due to its proximity and converging trajectory.
