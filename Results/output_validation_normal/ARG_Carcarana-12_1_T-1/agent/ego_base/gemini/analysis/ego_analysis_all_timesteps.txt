At t=0.9s:
- Obstacle 324: Rear-right, moving away longitudinally, but laterally approaching the ego vehicle.  Lateral distance is decreasing, posing a potential risk if this trend continues. Risk level: Medium (3)
- Obstacle 350: Rear-right, moving away both longitudinally and laterally. Poses no immediate threat. Risk level: Negligible (5)
- Obstacle 3124: Front-left, moving towards the ego longitudinally and away laterally. The lateral movement reduces the risk.  Risk level: Low (4)
- Obstacle 3130: Front-left, moving towards the ego longitudinally and away laterally, similar to 3124.  Its closer proximity longitudinally requires monitoring. Risk level: Medium (3).
- Obstacle 3140: Rear-left, moving away longitudinally, but approaching the ego laterally and faster compared to previous timesteps. Its lateral velocity is the highest of all obstacles, posing a potential risk if it continues on this trajectory. Risk level: Medium (3)
