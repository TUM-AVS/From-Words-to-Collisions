### Safety analysis for timestep 0.9s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

**Assumptions and Clarifications:**

* **Missing Adjusted Distances:** The provided scenario lacks adjusted longitudinal and lateral distances (adjusted_d_long, adjusted_d_lat).  This is critical for accurate TTC and MDC calculations. I will proceed with the analysis using the provided *real* distances (DTClong, DTClat), but the results will be less reliable.  **You must provide adjusted distances for a proper safety assessment.**
* **TTC Calculation:** TTC will be calculated as DTClong / Vrel_long (longitudinal TTC) and DTClat / Vrel_lat (lateral TTC). Negative TTC values indicate the objects are moving away from each other.
* **MDC Approximation:**  Without adjusted distances and vehicle dimensions, a true MDC cannot be calculated. I will use the smallest *real* distance observed in the provided timesteps as a proxy for MDC. This is a rough estimate.

### Obstacle Analysis:

**- Obstacle ID: 324**
- Distance Risk reason: Located rear-right with negative longitudinal and lateral distances, indicating separation but previous time steps showed a high lateral risk.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Negative TTC in both directions.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 4

**- Obstacle ID: 350**
- Distance Risk reason: Located rear-right with significant negative longitudinal and lateral distances.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Negative TTC in both directions.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

**- Obstacle ID: 3124**
- Distance Risk reason: Located front-left, large positive DTClong and DTClat suggest no immediate risk.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Positive TTClong suggests potential longitudinal collision risk if the lateral movement does not diverge enough.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3

**- Obstacle ID: 3130**
- Distance Risk reason: Located front-left but relatively small positive DTClong and DTClat.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: Positive TTClong; potential longitudinal collision if lateral movement does not clear it.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3

**- Obstacle ID: 3140**
- Distance Risk reason: Located rear-left, significant negative DTClong and DTClat.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Negative TTC in both directions.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5
