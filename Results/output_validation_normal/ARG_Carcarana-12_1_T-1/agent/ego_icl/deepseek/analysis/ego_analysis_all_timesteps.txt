### Key Observations:
1. **No Collision or Extreme Risk**: All obstacles maintain sufficient distance or are moving away in critical dimensions.  
2. **Highest Risks**: Obstacles 3130 (Front-left) and 3140 (Rear-left) have Medium Risk (Score 3) due to closing distances in one dimension.  
3. **Low Risk**: Obstacle 3124 (Front-left) has Low Risk (Score 4) as it approaches slowly.  
4. **Negligible Risk**: Obstacles 324 and 350 (Rear-right) pose no immediate threat.  

### Trajectory Trends:
- **Obstacle 3130**: Longitudinal distance decreases steadily (8.55m → 7.98m in 0.9s), but lateral distance increases (6.58m → 2.81m).  
- **Obstacle 3140**: Lateral distance closes rapidly (5.35m → 11.42m in 0.9s) but remains manageable.  

### Final Note:
The ego vehicle should monitor Obstacles 3130 and 3140 for potential lateral/longitudinal adjustments, but no urgent action is required.
