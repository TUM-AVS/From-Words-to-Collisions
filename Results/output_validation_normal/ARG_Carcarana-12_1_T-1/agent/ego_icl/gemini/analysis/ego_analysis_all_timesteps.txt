Obstacle 324: This obstacle is consistently to the right of the ego vehicle and slightly behind it in the most recent timestep.  The longitudinal distance has become negative, indicating it is behind the ego vehicle, while the lateral distance remains relatively stable around -9.73m. The lateral velocity shows the obstacle is moving towards the ego vehicle, but slowly at 1.10 m/s. Given the lateral distance, even with the closing velocity, a collision is unlikely in the near future.  
* TTC (lateral): 9.73m / 1.10m/s = 8.85s
* MDC: Approximately 9.73m (using the lateral distance as the primary measure).
* Risk: 5 (Negligible Risk)

Obstacle 350: This obstacle is to the rear-right of the ego vehicle and moving further away.  The longitudinal and lateral distances are increasing. Both longitudinal and lateral velocities are negative in the most recent timestep.
* TTC is not applicable as the obstacle is moving away.
* MDC: > 14.69m
* Risk: 5 (Negligible Risk)


Obstacle 3124: This obstacle is in the front-left and moving away laterally but approaching longitudinally. The longitudinal distance is increasing slowly while the lateral distance is decreasing. The primary concern is the longitudinal motion.
* TTC (longitudinal): 19.35m / 4.04m/s = 4.79s
* MDC: Approximately 9.29m (using the smallest distance).
* Risk: 4 (Low Risk)

Obstacle 3130: This obstacle is in the front-left of the ego vehicle and moving away laterally while approaching longitudinally. It poses some risk as the longitudinal distance is decreasing while the lateral distance decreases slowly.
* TTC (longitudinal): 7.98m / 4.62m/s = 1.73s
* MDC: approximately 2.81m.
* Risk: 3 (Medium Risk)

Obstacle 3140: This obstacle is to the rear-left of the ego vehicle. While it is moving closer laterally to the ego vehicle (-7.30 m/s), its longitudinal distance is increasing, moving it further away from the ego vehicle. 
* TTC (lateral): 11.42m / 7.30m/s = 1.56s
* MDC: approximately 11.42m
* Risk: 3 (Medium Risk)
