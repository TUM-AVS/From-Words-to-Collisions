Let's analyze the collision risk for each obstacle using the provided information based on the most recent timestep at 0.9 seconds, while considering their trajectory data over the previous steps.

### Obstacle Analysis

#### Obstacle 324 (Rear-right)
- **Position**: Rear-right of the ego car
- **Adjusted Distances**: Longitudinal -10.51 m, Lateral -9.73 m
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal -8.40 m/s, Lateral 1.10 m/s
- **Motion**: Obstacle is moving away longitudinally, driving towards the ego car laterally

**Trajectory Analysis**:
- The longitudinal distance is increasing and the obstacle is moving away longitudinally, implying reducing collision risk. 
- Lateral distance is decreasing slightly with positive lateral velocity, which indicates it's converging laterally.

**Risk Assessment**:
- Relative velocity and position indicate no immediate collision risk longitudinally, but lateral convergence should be watched.
- **Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC)**: Considering the lateral approach, MDC is still significant > 10m.
- **Time-to-Collision (TTC)**: Longitudinal is not applicable (moving apart). Lateral TTC = 9.73m / 1.10 m/s = 8.85s.

**Overall Risk**: 
- **Risk Level 5**: Given the distances and diverging long trajectory, negligible risk.

#### Obstacle 350 (Rear-right)
- **Position**: Rear-right of the ego car
- **Adjusted Distances**: Longitudinal -19.18 m, Lateral -14.69 m
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal -9.12 m/s, Lateral 0.69 m/s
- **Motion**: Obstacle is moving away longitudinally, driving towards the ego laterally

**Trajectory Analysis**:
- Longitudinal distance is increasing as the obstacle moves away.
- Lateral distance shows slight convergence.

**Risk Assessment**:
- **MDC**: Significant over 14m laterally.
- **TTC**: Longitudinal not applicable. Lateral TTC = 14.69m / 0.69 m/s = 21.28s.

**Overall Risk**: 
- **Risk Level 5**: Negligible risk as distances are large with increasing longitudinal separation.

#### Obstacle 3124 (Front-left)
- **Position**: Front-left of the ego car
- **Adjusted Distances**: Longitudinal 19.35 m, Lateral 9.29 m
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal -4.04 m/s, Lateral 3.59 m/s
- **Motion**: Driving toward ego car longitudinally, moving laterally left.

**Trajectory Analysis**:
- Both longitudinal and lateral distances are increasing, indicating moving away.

**Risk Assessment**:
- **MDC**: Over 9m laterally.
- **TTC**: Longitudinally and laterally both result in high numbers (diverging).

**Overall Risk**: 
- **Risk Level 5**: Both movements indicate expanding distances and no immediate threat.

#### Obstacle 3130 (Front-left)
- **Position**: Front-left of the ego car
- **Adjusted Distances**: Longitudinal 7.98 m, Lateral 2.81 m
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal -4.62 m/s, Lateral 3.22 m/s
- **Motion**: Driving toward ego car longitudinally, moving away laterally.

**Trajectory Analysis**:
- Both distances decreasing but with obstruction moving laterally away.

**Risk Assessment**:
- **MDC**: Over 2m laterally.
- **TTC**: Longitudinally, TTC = 7.98m / 4.62 m/s = 1.73s (medium).
- **TTC Lateral**: 2.81m / 3.22 m/s = 0.87s (high).

**Overall Risk**: 
- **Risk Level 2**: High risk mainly due to lateral convergence.

#### Obstacle 3140 (Rear-left)
- **Position**: Rear-left of the ego car
- **Adjusted Distances**: Longitudinal -13.56 m, Lateral 11.42 m
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal -5.80 m/s, Lateral -7.30 m/s
- **Motion**: Moving away longitudinally, driving toward laterally

**Trajectory Analysis**:
- Longitudinal distance increasing as moving away but laterally converging fast.

**Risk Assessment**:
- **MDC**: Over 11m laterally.
- **TTC Lateral**: 11.42m / 7.30 m/s = 1.56s.

**Overall Risk**: 
- **Risk Level 3**: Medium risk due to lateral convergence.
