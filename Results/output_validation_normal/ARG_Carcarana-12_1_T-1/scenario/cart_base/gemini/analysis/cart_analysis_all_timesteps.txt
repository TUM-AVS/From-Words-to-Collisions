At t=0.9s, Ego is in lanelet 8289. Let's analyze the closest obstacles:

* **Obstacle 324:** Located in lanelet 8235. While relatively close laterally, its longitudinal distance and differing direction of travel suggest low risk.
* **Obstacle 350:** Located in lanelet 5626.  Farther away than 324 and poses no immediate threat.
* **Obstacle 3124:** Located in lanelet 5623.  Not a concern due to distance.
* **Obstacle 3130:** Located in lanelet 5623. Not a concern due to distance.
* **Obstacle 3140:** Located in lanelet 5947.  Despite its higher velocity, its lateral distance and trajectory do not indicate an immediate collision risk.


Therefore, at t=0.9s, no obstacles present a collision or extreme risk.
