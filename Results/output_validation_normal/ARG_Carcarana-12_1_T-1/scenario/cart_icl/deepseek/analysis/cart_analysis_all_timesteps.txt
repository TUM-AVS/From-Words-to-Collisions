   - **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: Moving away with high velocity (8.59 m/s).
   - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. **Lanelet Analysis**: Ego is in lanelet 8289.0, and no obstacles share this lanelet at the most recent timestep.
2. **Trajectory Analysis**: All obstacles are either moving away or maintaining a safe distance.
3. **Velocity/Acceleration Trends**: No obstacles show converging trajectories or high-risk velocity profiles.
4. **Conclusion**: No immediate or extreme collision risks detected.
