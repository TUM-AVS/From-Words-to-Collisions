- Obstacle ID: 390.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is far away and poses no immediate risk.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: No risk due to distance and relative velocity.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 391.0
- Distance Risk reason:  Laterally far away and poses no immediate risk.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: No risk due to distance, despite high speed.
- Time safety score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 3102.0
- Distance Risk reason:  Far away and poses no immediate risk.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: No risk due to distance and relative velocity.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 3124.0
- Distance Risk reason: Laterally separated, minimal risk based on current trajectory.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason:  Moving somewhat faster than ego but not on a direct collision course.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- Obstacle ID: 3130.0
- Distance Risk reason: In the same lanelet but sufficiently ahead and diverging slightly due to the ego vehicle's lane change.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason:  Moving slower than the ego vehicle. The risk is reduced further by the ego vehicle's lane change.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4


- Obstacle ID: 3140.0
- Distance Risk reason: Not in the same lane, and ego is changing lanes away from it.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: No time risk given separation and divergence in paths.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 3147.0
- Distance Risk reason: Not in the same lane, and ego is changing lanes away from it.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: No time risk given separation and divergence in paths.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5


### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
This is not a collision scenario. No obstacles are on a direct collision course with the ego vehicle. The ego vehicle is changing lanes, further mitigating any potential risks from obstacles 3130, 3140 and 3147. Other vehicles maintain safe lateral and longitudinal separation.

### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
  "CollisionObstacles": null,
  "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null,
  "ScenarioAnalysis": {
    "IsCollisionScenario": false,
    "Reasoning": "No obstacles are on a direct collision course with the ego vehicle at the most recent timestep.  The ego vehicle's lane change mitigates risk from obstacle 3130, 3140 and 3147. All other obstacles maintain safe separation."
