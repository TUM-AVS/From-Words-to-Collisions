### Obstacle Analysis at 0.9 Seconds:

#### Obstacle 324.0:
- **Distance Risk Reason**: Obstacle 324.0 has maintained a relatively constant lateral separation from the ego vehicle and is moving away longitudinally. 
- **Distance Safety Score**: 5
- **Time Risk Reason**: The obstacle's velocity and acceleration suggest minimal changes in its trajectory relative to the ego vehicle, continuing to move away.
- **Time Safety Score**: 5
- **Overall Risk Score**: 5

#### Obstacle 350.0:
- **Distance Risk Reason**: Obstacle 350.0 remains at a fairly constant distance laterally and is located far from the ego vehicle. 
- **Distance Safety Score**: 5
- **Time Risk Reason**: The low velocity and positive acceleration indicate it continues to move slowly in its lane.
- **Time Safety Score**: 5
- **Overall Risk Score**: 5

#### Obstacle 379.0:
- **Distance Risk Reason**: Obstacle 379.0 is moving on a much different trajectory well below the y-coordinate of the ego vehicle.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 5
- **Time Risk Reason**: It has little to no potential for collision given its consistent trajectory and significant separation.
- **Time Safety Score**: 5
- **Overall Risk Score**: 5

#### Obstacle 390.0:
- **Distance Risk Reason**: It follows a parallel path on a different trajectory, located well below the ego vehicle's path.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 5
- **Time Risk Reason**: Its speed and direction are constant, and it's moving away from the ego vehicle.
- **Time Safety Score**: 5
- **Overall Risk Score**: 5

#### Obstacle 391.0:
- **Distance Risk Reason**: Obstacle 391.0 moves rapidly away from the ego, on a different path entirely.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 5
- **Time Risk Reason**: High velocity away from the ego vehicle ensures no collision risk.
- **Time Safety Score**: 5
- **Overall Risk Score**: 5

#### Obstacle 3102.0:
- **Distance Risk Reason**: This obstacle takes on a more parallel path that doesn’t intersect with the ego vehicle's path.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 5
- **Time Risk Reason**: Stable velocity ensures separation.
- **Time Safety Score**: 5
- **Overall Risk Score**: 5

#### Obstacle 3124.0:
- **Distance Risk Reason**: Positioned distinctly apart from the ego vehicle’s direct trajectory, with matching speed.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 5
- **Time Risk Reason**: Consistent velocity and direction, maintaining a stable path.
- **Time Safety Score**: 5
- **Overall Risk Score**: 5

#### Obstacle 3130.0:
- **Distance Risk Reason**: Positioned behind and moving away in the ego's lanelet.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 5
- **Time Risk Reason**: Decreasing relative velocity as it moves away from the ego vehicle.
- **Time Safety Score**: 5
- **Overall Risk Score**: 5

#### Obstacle 3140.0:
- **Distance Risk Reason**: With its lateral motion, it maintains a wide berth from the ego’s lane.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 5
- **Time Risk Reason**: Steady acceleration suggests it maintains a constant path separate from ego.
- **Time Safety Score**: 5
- **Overall Risk Score**: 5

#### Obstacle 3147.0:
- **Distance Risk Reason**: Well-separated in trajectory from the ego vehicle.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 5
- **Time Risk Reason**: Despite changes in velocity, it does not affect its interaction with the ego due to substantial distance.
- **Time Safety Score**: 5
- **Overall Risk Score**: 5

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
The analysis shows that all obstacles maintain paths and speeds that do not converge toward the ego vehicle. There are no indications for future collision based on their trajectories and speeds.

### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
    "CollisionObstacles": null,
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null,
    "ScenarioAnalysis": {
        "IsCollisionScenario": false,
        "Reasoning": "All obstacles remain on paths that do not interact with the ego vehicle, maintaining safe and separate trajectories with no indication of collision."
    }
}
```
This summary ensures complete safety for the ego vehicle at the recent timestep, with all obstacles posing no significant risk.
