Obstacle 3130 shows the highest longitudinal risk, as it is only 7.98 meters away longitudinally and closing at -4.62 m/s.  However, it's moving away laterally at 3.22 m/s to the left, lessening the immediate risk. Although it's approaching longitudinally, the lateral movement suggests it's likely to pass ahead of the ego vehicle without incident. No obstacle presents an immediate collision risk within the next timestep.
