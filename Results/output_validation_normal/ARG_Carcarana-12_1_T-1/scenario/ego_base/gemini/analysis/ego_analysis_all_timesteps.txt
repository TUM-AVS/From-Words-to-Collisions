At t=0.9s, obstacle 3130 is the closest to the ego vehicle, with a longitudinal distance of 7.98m and a lateral distance of 2.81 m. It's approaching the ego longitudinally (-4.62 m/s) and moving away laterally (3.22 m/s). While this obstacle is close, it is moving away laterally, reducing the immediate risk.  Obstacle 3140 is further away longitudinally (-13.56m) but its lateral distance is decreasing rapidly due to its high lateral velocity towards the ego (-7.30 m/s). This suggests a potential future risk, although not immediate. No obstacle poses an immediate collision risk within the next timestep.
