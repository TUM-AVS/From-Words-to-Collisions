### Safety analysis for timestep 0.9 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

**Assumptions and Clarifications:**

* Since the prompt emphasizes using *adjusted* distances (`adjusted_d_long`, `adjusted_d_lat`), and these values are not provided, I will proceed with the given `DTClong` and `DTClat`, assuming they already incorporate necessary adjustments for vehicle size.  It is *crucial* to provide these adjusted values for a realistic assessment in a real-world scenario.
* TTC will be approximated using distance and relative velocity.  Ideally, acceleration should also be considered for a more accurate TTC.  Since no ego vehicle motion is given, I assume it's stationary for TTC calculation simplicity. Negative TTC values indicate the objects are moving away.
* Lacking vehicle dimensions and precise trajectories, the risk assessment relies heavily on relative directions and motion descriptions.

### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 324**
- Distance Risk reason: Located rear-right with DTClong -10.51m and DTClat -10.51m, suggesting it's moving away.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason:  Moving away longitudinally (-8.40 m/s), lateral movement (1.10 m/s) not immediately concerning given the distance.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 350**
- Distance Risk reason: Located rear-right with DTClong -19.18m and DTClat -19.18m, clearly moving away.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Moving away longitudinally (-9.12 m/s),  lateral movement (0.69 m/s) not a concern given the large distance.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 3124**
- Distance Risk reason:  Located front-left with DTClong 19.35m and DTClat 19.35m.  Although moving closer longitudinally, lateral movement is away.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Approaching longitudinally (-4.04 m/s) but moving away laterally (3.59 m/s), the overall risk is reduced.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 3130**
- Distance Risk reason: Located front-left with DTClong 7.98m and DTClat 7.98m. Closer than 3124 and moving closer longitudinally.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason:  Approaching longitudinally (-4.62 m/s), lateral movement away (3.22 m/s) mitigates some risk.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3

- **Obstacle ID: 3140**
- Distance Risk reason: Located rear-left with DTClong -13.56m and DTClat -13.56m, indicating moving away.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Moving away longitudinally (-5.80 m/s). Lateral motion towards ego (-7.30 m/s) is significant but the distance is large enough.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4
