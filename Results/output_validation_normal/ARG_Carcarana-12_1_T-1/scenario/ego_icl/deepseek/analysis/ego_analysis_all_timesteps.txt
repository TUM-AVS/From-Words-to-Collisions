### Obstacle-by-Obstacle Analysis (Most Recent Timestep: 0.9s)

#### **Obstacle 324 (Rear-right)**
- **Adjusted Distance**: Longitudinal -10.51m, Lateral -9.73m  
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal -8.40 m/s (moving away), Lateral 1.10 m/s (approaching)  
- **Motion**: Moving away longitudinally but approaching laterally from the right.  
- **TTC (Lateral)**: 9.73m / 1.10 m/s = 8.85s (No Risk)  
- **MDC (Lateral)**: 9.73m (No Risk)  
- **Overall Risk**: 5 (No Risk)  
- **Justification**: Lateral distance is large and increasing slowly. Longitudinal distance is increasing rapidly.

#### **Obstacle 350 (Rear-right)**
- **Adjusted Distance**: Longitudinal -19.18m, Lateral -14.69m  
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal -9.12 m/s (moving away), Lateral 0.69 m/s (approaching)  
- **Motion**: Moving away longitudinally but approaching laterally from the right.  
- **TTC (Lateral)**: 14.69m / 0.69 m/s = 21.29s (No Risk)  
- **MDC (Lateral)**: 14.69m (No Risk)  
- **Overall Risk**: 5 (No Risk)  
- **Justification**: Lateral distance is very large and closing extremely slowly.

#### **Obstacle 3124 (Front-left)**
- **Adjusted Distance**: Longitudinal 19.35m, Lateral 9.29m  
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal -4.04 m/s (approaching), Lateral 3.59 m/s (moving away)  
- **Motion**: Approaching longitudinally but moving away laterally to the left.  
- **TTC (Longitudinal)**: 19.35m / 4.04 m/s = 4.79s (Low Risk)  
- **MDC (Longitudinal)**: 19.35m (No Risk)  
- **Overall Risk**: 4 (Low Risk)  
- **Justification**: Longitudinal distance is closing but still large. Lateral distance is increasing.

#### **Obstacle 3130 (Front-left)**
- **Adjusted Distance**: Longitudinal 7.98m, Lateral 2.81m  
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal -4.62 m/s (approaching), Lateral 3.22 m/s (moving away)  
- **Motion**: Approaching longitudinally but moving away laterally to the left.  
- **TTC (Longitudinal)**: 7.98m / 4.62 m/s = 1.73s (Medium Risk)  
- **MDC (Longitudinal)**: 7.98m (No Risk)  
- **Overall Risk**: 3 (Medium Risk)  
- **Justification**: Longitudinal distance is closing at a moderate rate, but lateral distance is increasing.

#### **Obstacle 3140 (Rear-left)**
- **Adjusted Distance**: Longitudinal -13.56m, Lateral 11.42m  
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal -5.80 m/s (moving away), Lateral -7.30 m/s (approaching)  
- **Motion**: Moving away longitudinally but approaching laterally from the left.  
- **TTC (Lateral)**: 11.42m / 7.30 m/s = 1.56s (Medium Risk)  
- **MDC (Lateral)**: 11.42m (No Risk)  
- **Overall Risk**: 3 (Medium Risk)  
- **Justification**: Lateral distance is closing rapidly, but longitudinal distance is increasing.  

---

### **Trajectory Analysis**
- **Obstacle 3130 (Front-left)**: Shows consistent longitudinal closing (~5m/s) but increasing lateral distance. Risk is medium due to longitudinal proximity.  
- **Obstacle 3140 (Rear-left)**: Lateral closing speed is high (7.3 m/s), but distance is still large.  
- **Other obstacles**: Either moving away or at safe distances.  

---

### **Final Determination**
- **No collisions (Risk 0) or extreme risks (Risk 1)** detected.  
- Highest risk is **Medium (Risk 3)** for Obstacles 3130 and 3140.
