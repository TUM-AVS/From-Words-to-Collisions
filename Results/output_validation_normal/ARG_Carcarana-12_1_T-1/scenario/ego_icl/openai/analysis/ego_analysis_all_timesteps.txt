### Obstacle-by-Obstacle Analysis

#### Obstacle 324 (Rear-right)

- **Trajectory Analysis**:
  - Initially in the right at 0.00m longitudinal, now at -10.51m and lateral movement is towards the ego.
  - The lateral distance is decreasing, suggesting convergence toward the path of the ego vehicle.
  
- **TTC and MDC**:
  - Adjusted distances indicate significant lateral separation but decreasing.
  - Longitudinal TTC = |-10.51| / |-8.40| ≈ 1.25 seconds (approaching).
  - Lateral movement indicates convergence, MDC = |lat_distance| ≈ 9.73m.
  
- **Risk Score**:
  - Longitudinal TTC suggests Medium Risk due to convergence.
  - MDC > 5.0 indicates No Risk, suggesting paths may not intersect imminently.
  - Final Risk: Medium Risk (3) due to the potential convergence path.

#### Obstacle 350 (Rear-right)

- **Trajectory Analysis**:
  - Initially in the right at 0.00m longitudinal, now at -19.18m with a lateral approach.
  
- **TTC and MDC**:
  - Longitudinal distance and relative velocity indicate a safe trajectory.
  - Lateral movement: Paths diverging, no imminent collision.
  - Both dimensions: Safe separation maintained.
  
- **Risk Score**:
  - TTC is relatively high, lateral separation sufficient.
  - Final Risk: No Risk (5).

#### Obstacle 3124 (Front-left)

- **Trajectory Analysis**:
  - Moving away laterally, initially in front-left.
  - Longitudinal distance increasing.
  
- **TTC and MDC**:
  - Longitudinal and lateral projections indicate diverging paths.
  - No imminent risk due to decreasing approach.
  
- **Risk Score**:
  - No Risk (5) as distances increase in both dimensions.

#### Obstacle 3130 (Front-left)

- **Trajectory Analysis**:
  - Consistently moving away in lateral dimension.
  - Longitudinal distance relatively stable, increasing slightly.
  
- **TTC and MDC**:
  - Both longitudinal and lateral separations are maintained.
  - No convergence is projected.
  
- **Risk Score**:
  - No Risk (5) due to stable divergence trend.

#### Obstacle 3140 (Rear-left)

- **Trajectory Analysis**:
  - Initially in rear-left at a divergent track.
  - Consistent lateral approach from the left.
  
- **TTC and MDC**:
  - Longitudinal distance increasing as paths diverge.
  - Lateral convergence, but sufficient distance remains.
  
- **Risk Score**:
  - Lateral separation increasing sufficiently.
  - Final Risk: Low Risk (4) due to initially close track; overall diverging.

### Collision Scenario Determination

None of the obstacles have a risk score of 0 or 1 based on current trajectories and separations. The risks aligned with predicted paths and motion descriptions indicate there are no imminent collision points, and diverging tendencies are clear.

### Conclusion
This is NOT a collision scenario. The closest case is Obstacle 324, which has a downward risk score of 3 but is not indicative of an imminent collision despite lateral convergence due to sufficient separation maintained.
