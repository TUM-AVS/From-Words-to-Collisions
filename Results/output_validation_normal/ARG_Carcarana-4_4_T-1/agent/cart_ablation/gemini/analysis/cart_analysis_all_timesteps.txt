Obstacle 3244 is in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle and initially relatively close (about 12.5 meters ahead).  While 3244's velocity is higher than the ego vehicle's, both are decelerating.  Obstacle 3244's deceleration is fluctuating but decreasing significantly, raising a slight concern that 3244 might not be decelerating consistently and might pose a risk if deceleration stops or the vehicle accelerates. Obstacle 3228 is in a neighboring lanelet and is moving slower than the ego vehicle and moving away from it. Therefore it is low risk. Obstacles 386 and 3221 are in different lanelets and far away from the ego vehicle, posing no immediate risk, while 3106 is relatively far away, so all of them are negligible risk. However, since there is no information regarding the lateral movement, it is assumed that all obstacles are travelling in a straight line and none will change lanelets.
