Obstacle 3244 is in the same lane as the ego vehicle and initially relatively close (around 12 meters apart at t=0.1s).  While 3244 is moving faster than the ego vehicle, both vehicles are decelerating. The distance between them decreases over the provided timeframe.  At t=0.9s, they are approximately 10 meters apart. Although a collision hasn't occurred yet, the closing distance and shared lanelet suggest a potential for collision if these trends continue. Obstacle 3228 is also in a lane next to the ego vehicle after t=0.6. However, the distance between obstacle 3228 and ego vehicle does not decrease continuously and therefore poses no immediate risk. Obstacles 386, 3221, and 3106 are in different lanelets and are not considered immediate risks. Focusing on obstacle 3244 based on the current trajectory and relative positions warrants elevated concern.
