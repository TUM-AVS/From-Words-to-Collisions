Here's the collision risk analysis for the provided scenario at t=0.9s:

**Ego Vehicle State at t=0.9s:**
* Position: (93.6142, -490.0823)
* Orientation: 2.858381767765943 radians
* Velocity: 7.87 m/s
* Acceleration: -0.1011 m/sÂ²

**Obstacles Analysis at t=0.9s:**

* **Obstacle 386.0:**
    * Position: (75.047259, -504.99314)
    * Distance to Ego: ~15.2 meters (predominantly lateral)
    * Velocity: 1.397622 m/s
    * Risk Assessment: Negligible risk. Obstacle 386 is relatively far from the ego vehicle, moving slowly, and poses no immediate threat.  Score: 5

* **Obstacle 3106.0:**
    * Position: (73.672946, -512.19849)
    * Distance to Ego: ~22.2 meters (predominantly lateral)
    * Velocity: 2.0888792 m/s
    * Risk Assessment: Negligible risk. Obstacle 3106 is far from the ego vehicle and its motion does not suggest a near-term collision risk. Score: 5

* **Obstacle 3221.0:**
    * Position: (70.754124, -485.3995)
    * Distance to Ego: ~23.9 meters (predominantly lateral)
    * Velocity: 8.4929818 m/s
    * Risk Assessment: Negligible risk. Despite the higher velocity, the considerable lateral separation suggests low risk. Score: 5

* **Obstacle 3228.0:**
    * Position: (84.711905, -488.3461)
    * Distance to Ego: ~9.05 meters (combination of longitudinal and lateral)
    * Velocity: 7.5490901 m/s
    * Risk Assessment: Low Risk. Although Obstacle 3228 is in the same general direction and is closer than others, the separation and trajectories suggest a low probability of collision given the current trends. Score: 4


* **Obstacle 3244.0:**
    * Position: (104.20172, -492.45241)
    * Distance to Ego: ~10.8 meters (predominantly longitudinal)
    * Velocity: 12.249197 m/s
    * Risk Assessment: Medium Risk.  Obstacle 3244 is in the same lane as the ego vehicle and is moving faster. The separation is moderate, but continued faster movement by Obstacle 3244 could rapidly increase risk. Score: 3


**Overall Assessment:**

No immediate collisions are predicted, but Obstacle 3244 requires monitoring due to its relative velocity and position in the same lane as the ego vehicle.
