At t=0.9s, the ego vehicle is in lanelet 7183. Let's analyze the risk posed by each obstacle:

* **Obstacle 386:** Located in lanelet 8098, far from the ego vehicle both laterally and longitudinally. Negligible risk.

* **Obstacle 3106:** Located in lanelet 6119, far from the ego vehicle. Negligible risk.

* **Obstacle 3221:** Located in lanelet 7113, also far from the ego vehicle. Negligible risk.

* **Obstacle 3228:** Located in the same lanelet (7183) as the ego vehicle.  The provided data doesn't give us precise lateral distances, but the Y-coordinates suggest they are close.  The ego vehicle's X-coordinate is 93.6142, while Obstacle 3228's is 84.7119, meaning it's behind the ego vehicle. Since both are moving in roughly the same direction (similar orientations), and obstacle 3228 is moving slower than the ego vehicle, the risk is low.

* **Obstacle 3244:** Located in lanelet 5612.  Although the lanelets are different, the Y-coordinates (-490.0823 for ego and -492.45241 for 3244) suggest proximity.  The X-coordinate of 3244 (104.20172) indicates it's ahead of the ego vehicle. Both vehicles have similar orientations. Obstacle 3244 is moving slightly faster than the ego. Needs further investigation, but currently poses a low risk.

Given the lack of precise lateral distances and a detailed lanelet map, we can only provide approximate risk assessments.  Further analysis with more precise data would be required for a definitive evaluation.
