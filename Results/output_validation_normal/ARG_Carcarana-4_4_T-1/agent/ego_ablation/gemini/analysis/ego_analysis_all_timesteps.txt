At t=0.9s, Obstacle 3228 is the most concerning. It's only 4.52m in front of the ego vehicle and closing, albeit slowly (-0.34 m/s longitudinal velocity).  While the lateral motion suggests the obstacle might be maneuvering, the close longitudinal proximity necessitates careful monitoring. Other obstacles are further away and pose less immediate risk.  Obstacle 3244 is approaching from behind and quite close (-6.32m) but not an immediate risk at this time.
