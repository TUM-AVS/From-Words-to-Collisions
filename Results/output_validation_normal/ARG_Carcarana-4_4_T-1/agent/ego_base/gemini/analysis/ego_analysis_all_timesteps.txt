Obstacle 386 is approaching the ego vehicle from the front-left, with a longitudinal distance of 9.15m and a lateral distance of 17.9m. Its relative velocity indicates it is moving towards the ego vehicle both longitudinally and laterally.  While it's closing in, there's still a reasonable distance, placing it potentially in the medium to high-risk category, depending on the speeds involved (which are not directly provided in relative velocity).

Obstacle 3106 is a new obstacle appearing in the last timestep. Similar to Obstacle 386, it's approaching from the front-left but with a shorter longitudinal distance of 8.46m and a larger lateral distance of 25.20m. It also exhibits relative velocity towards the ego vehicle in both directions. Given its shorter longitudinal distance, it warrants closer attention and could be categorized as a high risk.

Obstacle 3221 is moving away longitudinally from the ego vehicle, posing no immediate risk.

Obstacle 3228 is directly in front of the ego vehicle at a close longitudinal distance of 4.52m. Despite its slow relative longitudinal velocity, its proximity labels it as a high risk, potentially requiring immediate braking action.

Obstacle 3244 is approaching from behind, but its lateral movement is increasing, making its trajectory less predictable. While it's not an immediate threat, it requires monitoring and could be classified as a medium risk depending on its speed.

Based on the distances and the available information, Obstacle 3228 and 3106 present the most immediate concerns due to their proximity and closing distances, classifying them as high risk.
