### Safety analysis for timestep 0.9s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

It's important to note that the provided scenario lacks ego vehicle dimensions and adjusted distances (adjusted_d_long, adjusted_d_lat). This makes accurate TTC and MDC calculations impossible.  The analysis below is based on *relative* risk between obstacles, assuming similar sizes and using raw distances as a proxy for adjusted distances.  **Real-world autonomous driving requires the missing dimension information for robust safety assessments.**

**Assumptions (due to missing data):**

* Ego vehicle and obstacles have similar sizes.
* Raw distances (DTClong, DTClat) are used as approximations for adjusted distances.

### Obstacle Analysis:

**- Obstacle ID: 386**
- Distance Risk reason:  Relatively close in both longitudinal (9.15m) and lateral (9.15m) directions and approaching. Front-left position suggests a potential crossing trajectory.
- Distance safety score: 2 (High Risk)
- Time Risk reason: Without ego vehicle speed and accurate TTC calculation, the closing longitudinal and lateral velocities (-7.65 m/s, -1.38 m/s) suggest a medium-to-high risk.
- Time safety score: 2 (High Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 2 (High Risk)

**- Obstacle ID: 3106**
- Distance Risk reason: Closest obstacle in both longitudinal (8.46m) and lateral (8.46m) directions and approaching. Front-left position similar to 386 increases concern.
- Distance safety score: 2 (High Risk)
- Time Risk reason:  Closing velocities (-7.70 m/s, -2.08 m/s) combined with proximity raises the risk.
- Time safety score: 2 (High Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 2 (High Risk)

**- Obstacle ID: 3221**
- Distance Risk reason:  Furthest obstacle, and moving away longitudinally.  Lateral movement is slight.
- Distance safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
- Time Risk reason:  Moving away longitudinally reduces risk.
- Time safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 4 (Low Risk)

**- Obstacle ID: 3228**
- Distance Risk reason:  Close longitudinally (4.52m) and almost directly in front. Lateral velocity suggests it might be moving out of the ego vehicle's path.
- Distance safety score: 2 (High risk)
- Time Risk reason: Slow longitudinal closing velocity (-0.34 m/s) reduces immediate time risk, but still needs monitoring.
- Time safety score: 3 (Medium Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 3 (Medium Risk)


**- Obstacle ID: 3244**
- Distance Risk reason:  Approaching from behind (-6.32m) isn't as immediately concerning as obstacles in front, but the lateral motion and velocity suggest it might cut into the ego vehicle's lane.
- Distance safety score: 3 (Medium Risk)
- Time Risk reason: Closing velocity (4.34 m/s) from behind needs monitoring.
- Time safety score: 3 (Medium Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 3 (Medium Risk)
