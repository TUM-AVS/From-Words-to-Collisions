Let me analyze each obstacle at the most recent timestep (0.9 seconds):

1. Obstacle 386 (Front-left):
   - Adjusted distances: longitudinal 9.15m, lateral 17.90m
   - Relative velocities: longitudinal -7.65 m/s (approaching), lateral -1.38 m/s (approaching)
   - TTC_longitudinal = 9.15/7.65 = 1.20s
   - TTC_lateral = 17.90/1.38 = 12.97s
   - MDC: The smaller distance is longitudinal (9.15m)
   - Risk assessment: Medium risk (TTC_longitudinal < 3.0s, MDC > 5.0m)
   - Overall Risk: 3 (Medium)

2. Obstacle 3106 (Front-left):
   - Adjusted distances: longitudinal 8.46m, lateral 25.20m
   - Relative velocities: longitudinal -7.70 m/s, lateral -2.08 m/s
   - TTC_longitudinal = 8.46/7.70 = 1.10s
   - TTC_lateral = 25.20/2.08 = 12.12s
   - MDC: The smaller distance is longitudinal (8.46m)
   - Risk assessment: Medium risk (TTC_longitudinal < 3.0s, MDC > 5.0m)
   - Overall Risk: 3 (Medium)

3. Obstacle 3221 (Front-left):
   - Adjusted distances: longitudinal 18.75m, lateral 0.28m
   - Relative velocities: longitudinal 0.60 m/s (moving away), lateral 0.64 m/s (moving away)
   - TTC: Not applicable (moving away in both dimensions)
   - MDC: The smaller distance is lateral (0.28m) but increasing
   - Risk assessment: No risk (diverging paths)
   - Overall Risk: 5 (Negligible)

4. Obstacle 3228 (Front):
   - Adjusted distances: longitudinal 4.52m, lateral 0.00m
   - Relative velocities: longitudinal -0.34 m/s (approaching slowly), lateral 0.57 m/s (moving away)
   - TTC_longitudinal = 4.52/0.34 = 13.29s
   - TTC_lateral: Not applicable (moving away)
   - MDC: Longitudinal distance (4.52m)
   - Risk assessment: Low risk (MDC < 5.0m but TTC > 5.0s)
   - Overall Risk: 4 (Low)

5. Obstacle 3244 (Behind):
   - Adjusted distances: longitudinal -6.32m, lateral 0.00m
   - Relative velocities: longitudinal 4.34 m/s (approaching from behind), lateral 0.92 m/s (moving away)
   - TTC_longitudinal = 6.32/4.34 = 1.46s
   - TTC_lateral: Not applicable (moving away)
   - MDC: Longitudinal distance (6.32m)
   - Risk assessment: Medium risk (TTC_longitudinal < 3.0s, MDC > 5.0m)
   - Overall Risk: 3 (Medium)
