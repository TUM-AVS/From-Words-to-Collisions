At t=0.9s:

**Obstacle 386 (Front-Left):**

* Trajectory: Consistently front-left, approaching in both longitudinal and lateral directions.
* Longitudinal distance: 9.15m
* Lateral distance: 17.90m
* Longitudinal velocity: -7.65 m/s (approaching)
* Lateral velocity: -1.38 m/s (approaching)
* Longitudinal TTC: 9.15m / 7.65m/s = 1.20s
* Lateral TTC: 17.90m / 1.38m/s = 12.97s
* MDC: Not easily calculable without precise trajectory projections, but given the distances and TTCs, likely > 5m.
* Risk Assessment: Medium Risk (3) due to longitudinal TTC.

**Obstacle 3106 (Front-Left):**

* Trajectory: Newly appeared, front-left, approaching in both directions.
* Longitudinal distance: 8.46m
* Lateral distance: 25.20m
* Longitudinal velocity: -7.70 m/s (approaching)
* Lateral velocity: -2.08 m/s (approaching)
* Longitudinal TTC: 8.46m / 7.70m/s = 1.10s
* Lateral TTC: 25.20m / 2.08m/s = 12.12s
* MDC: Likely > 5m
* Risk Assessment: Medium Risk (3) due to longitudinal TTC.

**Obstacle 3221 (Front-Left):**

* Trajectory: Initially directly front and approaching, then transitioned slightly front-left and started moving away longitudinally, still slightly approaching laterally.
* Longitudinal distance: 18.75m
* Lateral distance: 0.28m
* Longitudinal velocity: 0.60 m/s (moving away)
* Lateral velocity: 0.64m/s (approaching)
* Longitudinal TTC: Not applicable due to diverging trajectory.
* Lateral TTC: 0.28 / 0.64 = 0.44s
* MDC: Approx 0.28m
* Risk Assessment: Extreme Risk (1) due to very low lateral TTC and MDC

**Obstacle 3228 (Front):**

* Trajectory: Consistently directly in front, slowly approaching longitudinally but slightly moving away laterally.
* Longitudinal distance: 4.52m
* Lateral distance: 0.00m
* Longitudinal velocity: -0.34 m/s (approaching)
* Lateral velocity: 0.57 m/s (moving away)
* Longitudinal TTC: 4.52m / 0.34 m/s = 13.29s 
* Lateral TTC: Not applicable as it's moving away laterally.
* MDC: Considering lateral alignment and slow longitudinal approach, MDC is approximately 4.52m.
* Risk Assessment: Low risk (4) due to MDC and longitudinal TTC.


**Obstacle 3244 (Behind):**

* Trajectory: Consistently behind, approaching longitudinally.
* Longitudinal distance: -6.32m (behind)
* Lateral distance: 0.00m
* Longitudinal velocity: 4.34 m/s (approaching)
* Lateral velocity: 0.92 m/s (approaching from right side)
* Longitudinal TTC: 6.32m / 4.34m/s = 1.46s
* MDC: Due to lateral alignment, MDC is primarily based on longitudinal distance and is approximately 6.32m.
* Risk Assessment: Medium Risk (3) due to longitudinal TTC.
