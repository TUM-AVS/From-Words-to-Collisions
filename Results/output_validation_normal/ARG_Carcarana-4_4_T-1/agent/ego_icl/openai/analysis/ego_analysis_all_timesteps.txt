Given the scenario context, let's analyze the obstacles in the most recent timestep (at 0.9 seconds):

### 1. Obstacle 386 (Front-left)
- **Position and Motion**:
  - Adjusted longitudinal distance: 9.15 m
  - Adjusted lateral distance: 17.90 m
  - Relative velocity: longitudinal -7.65 m/s, lateral -1.38 m/s
  - Motion: Driving toward the ego car longitudinally and laterally from the left.

- **Analysis**:
  - The obstacle is approaching both longitudinally and laterally.
  - **TTC Calculation**:
    - Longitudinal TTC = 9.15 / 7.65 ≈ 1.20 seconds
    - Lateral TTC = 17.90 / 1.38 ≈ 12.97 seconds
  - **MDC Calculation**:
    - As the obstacle is approaching diagonally, the smaller dimension is longitudinal.
    - The current minimum projected distance is around 9.15 m longitudinally, but this will decrease as it continues to approach.

- **Risk Assessment**: 
  - Medium Risk (3) based on TTC at approximately 1.20 seconds longitudinally, which is the more concerning dimension.

### 2. Obstacle 3106 (Front-left)
- **Position and Motion**:
  - Adjusted longitudinal distance: 8.46 m
  - Adjusted lateral distance: 25.20 m
  - Relative velocity: longitudinal -7.70 m/s, lateral -2.08 m/s
  - Motion: Driving toward the ego car longitudinally and laterally from the left.

- **Analysis**:
  - The obstacle is also approaching diagonally but is initially further away laterally.
  - **TTC Calculation**:
    - Longitudinal TTC = 8.46 / 7.70 ≈ 1.10 seconds
    - Lateral TTC = 25.20 / 2.08 ≈ 12.12 seconds
  - **MDC Calculation**:
    - Similar to obstacle 386, the longitudinal approach is more critical, with a future MDC becoming smaller.

- **Risk Assessment**:
  - Medium Risk (3) based on a longitudinal TTC of approximately 1.10 seconds.

### 3. Obstacle 3221 (Front)
- **Position and Motion**:
  - Adjusted longitudinal distance: 18.75 m
  - Adjusted lateral distance: 0.28 m
  - Relative velocity: longitudinal 0.60 m/s, lateral 0.64 m/s
  - Motion: Moving away longitudinally and laterally to the left.

- **Analysis**:
  - Obstacle moving away, with increasing distance in both dimensions.
  - **TTC Calculation**:
    - Since obstacle is moving away, no immediate collision risk.
  - **MDC Calculation**:
    - Increasing distance indicates negligible collision risk.

- **Risk Assessment**:
  - Negligible Risk (5), as it is diverging in both dimensions.

### 4. Obstacle 3228 (Front)
- **Position and Motion**:
  - Adjusted longitudinal distance: 4.52 m
  - Adjusted lateral distance: 0.00 m
  - Relative velocity: longitudinal -0.34 m/s
  - Motion: Driving toward the ego car longitudinally, exact lateral alignment.

- **Analysis**:
  - Obstacle moving towards ego vehicle, with small separation and slow approach.
  - **TTC Calculation**:
    - Longitudinal TTC = 4.52 / 0.34 ≈ 13.29 seconds (Long, thus indicating low urgency).
  - **MDC Calculation**:
    - Since alignment is constant and velocity low, the proximal risk is reduced over time.

- **Risk Assessment**:
  - Low Risk (4) given the small velocity and distance buffer.

### 5. Obstacle 3244 (Behind)
- **Position and Motion**:
  - Adjusted longitudinal distance: -6.32 m
  - Adjusted lateral distance: 0.00 m
  - Relative velocity: longitudinal 4.34 m/s
  - Motion: Driving toward the ego car from behind with exact lateral alignment.

- **Analysis**:
  - Catching up from behind, moderate closing speed.
  - **TTC Calculation**:
    - Longitudinal TTC ≈ 6.32 / 4.34 ≈ 1.46 seconds
  - **MDC Calculation**:
    - Approaching, but longitudinal space remains for immediate maneuver.

- **Risk Assessment**:
  - Medium Risk (3) due to fast approaching velocity from behind.
