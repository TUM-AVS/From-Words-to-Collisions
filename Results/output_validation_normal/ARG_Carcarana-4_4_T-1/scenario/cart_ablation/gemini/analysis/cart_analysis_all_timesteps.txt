At t=0.9s, Ego is in lanelet 7183.

Obstacle 386 is in lanelet 8098 and poses no immediate risk due to the large lateral distance.

Obstacle 3106 is in lanelet 6119 and poses no immediate risk due to the large lateral distance.

Obstacle 3221 is in lanelet 7113 and poses no immediate risk due to the lateral distance.

Obstacle 3228 is in the same lanelet 7183 as Ego.  Their positions are (93.6142, -490.0823) and (84.711905, -488.3461) respectively. Although the lateral distance is small, the longitudinal distance is significant enough that a collision is not imminent in the next second, given the current velocities. This is a medium risk (3).

Obstacle 3244 is in lanelet 5612 and poses no immediate risk given its location behind the ego vehicle.

Therefore, no obstacle presents a collision or extreme risk.
