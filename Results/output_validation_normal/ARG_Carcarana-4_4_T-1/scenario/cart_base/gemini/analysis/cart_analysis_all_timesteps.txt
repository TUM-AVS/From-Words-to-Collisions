At t=0.9s, Ego is in lanelet 7183.

* **Obstacle 3228:** This obstacle is also in lanelet 7183, posing a potential collision risk.  Ego's position is (93.6142, -490.0823) and Obstacle 3228's position is (84.711905, -488.3461).  The y-coordinates are close and the x-coordinates are converging. The velocities are similar but obstacle 3228 is decelerating more than the ego vehicle.  While not an immediate collision, the converging trajectories and proximity suggest an extreme risk.

* **Obstacle 3244:** This obstacle is in lanelet 5612. Ego was previously in this lanelet and has now changed to lanelet 7183. There is no immediate risk.

* **Obstacle 386:** Located in lanelet 8098.  No risk.

* **Obstacle 3106:** Located in lanelet 6119.  No risk.
