### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 386.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 386.0 is located in a different lanelet (8098.0) than the ego vehicle (7183.0) and maintains a significant lateral distance. Its trajectory over the past timesteps shows no indication of lane change or movement towards the ego vehicle's path.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: The obstacle's velocity and acceleration are low and consistent, posing no immediate threat in terms of time to collision.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 3106.0
- Distance Risk reason: This obstacle appears at the last timestep and is located in a different lanelet (6119.0). While more information is needed to fully assess its long-term behavior, its initial position suggests a negligible risk.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Similar to the distance risk, more data is required for a comprehensive time-based evaluation.  Given the initial conditions, the risk appears low.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 3221.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 3221.0 is in a different lanelet (7113.0) and consistently maintains a safe lateral distance. Its past trajectory reinforces this assessment.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason:  The velocity and acceleration of this obstacle suggest no imminent collision risk, further supported by the historical data.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 3228.0
- Distance Risk reason:  Obstacle 3228.0 is in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle (7183.0). While it is behind the ego vehicle, the distance is decreasing slightly over time. 
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: The obstacle's velocity is lower than the ego vehicle's, but the ego vehicle's velocity is also decreasing.  The historical trend suggests a potential catching-up scenario that requires monitoring but is not an immediate threat.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- Obstacle ID: 3244.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 3244.0 is in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle (5612.0, initially) and is located ahead. The distance between the ego vehicle and this obstacle is significant and increasing, as the ego vehicle slows down.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: The obstacle is moving faster than the ego vehicle and pulling away.  Historical data confirms this trend, minimizing time-related risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5


### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. **Most critical obstacles:** Obstacle 3228.0 requires the most attention as it is in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle and getting closer, although it is behind the ego vehicle.

2. **Trajectory Analysis:** Over the 10 timesteps, the ego vehicle starts in lanelet 5612.0 and transitions to lanelet 7183.0.  Obstacle 3228.0 remains in lanelet 7183.0 throughout the scenario. The ego vehicle is initially faster but decelerates over time, while 3228.0 maintains a relatively constant, slower velocity.

3. **Relative position, velocity, and acceleration:** The ego vehicle is ahead of 3228.0 and moving in the same direction. The relative velocity is initially large but decreases as the ego vehicle slows down. The relative acceleration suggests that the ego vehicle might be braking more significantly than 3228.0.

4. **Collision determination:** At the last time step (t=0.9s)  there is no collision. While 3228 is getting closer to the ego vehicle, there is still a sufficient safety gap.

5. **Reasoning:** While the distance between the ego vehicle and obstacle 3228.0 is decreasing, there is no immediate collision indicated in the provided data. The scenario requires careful monitoring, but it is not currently classified as a collision scenario.  The continued deceleration of the ego vehicle raises the possibility of a collision in the future if this trend continues.

        "Reasoning": "No collision is detected within the analyzed timesteps. While obstacle 3228.0 is getting closer to the ego vehicle as it is in the same lane and the ego is decelerating, there is still a safe distance between them at the last provided timestamp. Continued monitoring of the scenario is recommended due to the changing velocity dynamics."
