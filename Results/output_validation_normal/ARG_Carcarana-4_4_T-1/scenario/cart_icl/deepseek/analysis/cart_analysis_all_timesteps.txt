### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep (0.9 seconds):

### Obstacle Analysis:
1. **Obstacle ID: 386**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Located in lanelet 8098.0, far from ego's lanelet 7183.0. Distance is increasing over time.
   - **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: Moving away with low velocity (1.397622) and consistent acceleration.
   - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 5 (No risk)

2. **Obstacle ID: 3106**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Located in lanelet 6119.0, not in ego's path. Distance is stable.
   - **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: Low velocity (2.0888792) and negligible acceleration.
   - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 5 (No risk)

3. **Obstacle ID: 3221**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Located in lanelet 7113.0, adjacent to ego's lanelet 7183.0. Distance is decreasing but still significant.
   - **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: Velocity (8.4929818) is higher than ego's (7.87), but decelerating (-1.1311385). Relative velocity is low.
   - **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low Risk)

4. **Obstacle ID: 3228**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Located in lanelet 7183.0, same as ego. Distance is decreasing but still safe.
   - **Distance safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: Velocity (7.5490901) is slightly lower than ego's, but decelerating (-0.847646). Relative velocity is minimal.
   - **Time safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 3 (Medium Risk)

5. **Obstacle ID: 3244**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Located in lanelet 5612.0, ahead of ego. Distance is decreasing but still large.
   - **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: High velocity (12.249197) but moving away from ego. Deceleration (-0.28258) is minimal.
   - **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low Risk)

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. No obstacles are in immediate collision path (risk score 0).
2. Obstacle 3228 is in the same lanelet as ego but at a safe distance with minimal relative velocity.
3. All other obstacles are either in different lanelets or moving away.
4. No extreme risk (score 1) obstacles detected.
5. Scenario is non-collisional with manageable risks.
