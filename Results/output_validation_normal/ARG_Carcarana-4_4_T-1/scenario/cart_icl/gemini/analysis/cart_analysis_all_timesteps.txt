### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 332.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is far from ego vehicle and in a different lanelet.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason:  Relative velocity suggests no imminent risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 349.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is far from ego vehicle and in a different lanelet.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Obstacle is moving slowly and poses no immediate threat.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 386.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is moderately far from ego vehicle but in a different lanelet.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Obstacle's slow velocity and differing trajectory mitigate risk.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- Obstacle ID: 3106.0
- Distance Risk reason: Moderately far and in a different lanelet.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Slow velocity and different trajectory.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- Obstacle ID: 3203.0
- Distance Risk reason: Far from ego vehicle and in a different lanelet.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Relative velocity suggests no imminent risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 3213.0
- Distance Risk reason: Moderately far and in a different lanelet.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: While in a different lanelet, its trajectory should be monitored.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- Obstacle ID: 3221.0
- Distance Risk reason: Now in lanelet 7113, still some distance to the ego in 7183.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Trajectory and velocities suggest decreasing risk.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4


- Obstacle ID: 3228.0
- Distance Risk reason: In the same lanelet (7183) as ego but at a safe distance.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Both vehicles moving in the same general direction.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- Obstacle ID: 3244.0
- Distance Risk reason:  In the same lanelet, but sufficient distance behind ego.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Traveling faster than ego, requires monitoring.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3

- Obstacle ID: 3251.0
- Distance Risk reason: In the same lanelet and significantly ahead of ego.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Moving faster than ego and moving away.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
Based on the trajectories and relative velocities, there are no imminent collisions predicted. Obstacle 3244 needs continued monitoring due to higher speed in the same lane, but currently is not a major concern.

### Summary in JSON Format:
