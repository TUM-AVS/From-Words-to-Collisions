### Obstacle Analysis at the Most Recent Timestep (0.9 seconds):

#### Obstacle 332:
- **Distance Risk reason**: Obstacle 332 is significantly ahead and off lateral line of the ego vehicle, consistently moving away or parallel in direction. 
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: Stable velocity trend and no potential crossing paths with the ego. Past behavior indicates it's maintaining a safe trajectory.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

#### Obstacle 349:
- **Distance Risk reason**: Located in a different lane, maintaining consistent position away from ego's path.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: Low velocity with a slight increase, but orientation suggests it's not intercepting the ego trajectory.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

#### Obstacle 386:
- **Distance Risk reason**: Positioned behind the ego vehicle, moving at a low speed.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: Velocity and acceleration show minimal threat of catching up to the ego.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

#### Obstacle 3106:
- **Distance Risk reason**: Consistently behind and off the path of ego vehicle.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: Decreasing velocity indicating no danger of approaching the ego.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

#### Obstacle 3203:
- **Distance Risk reason**: Safe separation maintained throughout, located ahead but moving in a different pattern and velocity.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: Declining speed and alignment do not indicate a future encroachment.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

#### Obstacle 3213:
- **Distance Risk reason**: Safe distance and trajectory parallel but not converging with the ego.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: Decreased speed but maintaining direction aligned with historical patterns away from collision.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

#### Obstacle 3221:
- **Distance Risk reason**: Positioned optimally without intersecting the ego vehicle trajectory directly.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: Declining speed and non-conflicting path.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

#### Obstacle 3228:
- **Distance Risk reason**: Trajectory has never crossed that of the ego vehicle, maintaining a lateral separation.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: Deceleration indicates it is not approaching the ego.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

#### Obstacle 3244:
- **Distance Risk reason**: Moving ahead and parallel, far from the ego's trajectory.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: Consistent forward velocity without signs of lane changing or slowing dangerously.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

#### Obstacle 3251:
- **Distance Risk reason**: Leading further ahead with a similarly parallel trajectory, no conflict with ego's path.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: Acceleration does not suggest an impending lane approach or convergence.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
Throughout the examined period, there is no significant convergence towards a potential collision. Each obstacle maintains its path without intruding upon the ego vehicle's lane or projected travel path. Therefore, the scenario is not a collision scenario.
