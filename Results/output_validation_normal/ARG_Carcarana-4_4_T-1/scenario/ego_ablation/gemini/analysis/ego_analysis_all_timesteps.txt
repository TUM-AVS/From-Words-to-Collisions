Obstacle 3228 is at high risk of collision. It is only 4.52m in front of the ego vehicle and closing at -0.34 m/s. While the lateral relative velocity suggests it might be moving away laterally (0.57 m/s), the small longitudinal distance poses an immediate threat.

Obstacle 3244 also represents a high risk. Although behind the ego vehicle at -6.32m, it is approaching rapidly at 4.34 m/s.  The lateral velocity (0.92 m/s) suggests it might not be directly behind and could be on a collision course if the ego vehicle were to reverse or brake heavily.

Obstacle 386 is also concerning. At 9.15m ahead and approaching at -7.65m/s, it represents a substantial risk.  The lateral closing speed (-1.38 m/s) increases the risk.

Newly appearing obstacle 3106 is also a considerable risk at 8.46m ahead and approaching at -7.70 m/s with a lateral closing speed of -2.08 m/s. This obstacle warrants close monitoring.

    "IsCollisionScenario": false,
    "Reasoning": "Obstacle 3228 presents an extreme risk of collision due to its proximity to the ego vehicle (4.52m) and closing longitudinal velocity. While not a collision yet, immediate action is required to avoid impact. Other obstacles (386, 3106, 3244) present high risks."
