At t=0.9s, Obstacle 386 is at longitudinal distance 9.15m and lateral distance 17.90m, moving towards the ego vehicle both longitudinally and laterally. A new obstacle, Obstacle 3106, appears at longitudinal distance 8.46m and lateral distance 25.20m, also approaching the ego vehicle. Obstacle 3221 is moving away longitudinally and slightly to the left. Obstacle 3228 is at longitudinal distance 4.52m, moving towards the ego longitudinally but laterally away. Obstacle 3244 is behind the ego vehicle and moving closer.

Obstacle 386 and 3106 pose the highest risk due to their proximity and movement towards the ego vehicle. While 3228 is closest longitudinally, its lateral movement suggests it might be changing lanes. The other obstacles do not pose an immediate threat. Both 386 and 3106 require close monitoring for potential collision risk within the next few timesteps as they continue to approach the ego vehicle.  Since the longitudinal distances are decreasing and within a close range (~9m), these warrant a high-risk assessment, particularly 386 which is nearly directly ahead of the ego vehicle.

        "Reasoning": "Obstacle 386 poses an extreme risk due to its close proximity (9.15m longitudinal, 17.90m lateral) and its movement towards the ego vehicle both longitudinally and laterally at t=0.9s.  Obstacle 3106 also poses a high risk, although slightly further away.  No collision is imminent in the current timestep but 386 requires urgent attention."
