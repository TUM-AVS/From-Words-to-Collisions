### Safety analysis for timestep 0.9s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

**Assumptions and Clarifications:**

* Since the provided context lacks ego vehicle dimensions and adjusted distances (adjusted_d_long, adjusted_d_lat), I'll perform the analysis using the given *real* longitudinal and lateral distances (DTClong, DTClat).  **This analysis will therefore be less precise than one with adjusted distances.**  It is *crucial* to incorporate vehicle size for accurate TTC and MDC calculations in a real-world system.
* I'll assume a simplified TTC calculation: `TTC = Distance / Relative Velocity`.  A more sophisticated approach would consider acceleration and predict future trajectories.  This simplified version suffices for a basic risk assessment given the available data.  A negative relative velocity indicates the obstacle is moving towards the ego vehicle. 
* Because no ego vehicle speed is provided, I cannot determine if the ego vehicle is stationary or moving. I will infer relative risk based on the provided relative velocities and distances.


### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 386**
- Distance Risk reason:  Relatively close at 9.15m longitudinally and laterally, in the front-left, posing a potential risk.
- Distance safety score: 3 (Medium Risk)
- Time Risk reason: Approaching quickly longitudinally and laterally.
- Time safety score: 2 (High Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 2 (High Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 3106**
- Distance Risk reason:  Very close at 8.46m longitudinally and laterally in the front-left. This presents a significant risk.
- Distance safety score: 2 (High Risk)
- Time Risk reason: Approaching rapidly both longitudinally and laterally.
- Time safety score: 1 (Extreme Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 1 (Extreme Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 3221**
- Distance Risk reason:  Far away longitudinally and laterally in the front-left.
- Distance safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- Time Risk reason: Moving away longitudinally and laterally.
- Time safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 5 (Negligible Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 3228**
- Distance Risk reason:  Very close at 4.52m longitudinally and laterally, directly in front.  High risk of collision.
- Distance safety score: 1 (Extreme Risk)
- Time Risk reason: Approaching longitudinally but moving away laterally; however, longitudinal proximity is the dominant concern.
- Time safety score: 2 (High Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 1 (Extreme Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 3244**
- Distance Risk reason:  Moderately close at 6.32m behind.
- Distance safety score: 3 (Medium Risk)
- Time Risk reason: Approaching from behind.
- Time safety score: 2 (High Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 2 (High Risk)
