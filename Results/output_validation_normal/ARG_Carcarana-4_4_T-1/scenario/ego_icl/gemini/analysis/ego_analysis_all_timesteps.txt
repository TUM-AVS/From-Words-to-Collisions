* **Obstacle 386 (Front-Left):** This obstacle has been consistently approaching the ego vehicle both longitudinally and laterally across all timesteps.  At the last timestep (0.9s), it's at 9.15m longitudinally and 17.90m laterally. Assuming constant velocity, rough TTC estimates are 9.15m / 7.65m/s ≈ 1.2s (longitudinal) and 17.90m / 1.38m/s ≈ 13s (lateral).  MDC is difficult to determine precisely without projected paths, but given the closing distances in both dimensions, it's likely in the low to medium risk range. The risk is primarily longitudinal.

* **Obstacle 3106 (Front-Left):** This obstacle appears at the last timestep (0.9s) at 8.46m longitudinally and 25.20m laterally.  With relative velocities of -7.70 m/s and -2.08 m/s respectively, rough TTC estimates are 8.46m / 7.70m/s ≈ 1.1s (longitudinal) and 25.20m / 2.08m/s ≈ 12.1s (lateral). While the lateral distance is larger, the longitudinal distance and TTC suggest a higher risk.

* **Obstacle 3221 (Front/Front-Left):** Initially approaching longitudinally, this obstacle begins moving away from the ego vehicle after 0.1s. At 0.9s, it's at 18.75m longitudinally and 0.28m laterally. It appears to be slightly to the left. However, its motion indicates a diverging trajectory. With positive longitudinal velocity, the TTC longitudinally becomes less relevant, posing minimal risk. The small lateral distance is worth noting, but with the increasing longitudinal distance, the risk remains low. 

* **Obstacle 3228 (Front):** This obstacle remains almost directly in front of the ego vehicle, with a lateral distance consistently at 0.00m. At 0.9s, the longitudinal distance is 4.52m and closing, indicating potential risk despite the slow relative longitudinal velocity of -0.34 m/s. TTC is 4.52m / 0.34m/s ≈ 13.3s. Although the TTC appears high, the consistently small longitudinal distance and converging trajectory make this a higher risk situation than it appears numerically. MDC is likely around 0.5 meters or less given the near perfect alignment and closing distance.


* **Obstacle 3244 (Behind):** This obstacle is approaching from behind and is consistently aligned longitudinally (lateral distance at 0.00m). At 0.9s, it's at -6.32m longitudinally. It's closing relatively quickly with a velocity of 4.34 m/s.  TTC is 6.32m / 4.34m/s ≈ 1.5s. The risk is medium, requiring monitoring, but not immediately critical.

**Collision Scenario Determination:**

Obstacle 3228 poses the highest risk. While its TTC based purely on longitudinal distance and velocity seems high, its continuous near-zero lateral distance combined with a decreasing longitudinal distance points to a potential for collision shortly after the last timestep. The fact that the longitudinal distance has decreased consistently across all timesteps confirms a converging trajectory, indicating potential for an imminent collision within the next few timesteps if the trend continues. Therefore, this is assessed as a high-risk scenario demanding immediate attention and evasive action.
