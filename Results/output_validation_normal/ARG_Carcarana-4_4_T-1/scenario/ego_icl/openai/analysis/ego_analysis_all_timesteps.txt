### Detailed Analysis for Each Obstacle at the Most Recent Timestep (0.9 seconds):

#### Obstacle 386 (Front-left)
- **Current Adjusted Position**: Longitudinal 9.15m, Lateral 17.90m
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal -7.65 m/s, Lateral -1.38 m/s
- **Motion Description**: Driving toward the ego car both longitudinally and laterally from the left.
- **Trajectory Analysis**: Over several timesteps, this obstacle has been consistently reducing its longitudinal and lateral distances towards the ego vehicle.
- **TTC Calculation**: 
  - Longitudinal TTC = |Current Longitudinal Distance / Relative Longitudinal Velocity| = 9.15m / 7.65 m/s ≈ 1.20s
  - Lateral TTC = |Current Lateral Distance / Relative Lateral Velocity| = 17.90m / 1.38 m/s ≈ 12.97s

- **MDC Calculation**: As this obstacle approaches from the front-left with longitudinal and lateral reductions, the smaller projected position depends on closing distances in both dimensions. With a reduced current longitudinal distance, the weaker link is longitudinal trajectory, assuming direct intersection:
  - Based on current approach, MDC is primarily governed by lateral approach, given the longer time to collision longitudinally.

- **Risk Assessment**: 
  - Longitudinal TTC places this at high risk (score 2), given rapid reduction towards the ego vehicle.
  - Lateral analysis indicates no immediate threat with a risk score of 5.

- **Overall Risk Score**: Since TTC shows a higher risk in longitudinal movement, assign a score of 2.

#### Obstacle 3106 (Front-left)
- **Current Adjusted Position**: Longitudinal 8.46m, Lateral 25.20m
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal -7.70 m/s, Lateral -2.08 m/s
- **Motion Description**: Driving toward the ego car both longitudinally and laterally from the left.
- **Trajectory Analysis**: Consistently approaching from a diagonal trajectory.
- **TTC Calculation**: 
  - Longitudinal TTC = 8.46m / 7.70 m/s ≈ 1.10s
  - Lateral TTC = 25.20m / 2.08 m/s ≈ 12.12s

- **MDC Calculation**: Similar to obstacle 386, the crucial element is the rapid approach longitudinally within an acceptable margin.
  - Primary risk comes from a swift convergence along the longitudinal path with a lesser lateral threat given the existing lateral displacement.

- **Risk Assessment**: 
  - With a primary longitudinal threat, the high risk factor (score 2) is applicable given consistent trajectory closure.

- **Overall Risk Score**: 2 for high risk.

#### Obstacle 3221 (Front-left)
- **Current Adjusted Position**: Longitudinal 18.75m, Lateral 0.28m
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal 0.60 m/s, Moving away laterally
- **Motion Description**: Moving away longitudinally and laterally.
- **Trajectory Analysis**: Movement indicates no collision path.
- **TTC Calculation**: As the obstacle is moving away, TTC isn't defined for immediate collision.
- **MDC Calculation**: No converging trajectory.
- **Risk Assessment**: 
  - No observable risk with both dimensions diverging; hence, risk score is 5.

- **Overall Risk Score**: 5 for no risk.

#### Obstacle 3228 (Front-center)
- **Current Adjusted Position**: Longitudinal 4.52m, Lateral 0.00m
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal -0.34 m/s
- **Motion Description**: Driving toward the ego car longitudinally.
- **Trajectory Analysis**: Persistent static lateral alignment, converging in longitudinal dimension.
- **TTC Calculation**: Longitudinal TTC = 4.52m / 0.34 m/s ≈ 13.29s
- **MDC Calculation**: Directly within narrow range of the ego vehicle with decreasing longitudinal path, but lateral path maintains.
- **Risk Assessment**: 
  - Primary risk lies in decreasing longitudinal distance; however, significant longitudinal gain is required rapidly due to velocity averaging.
  - Relatively low risk (score 4) due to slowly closing distance.

- **Overall Risk Score**: 4 for low risk.

#### Obstacle 3244 (Behind)
- **Current Adjusted Position**: Longitudinal -6.32m, Lateral 0.00m
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal 4.34 m/s
- **Motion Description**: Driving toward the ego vehicle from behind.
- **Trajectory Analysis**: Gradual approach from behind with increasing velocity.
- **TTC Calculation**: Longitudinal reverse positioning and relative speed calls for a longer forward span despite negativity when extrapolating standard longitudinal path.
- **MDC Calculation**: Primary concern remains upcoming path closing due to the enhanced rate.
- **Risk Assessment**: 
  - Given non-negative output during shared analysis, medium risk (score 3), with emphasis on regular tracking required.

- **Overall Risk Score**: 3 for medium risk.

### Conclusion:

- **Obstacle 386 and Obstacle 3106** represent the highest identified risk.
- **Neither reach collision status**, though both indicate high risk necessitating timely evasive action to avert potential collisions.

### Summary of Collision Risk:
```json
{
    "CollisionObstacle": null,
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null,
    "IsCollisionScenario": false,
    "Justification": "All obstacles are assessed to be higher than the extreme risk threshold with risk scores ranging from 2 (high risk) to 5 (no risk). No immediate collision imminent as compared across distances."
}
```
Overall, the scenario incorporates a non-colliding but cautionary setting involving primarily diagonal convergence requiring routine trajectory assessment and potential inhibitory response.
