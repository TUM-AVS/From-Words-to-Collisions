Obstacle 326 is in the same lane as the ego vehicle (lanelet 20492) starting at t=0.5s.  Both are traveling in roughly the same direction, but 326 has a significantly higher velocity and is closing the distance to the ego vehicle. Though there isn't an immediate collision in the provided timeframe, the closing velocities and shared lanelet make a near-term collision likely if obstacle 326 does not decelerate or the ego vehicle does not accelerate/maneuver.
