Obstacle 326 is in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle at t=0.5s and subsequent timesteps.  The y-coordinates show obstacle 326 is ahead of the ego vehicle, and closing. The x-coordinates also suggest possible collision. This obstacle represents at least a high risk, possibly extreme risk, given its proximity and the closing speeds. Other obstacles are in different lanelets and are unlikely to interact with the ego vehicle within the given timeframe.
