At t=0.9s, the ego vehicle is at (-625.8562, -247.8719) and moving with a velocity of 10.0966 and a slight deceleration.  Let's analyze the risk posed by each obstacle:

* **Obstacle 32:** Position (-621.52196, -254.29576). Stationary.  Poses no immediate threat. Negligible Risk (5).

* **Obstacle 310:** Position (-621.07975, -261.78637).  Moving very slowly. No immediate threat. Negligible Risk (5).

* **Obstacle 318:** Position (-620.60019, -269.52531).  Moving slowly and decelerating.  Far from ego vehicle path. Negligible Risk (5).

* **Obstacle 326:** Position (-624.51062, -268.35162). Moving with a velocity of 8.255409 and slight acceleration in lanelet 20492.0, same as ego vehicle is located. The y-coordinate difference is significant, and both are in the same lanelet. Therefore, MDC is decreasing quickly, indicating a High Risk. MDC is approximately sqrt((-625.8562 + 624.51062)^2 + (-247.8719 + 268.35162)^2) = 20.49.  High Risk (2).

* **Obstacle 332:** Position (-621.96382, -246.80526). Stationary. Relatively close to the ego vehicle in y-coordinate, but the x-coordinate difference suggests no immediate danger. Low Risk (4).


Based on the provided data, obstacle 326 represents the highest risk due to its proximity, similar lanelet occupancy, and differing velocities although current MDC is relatively large which is 20.49. While not an immediate collision, the situation requires careful monitoring. The next timestep is likely to bring their y-coordinates closer. Obstacle 332 poses a low risk but also requires monitoring given its relative proximity.
