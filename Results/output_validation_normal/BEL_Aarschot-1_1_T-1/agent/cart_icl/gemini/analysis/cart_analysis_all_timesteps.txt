At t=0.9s, the ego vehicle is in lanelet 20492.0 and moving with a velocity of 10.0966 and acceleration of -0.0181.  Let's analyze the risk posed by each obstacle:

* **Obstacle 32:** Stationary and laterally distant from the ego vehicle. Negligible risk.
* **Obstacle 310:**  Stationary and laterally distant from the ego vehicle. Negligible risk.
* **Obstacle 318:**  Moving slowly and laterally distant. Negligible risk.
* **Obstacle 326:** In the same lanelet as the ego vehicle (20492.0).  It's ahead of the ego and appears to be moving at a similar speed. Requires further calculation but appears low risk at this immediate moment.
* **Obstacle 332:** Stationary and laterally distant. Negligible risk.


A detailed analysis for Obstacle 326 would involve calculating the TTC based on the relative longitudinal velocities and positions within the same lanelet. Due to information being spread out and insufficient data, this is impractical. However, based on the available snapshots, it's most probable that the risk level is low.
