### Analysis

At the latest timestamp (0.9 seconds), an analysis of the Ego vehicle and all obstacles was performed. Here are the key findings:

1. **Obstacle 32**:
   - **Position**: (-621.52196, -254.29576)
   - **Velocity**: 0 m/s (stationary)
   - **Relative Position to Ego**: The obstacle is positioned about 7.35 meters perpendicular to the direction of ego’s travel path.
   - **Risk**: The obstacle is stationary and located outside the direct path of the Ego vehicle. **Negligible Risk (5)**

2. **Obstacle 310**:
   - **Position**: (-621.07975, -261.78637)
   - **Velocity**: ~0.00015 m/s
   - **Relative Position to Ego**: Located quite far behind the ego vehicle in a different lane. 
   - **Risk**: No immediate collision trajectory. **Negligible Risk (5)**

3. **Obstacle 318**:
   - **Position**: (-620.60019, -269.52531)
   - **Velocity**: ~0.277 m/s
   - **Relative Position to Ego**: Outside the Ego's lane and at a significant distance.
   - **Risk**: No significant risk as it does not intersect with Ego’s trajectory. **Negligible Risk (5)**

4. **Obstacle 326**:
   - **Position**: (-624.51062, -268.35162)
   - **Velocity**: ~8.26 m/s 
   - **Relative Position to Ego**: Despite being faster and in the same lanelet, the obstacle is behind the Ego and moving in the opposite direction.
   - **Risk**: Obstacle is moving away and in separate lanes over time. **Low Risk (4)**

5. **Obstacle 332**:
   - **Position**: (-621.96382, -246.80526)
   - **Velocity**: 0 m/s (stationary)
   - **Relative Position to Ego**: Far from the current trajectory of the Ego vehicle.
   - **Risk**: No collision risk due to stationary state and distance. **Negligible Risk (5)**

### Conclusion
All obstacles show no immediate risk to the Ego as they are either stationary or have a trajectory that does not pose a direct threat. The overall motion trends and safe distances maintained suggest that the Ego is operating in a stable environment without collision threats at this time.
