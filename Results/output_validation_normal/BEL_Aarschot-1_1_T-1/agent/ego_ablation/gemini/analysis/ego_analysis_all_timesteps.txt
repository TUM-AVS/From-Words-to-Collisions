At t=0.9s, Obstacle 32 is at a longitudinal distance of 1.95m and lateral distance of 2.68m, with a longitudinal velocity of -10.10 m/s moving towards the ego vehicle. This is extremely close and represents an **Extreme Risk** of collision.

Obstacle 310 is at longitudinal distance of 9.44m and lateral distance of 3.07m, and approaching with longitudinal velocity -10.10 m/s.  While not as immediately dangerous as Obstacle 32, this represents a **High Risk**.

Obstacle 318 (17.18m longitudinal, 3.49m lateral) and Obstacle 326 (15.98m longitudinal, 0.00m lateral) are further away but still closing. Obstacle 326 is directly in front of the ego vehicle, though its relatively slow longitudinal velocity of -1.85 m/s may provide more time to react.  These obstacles present **Medium Risk**.


Obstacle 332 is at 0.00m longitudinal and 2.29m lateral distance, meaning it is alongside the ego vehicle. However, since the relative longitudinal velocity is -10.10 m/s and lateral motion is minimal, this suggests it might be in an adjacent lane moving at a similar speed and not an immediate threat. Its considered **Low Risk**  since there's no immediate danger of a collision, although the close proximity warrants monitoring.
