### Safety analysis for timestep 0.9s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

**- Obstacle ID: 32**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 32 is very close (1.95m longitudinally and laterally) and approaching the ego vehicle.
- Distance safety score: 1
- Time Risk reason: Given the relative velocity and distance, a collision is imminent if no action is taken.
- Time safety score: 1
- Overall Risk score: 1

**- Obstacle ID: 310**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 310 is at a moderate distance (9.44m longitudinally and laterally), but still approaching the ego vehicle.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: While there is some time to react, the closing speed suggests a potential hazard if no evasive maneuvers are performed.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3

**- Obstacle ID: 318**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 318 is at a safe distance (17.18m longitudinally and laterally).
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: The relative velocity is considerable, but there is enough time to react and avoid a collision.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

**- Obstacle ID: 326**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 326 is at a safe distance (15.98m longitudinally and laterally).
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason:  The relative velocity is relatively low and the distance is sufficient to provide ample reaction time.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

**- Obstacle ID: 332**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 332 has collided with the ego vehicle (0.0m both longitudinally and laterally).
- Distance safety score: 0
- Time Risk reason: Collision is happening at this timestep.
- Time safety score: 0
- Overall Risk score: 0
