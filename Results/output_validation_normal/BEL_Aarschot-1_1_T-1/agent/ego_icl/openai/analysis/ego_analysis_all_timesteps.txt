To assess the collision risks based on the given scenario context at the most recent timestep (0.9 seconds), we will analyze each obstacle in terms of their trajectories, relevant distances and velocities, as well as calculated Time-to-Collision (TTC) and Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC).

### Obstacle by Obstacle Analysis

#### Obstacle 32:
- **Position**: Front-left of the ego vehicle
- **Adjusted Distances**: Longitudinal 1.95m, Lateral 2.68m
- **Velocities**: Longitudinal velocity -10.10 m/s
- **Motion**: Obstacle is driving toward the ego car longitudinally, no lateral relative motion.

#### Trajectory Analysis:
- Consistently moving towards the ego vehicle with a closing longitudinal velocity.
- Lateral distance relatively stable.

#### Calculations:
- **TTC (Longitudinal)**: 1.95 m / 10.10 m/s ≈ 0.19 seconds
- **MDC**: Longitudinal distance is the critical one due to frontal approach; currently at 1.95m.

#### Risk Assessment:
- TTC < 0.5s indicates **Extreme Risk**.
- Risk Score: **1**

----

#### Obstacle 310:
- **Position**: Front-left of the ego vehicle
- **Adjusted Distances**: Longitudinal 9.44m, Lateral 3.07m
- **Velocities**: Longitudinal velocity -10.10 m/s
- **Motion**: Obstacle is driving toward the ego car longitudinally, also moving laterally toward the ego car.

#### Trajectory Analysis:
- Approaching with significant longitudinal velocity; lateral movement towards the ego vehicle.

#### Calculations:
- **TTC (Longitudinal)**: 9.44m / 10.10 m/s ≈ 0.93 seconds
- **MDC**: Smaller component due to frontal approach, at 9.44m.

#### Risk Assessment:
- 0.5 < TTC ≤ 1.0s indicates **High Risk**.
- Risk Score: **2**

----

#### Obstacle 318:
- **Position**: Front-left
- **Adjusted Distances**: Longitudinal 17.18m, Lateral 3.49m
- **Velocities**: Longitudinal velocity -10.37 m/s
- **Motion**: Moving toward the ego vehicle both longitudinally and laterally.

#### Trajectory Analysis:
- Both longitudinal and lateral distances decreasing.

#### Calculations:
- **TTC (Longitudinal)**: 17.18m / 10.37 m/s ≈ 1.66 seconds
- **MDC**: 17.18m (longitudinal is critical).

#### Risk Assessment:
- TTC between 1.0s and 3.0s indicates **Medium Risk**.
- Risk Score: **3**

----

#### Obstacle 326:
- **Position**: Front
- **Adjusted Distances**: Longitudinal 15.98m, Lateral 0.00m
- **Velocities**: Longitudinal velocity -1.85 m/s
- **Motion**: Exact lateral alignment.

#### Trajectory Analysis:
- Longitudinal approach with negligible lateral motion.

#### Calculations:
- **TTC (Longitudinal)**: 15.98m / 1.85 m/s ≈ 8.64 seconds (far greater risk due to low closing speed).
- **MDC**: Longitudinal critical, at 15.98m.

#### Risk Assessment:
- TTC > 5.0s; **Negligible Risk**.
- Risk Score: **5**

----

#### Obstacle 332:
- **Position**: Left of the ego car
- **Adjusted Distances**: Longitudinal 0.00m, Lateral 2.29m
- **Velocities**: Longitudinal velocity -10.10 m/s
- **Motion**: Exact longitudinal alignment.

#### Trajectory Analysis:
- Stationary relative to lateral motion.

#### Calculations:
- **TTC (Lateral)**: Not relevant due to existing lateral separation.
- **MDC**: Same as lateral distance since longitudinal is aligned; 2.29m.

#### Risk Assessment:
- Lateral separation implies more time to react; **Low Risk**.
- Risk Score: **4**
