At t=0.9s, Ego is in lanelet 20492.0 and moving with a velocity of 10.0966.

Obstacle 326 is also in the same lanelet (20492.0) and moving with a velocity of 8.255409.  The positions of Ego (-625.8562, -247.8719) and Obstacle 326 (-624.51062, -268.35162) indicate a potential collision risk as they are in the same lane and Obstacle 326 is behind Ego but closing in. Further calculations considering their relative velocity and the minimal y-distance difference suggest a high risk of collision in the coming steps if the current trajectories continue. Though not an *extreme* risk at this precise moment, it merits a high risk score due to the rapid approach and same-lane occupancy.

        "IsCollisionScenario": false,
        "Reasoning": "Obstacle 326 poses a high collision risk in the same lanelet as Ego, approaching rapidly from behind.  While not an immediate collision at t=0.9s, the trajectories suggest a very high likelihood of collision in the next few timesteps."
