At t=0.9s, Ego is in lanelet 20492.0 and moving with a velocity of 10.0966 and acceleration of -0.0181.

Obstacle 326 is also in the same lanelet (20492.0) and moving with a velocity of 8.255409 and acceleration of 0.110901.  The positions of Ego (-625.8562, -247.8719) and Obstacle 326 (-624.51062, -268.35162) indicate a potential for collision.  While Obstacle 326 is currently behind Ego, its acceleration is positive while Ego's is slightly negative.  The y-coordinate difference is also relatively small. This converging behavior combined with the lane sharing indicates a high risk of collision within the next few timesteps, if not already by the next timestep. Thus, Obstacle 326 represents an extreme risk.

Other obstacles are in different lanelets and do not pose an immediate threat.
