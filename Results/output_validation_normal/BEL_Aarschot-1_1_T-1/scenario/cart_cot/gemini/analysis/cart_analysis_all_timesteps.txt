### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 32
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 32 is located in a different lanelet and poses no immediate threat. Its position has remained constant throughout the scenario.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: The obstacle is stationary, eliminating any time-related risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 310
- Distance Risk reason:  Located in a different lanelet and far from the ego vehicle. No risk observed from its trajectory.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason:  While moving, its very slow speed and the distance involved mitigate any time-related risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 318
- Distance Risk reason: Located in a different lanelet and far from the ego vehicle's trajectory. No risk observed.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason:  While the obstacle is moving, its trajectory does not intersect with the ego vehicle's path, thus posing no time-related risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 326
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 326 is in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle at the last timestep and relatively close. The trajectories over time show the ego vehicle approaching this obstacle. 
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: Both vehicles are moving in the same general direction, but the ego vehicle's faster speed indicates a potential risk if obstacle 326 maintains its current speed or decelerates.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3

- Obstacle ID: 332
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 332 is located in a different lanelet and poses no immediate threat. Its position has remained constant throughout the scenario.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: The obstacle is stationary, eliminating any time-related risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5



### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. **Most critical obstacle:** Obstacle 326 is the most critical as it shares the same lanelet as the ego vehicle at the final timestep and is relatively close.

2. **Trajectory analysis:** Over the 10 timesteps, the ego vehicle enters the same lanelet as obstacle 326 and continues to approach it. Obstacle 326 shows slight variations in acceleration.

3. **Relative position, velocity, and acceleration:**  The ego vehicle is moving faster than obstacle 326. The relative positions indicate closing distance while the similar orientations and lanelets raise concern.

4. **Collision determination:** No collision has occurred within the observed time frame. However, based on current trajectories and speeds, there is a medium risk of a future collision unless one of the vehicles adjusts its speed or trajectory.

5. **Reasoning:** Although a collision is not imminent, the closing distance between the ego vehicle and obstacle 326, coupled with their lanelet positions, indicates a medium risk level requiring attention. Other obstacles remain far and in different lanelets, not posing an immediate threat.


### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
  "CollisionObstacles": null,
  "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null,
  "ScenarioAnalysis": {
    "IsCollisionScenario": false,
    "Reasoning": "No collision has occurred within the observed time frame. Obstacle 326 poses a medium risk due to its proximity and shared lanelet with the ego vehicle at the last timestep, requiring attention to prevent a potential future collision. All other obstacles are assessed as low or no risk."
