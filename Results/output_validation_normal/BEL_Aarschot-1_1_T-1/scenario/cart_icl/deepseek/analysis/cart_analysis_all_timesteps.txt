### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep (0.9 seconds):

### Obstacle Analysis:
1. **Obstacle ID: 32.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Static obstacle (velocity ~0), located at (-621.52196, -254.29576). Distance to ego (~4.3m laterally, ~6.4m longitudinally) is stable over time.
   - **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: No relative motion (static). No TTC concern.
   - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low Risk)

2. **Obstacle ID: 310.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Nearly static (velocity ~0.00015 m/s), located at (-621.07975, -261.78637). Distance to ego (~4.8m laterally, ~13.9m longitudinally) is increasing slightly.
   - **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: Minimal relative motion. No TTC concern.
   - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)

3. **Obstacle ID: 318.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Moving slowly (~0.277 m/s) away from ego, located at (-620.60019, -269.52531). Distance to ego (~5.3m laterally, ~21.7m longitudinally) is increasing.
   - **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: Moving away. No TTC concern.
   - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)

4. **Obstacle ID: 326.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Moving parallel to ego (~8.26 m/s) in adjacent lanelet (20492.0). Distance to ego (~1.3m laterally, ~20.5m longitudinally) is stable.
   - **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: Similar velocity to ego (~10.1 m/s). No convergence in trajectories.
   - **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low Risk)

5. **Obstacle ID: 332.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Static obstacle (velocity = 0), located at (-621.96382, -246.80526). Distance to ego (~3.6m laterally, ~3.1m longitudinally) is stable.
   - **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: No relative motion. No TTC concern.
   - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low Risk)

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. **Ego Vehicle**: Moving at ~10.1 m/s with minor deceleration. Lane change occurred at ~0.5s (lanelet 20831.0 â†’ 20492.0).
2. **Obstacle Trajectories**: All obstacles are either static or moving away from ego. No convergence in paths observed.
3. **Critical Obstacle**: None. Closest obstacle (326.0) is in adjacent lanelet with parallel motion.
4. **Conclusion**: No collision risk detected.
