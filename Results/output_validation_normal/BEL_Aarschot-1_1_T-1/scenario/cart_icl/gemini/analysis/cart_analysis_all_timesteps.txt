- Time Risk reason: Lateral velocity difference minimal. Longitudinal velocity difference is significant.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5
- Obstacle ID: 32.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is relatively close but not on a direct collision course.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Obstacle is stationary. Ego vehicle is moving away.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 4
- Obstacle ID: 310.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is relatively close but not on a direct collision course.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Obstacle is almost stationary and moving slowly away from ego vehicle.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 4
- Obstacle ID: 318.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is close to ego vehicle's trajectory and poses a potential risk.

- Overall Risk score: 5
- Obstacle ID: 326.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is in the same lanelet and close behind the ego vehicle.
- Distance safety score: 2
- Time Risk reason: Obstacle is moving at a similar speed to ego vehicle. Small closing velocity
- Time safety score: 2
- Overall Risk score: 2
- Obstacle ID: 332.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is relatively close but not on a collision course.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Obstacle is stationary. No risk from relative velocity.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 4
- Obstacle ID: 335.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is far from ego vehicle. No immediate risk.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason:  Lateral velocity difference minimal. Longitudinal velocity difference is significant.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
No immediate collision in the current timestep. Obstacle 326 is closest and poses the highest risk due to proximity and similar speed to the ego vehicle. Obstacle 318 also needs to be monitored. Others not on collision course.

### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
  "CollisionObstacles": null,
  "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null,
  "ScenarioAnalysis": {
    "IsCollisionScenario": false,
    "Reasoning": "No obstacle has a risk score of 0. Closest obstacle (326) has a risk score of 2, requiring attention but not indicating immediate collision. Obstacle 318 poses a medium risk (score 3)."
  }
}
