### Obstacle Analysis:

#### Obstacle ID: 31.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: This obstacle, located in lanelet 20644.0, is far from the ego vehicle's position in lanelet 20492.0. It has been consistently moving away from the ego vehicle.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: With a low and consistent velocity, slight acceleration, and opposite orientation, it presents no immediate risk. Its trajectory shows a steady increase in distance from the ego vehicle.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 32.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: Stationary for all timesteps within lanelet 20493.0, it's not in the collision path of the ego vehicle, which is progressing in neighboring lanelets.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: Without any significant velocity or acceleration, the obstacle remains in a negligible collision trajectory.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 310.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: Similarly stationary as Obstacle 32.0, positioned in lanelet 20493.0, it remains outside of any potential collision path with the ego vehicle.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: Remains with negligible movement throughout the scenario.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 318.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: Located in lanelet 20493.0, its trajectory and speed gradually decrease. It remains distanced from the ego vehicle's path.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: Exhibiting deceleration, it does not pose a risk of collision.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 320.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: Static presence in lanelet 20646.0 with no movement or change in position.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: Absence of any velocity maintains no temporal collision risk.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 326.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: Positioned within lanelet 20492.0 along ego's future path, though primarily moving straight in its own lane.
- **Distance safety score**: 4
- **Time Risk reason**: Maintains relatively high speed but with decreasing acceleration, suggesting no imminent risk if maneuvered around.
- **Time safety score**: 4
- **Overall Risk score**: 4

#### Obstacle ID: 332.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: Stationary with no positional change in lanelet 20493.0.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: Lack of movement precludes any immediate risk.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 335.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: Moving away from ego with gradual increase in speed through the scenario within lanelet 20644.0.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: Continuous acceleration away from the ego vehicle reduces any temporal risk.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
The analysis indicates the scenario is not a collision scenario. Obstacle 326.0, while in the future lanelet of the ego, maintains a parallel trajectory and has a sufficient gap, thus not requiring an immediate evasive action. Other obstacles either remain stationary or are progressively distancing from the ego vehicle.
