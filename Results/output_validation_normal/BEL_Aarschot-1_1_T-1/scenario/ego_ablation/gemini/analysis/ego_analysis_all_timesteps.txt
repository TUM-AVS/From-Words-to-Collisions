Obstacle 32 is at high risk of collision with the ego vehicle.  It is only 1.95 meters away longitudinally and closing at a high relative velocity (-10.10 m/s). While lateral movement is minimal, the longitudinal proximity and speed create an imminent collision risk.

    "IsCollisionScenario": false,
    "Reasoning": "Obstacle 32 poses an extreme risk with a very high likelihood of collision in the next timestep due to its close longitudinal proximity (1.95m) and high closing velocity (-10.10 m/s)."
