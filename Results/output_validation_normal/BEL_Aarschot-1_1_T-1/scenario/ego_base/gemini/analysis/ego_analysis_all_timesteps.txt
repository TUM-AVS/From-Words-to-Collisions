        "ObstacleID": "32",
        "OverallRiskScore": 1
    },
    "ScenarioAnalysis": {
        "IsCollisionScenario": false,
        "Reasoning": "Obstacle 32 poses an extreme risk as it is very close and approaching rapidly, indicating a likely collision in the next timestep.  However, a collision hasn't occurred yet, thus IsCollisionScenario is false."
    }
