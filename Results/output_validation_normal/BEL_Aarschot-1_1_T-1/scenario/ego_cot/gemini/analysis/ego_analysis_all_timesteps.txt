### Safety analysis for timestep 0.9 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

**Assumptions and Clarifications:**

* Since "adjusted distances" are not provided in the scenario context, the provided real distances (DTClong and DTClat) will be used for this analysis.  This will likely lead to a *less accurate* assessment.  Providing adjusted distances is crucial for realistic evaluation.
* TTC is calculated as distance / relative velocity. If relative velocity is zero or away from the ego vehicle, TTC is considered infinite (represented as "inf").
* I'll assume a collision occurs if the distance in either direction is less than a threshold (I'll use 0.5m for this example -  adjust as needed based on vehicle dimensions).

### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 32**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is extremely close (1.95m longitudinally and laterally) and in the front-left of the ego vehicle.
- Distance safety score: 1 (Extreme Risk)
- Time Risk reason: Approaching very rapidly longitudinally (-10.10 m/s) and close to collision.  
- Time safety score: 1 (Extreme Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 1 (Extreme Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 310**
- Distance Risk reason: Relatively close (9.44m longitudinally and laterally) and approaching in the front-left of the ego vehicle.
- Distance safety score: 2 (High Risk)
- Time Risk reason: Approaching at -10.10 m/s longitudinally.  
- Time safety score: 2 (High Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 2 (High Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 318**
- Distance Risk reason:  Further away (17.18m longitudinally and laterally) in the front-left.
- Distance safety score: 3 (Medium Risk)
- Time Risk reason:  Approaching at -10.37 m/s longitudinally.
- Time safety score: 2 (High Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 2 (High Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 326**
- Distance Risk reason:  Relatively far (15.98m longitudinally and laterally) in the front. Moving slightly closer longitudinally but slightly away laterally.
- Distance safety score: 3 (Medium Risk)
- Time Risk reason:  Slowly approaching longitudinally (-1.85 m/s).
- Time safety score: 3 (Medium Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 3 (Medium Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 332**
- Distance Risk reason: Zero distance longitudinally and laterally; Overlapping with the ego vehicle.
- Distance safety score: 0 (Collision)
- Time Risk reason: High negative relative longitudinal velocity (-10.10 m/s) indicates a likely collision already occurred or is imminent.
- Time safety score: 0 (Collision)
- Overall Risk score: 0 (Collision)
