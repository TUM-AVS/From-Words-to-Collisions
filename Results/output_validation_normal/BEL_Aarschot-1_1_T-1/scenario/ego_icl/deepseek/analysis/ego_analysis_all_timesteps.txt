Let me analyze each obstacle at the most recent timestep (0.9 seconds) and assess collision risks:

1. **Obstacle 32 (Front-left)**
   - Adjusted distances: longitudinal 1.95m, lateral 2.68m
   - Relative velocity: longitudinal -10.10 m/s (approaching), lateral -0.00 m/s
   - TTC (longitudinal): 1.95/10.10 = 0.193s (Extreme Risk)
   - MDC: Lateral distance is stable at ~2.68m (Low Risk)
   - Overall Risk: 1 (Extreme Risk due to very low TTC longitudinally)

2. **Obstacle 310 (Front-left)**
   - Adjusted distances: longitudinal 9.44m, lateral 3.07m
   - Relative velocity: longitudinal -10.10 m/s, lateral -0.00 m/s
   - TTC (longitudinal): 9.44/10.10 = 0.935s (High Risk)
   - MDC: Lateral distance ~3.07m (Low Risk)
   - Overall Risk: 2 (High Risk longitudinally)

3. **Obstacle 318 (Front-left)**
   - Adjusted distances: longitudinal 17.18m, lateral 3.49m
   - Relative velocity: longitudinal -10.37 m/s, lateral -0.02 m/s
   - TTC (longitudinal): 17.18/10.37 = 1.66s (Medium Risk)
   - MDC: Lateral distance ~3.49m (Low Risk)
   - Overall Risk: 3 (Medium Risk longitudinally)

4. **Obstacle 326 (Front)**
   - Adjusted distances: longitudinal 15.98m, lateral 0.00m
   - Relative velocity: longitudinal -1.85 m/s, lateral 0.36 m/s
   - TTC (longitudinal): 15.98/1.85 = 8.64s (No Risk)
   - MDC: Lateral distance 0.00m but moving away (No Risk)
   - Overall Risk: 5 (No Risk)

5. **Obstacle 332 (Left)**
   - Adjusted distances: longitudinal 0.00m, lateral 2.29m
   - Relative velocity: longitudinal -10.10 m/s, lateral -0.00 m/s
   - TTC (longitudinal): Already aligned (0.00m)
   - MDC: Lateral distance 2.29m (Low Risk)
   - Overall Risk: 1 (Extreme Risk due to exact longitudinal alignment with approaching motion)

**Trajectory Analysis:**
- Obstacle 32 shows rapid longitudinal closing (from 9.44m at 0.1s to 1.95m at 0.9s)
- Obstacle 332 maintains exact longitudinal alignment (0.00m) while being 2.29m laterally offset
- Other obstacles show stable or increasing lateral distances

**Collision Scenario Determination:**
This is a collision scenario because:
1. Obstacle 32 has Extreme Risk (TTC = 0.193s)
2. Obstacle 332 has Extreme Risk (exact longitudinal alignment with approaching motion)

{
    "CollisionObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "None",
        "OverallRiskScore": "0"
    },
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "32, 332",
        "OverallRiskScore": "1"
    },
    "IsCollisionScenario": true,
    "Justification": "Obstacle 32 has TTC=0.193s (Extreme Risk) and Obstacle 332 maintains exact longitudinal alignment while approaching, creating imminent collision risk"
}
