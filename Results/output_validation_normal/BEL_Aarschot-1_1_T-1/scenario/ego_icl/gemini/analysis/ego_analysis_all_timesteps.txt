* **Obstacle 32 Analysis:**

    * Trajectory: This obstacle is approaching the ego vehicle from the front-left.  Across the timesteps, both longitudinal and lateral distances are decreasing.
    * At t=0.9s: Longitudinal distance = 1.95m, Lateral distance = 2.68m, Longitudinal velocity = -10.10 m/s, Lateral Velocity = -0.00 m/s.
    * TTC (Longitudinal): 1.95m / 10.10m/s = 0.19s
    * MDC: Since this is a front-left obstacle, the primary concern is the longitudinal distance.  MDC ≈ 1.95m
    * Risk Assessment:
        * Longitudinal: TTC of 0.19s indicates **Extreme Risk (1)**.
        * Lateral: While the lateral distance is currently 2.68m (Medium Risk), the converging longitudinal trajectory and very short TTC override this.
        * Overall Risk: **Extreme Risk (1)** due to the imminent longitudinal collision.

* **Obstacle 310 Analysis:**

    * Trajectory: Approaching the ego vehicle from the front-left. Both longitudinal and lateral distances decrease across timesteps.
    * At t=0.9s: Longitudinal distance = 9.44m, Lateral distance = 3.07m, Longitudinal velocity = -10.10 m/s, Lateral Velocity = -0.00 m/s
    * TTC (Longitudinal): 9.44m / 10.10m/s = 0.93s
    * MDC:  MDC ≈ 9.44m (using longitudinal distance as primary concern)
    * Risk Assessment:
        * Longitudinal: TTC of 0.93s suggests **High Risk (2)**.
        * Lateral: Lateral distance of 3.07m also suggests **Medium Risk (3)**.
        * Overall Risk: **High Risk (2)** due to the high closing speed and sub-1s TTC.

* **Obstacle 318 Analysis:**

    * Trajectory: This obstacle is approaching from the front-left, with both distances decreasing across timesteps.
    * At t=0.9s: Longitudinal distance = 17.18m, Lateral distance = 3.49m, Longitudinal velocity = -10.37 m/s, Lateral Velocity = -0.02 m/s
    * TTC (Longitudinal): 17.18m / 10.37m/s = 1.66s
    * MDC: MDC ≈ 17.18m
    * Risk Assessment:
        * Longitudinal: TTC of 1.66s indicates **Medium Risk (3).**
        * Lateral:  Lateral distance of 3.49m also indicates **Medium Risk (3).**
        * Overall Risk: **Medium Risk (3)**

* **Obstacle 326 Analysis:**

    * Trajectory:  Approaching from the front, lateral distance fluctuating near zero.
    * At t=0.9s: Longitudinal distance = 15.98m, Lateral distance = 0.00m, Longitudinal velocity = -1.85 m/s, Lateral Velocity = 0.36 m/s.
    * TTC (Longitudinal): 15.98m / 1.85 m/s = 8.64s
    * MDC: While lateral distance is zero, the "Exact lateral alignment" description suggests they are not colliding, but rather on nearly the same path longitudinally. Therefore, MDC is primarily based on longitudinal distance and trajectory, so MDC ≈ 15.98m
    * Risk Assessment:
        * Longitudinal: TTC of 8.64s suggests **No Risk (5).**
        * Lateral: The near-zero lateral distance might initially suggest collision risk.  However, the motion description clarifies this is an alignment, not a collision.  Furthermore, the small positive lateral velocity indicates obstacle 326 is very slightly drifting away from the ego vehicle. Thus, the lateral risk is low.
        * Overall Risk: **No Risk (5)**

* **Obstacle 332 Analysis:**

    * Trajectory: This obstacle maintains a near-zero longitudinal distance while the lateral distance is relatively stable.
    * At t=0.9s: Longitudinal distance = 0.00m, Lateral distance = 2.29m, Longitudinal velocity = -10.10 m/s, Lateral Velocity = -0.00 m/s.
    * MDC: 2.29m
    * Risk Assessment:
        * Longitudinal: Despite the 0.00m longitudinal distance, the motion description explicitly states "Exact longitudinal alignment". This means the vehicles are aligned but not colliding. The negative longitudinal velocity suggests the obstacle has just slightly passed the ego vehicle, but isn't in its path. The risk is therefore low based on the provided data.
        * Lateral: The lateral distance of 2.29m indicates **Medium Risk (3)**.
        * Overall Risk: **Medium Risk (3)**


* **Collision Scenario Determination:**
Obstacle 32 poses an Extreme Risk (1) with a TTC of only 0.19s. This qualifies the scenario as a **collision scenario**.
