Obstacle 30652 is consistently approaching Ego's vehicle, and the distance between them is decreasing over the provided timesteps. Although a collision hasn't occurred within the first 0.9 seconds, the continuous approach and relatively high speeds of both vehicles suggest a high risk of collision in the near future.  Obstacle 30639 appears stationary and doesn't pose an immediate threat.  More data points beyond 0.9 seconds are needed to definitively determine if a collision is unavoidable, but based on the given data, Obstacle 30652 presents a substantial risk.
