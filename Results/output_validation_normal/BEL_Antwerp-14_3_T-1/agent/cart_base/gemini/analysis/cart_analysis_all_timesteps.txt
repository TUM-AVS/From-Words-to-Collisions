Obstacle 30652 is initially traveling in the same direction as the ego vehicle, but in a different lane (lanelet 940 vs. 53).  Over the provided timesteps, the lateral distance between the vehicles remains significant. While the obstacle's lanelet changes a few times (940 -> 1147 -> 939), these lane changes don't appear to immediately put it on a collision course with the ego vehicle, given the maintained lateral separation.

Obstacle 30639 appears suddenly at t=0.4s and is stationary.  Its position is significantly different from the ego vehicle's path, suggesting no immediate collision risk.


Based on the provided data, there are no immediate collision risks.
