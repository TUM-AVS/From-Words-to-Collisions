At t=0.9s, the ego vehicle is at (-454.5361, -336.9459) with a velocity of 10.352 and heading 1.1438 radians.  Two obstacles are present:

* **Obstacle 30639:** Stationary at (-447.937, -313.7016). This obstacle represents minimal risk due to its static nature and distance from the ego vehicle.
* **Obstacle 30652:** Located at (-445.8799, -317.6921) with a velocity of 15.5414 and heading 1.1518 radians. This obstacle requires closer examination.

**Analysis focusing on Obstacle 30652:**

1. **Relative Position:** Obstacle 30652 is approximately 8.6562 meters East and 19.2538 meters North of the ego vehicle.  This places it diagonally ahead and to the right.

2. **Relative Velocity:**  Both vehicles are moving in roughly the same direction (similar orientations). The obstacle is moving slightly faster than the ego vehicle.  This means the primary concern is the lateral separation, as the longitudinal velocity difference is relatively small.

3. **TTC Estimation (Approximation):**  A precise TTC calculation is complex due to the changing velocities and orientations.  However, given the lateral distance of approximately 8.6562 meters and a rough combined lateral velocity difference (difficult to determine from the given data without assumptions), a precise TTC is hard to provide. However, given their current trajectories, there appears to be enough lateral separation to avoid a collision in the very near future (next few seconds), assuming they maintain their current headings and accelerations.

4. **MDC:**  The minimum distance between the ego and Obstacle 30652 at t=0.9s is approximately 21.02 meters.

5. **Predicted Future Positions:**  Without more sophisticated predictive modeling, we can roughly estimate future positions by assuming constant velocity and heading. This is a simplification, but useful for a quick assessment.  Based on this, a collision does not seem imminent in the immediate future, but more time steps are needed to definitively rule out future risk, especially if the vehicles start maneuvering (e.g., lane changes). The relatively similar orientations and speeds suggest that they might be on converging paths in the longer term.

**Risk Assessment:**

* **Obstacle 30639:** Negligible Risk (Score 5) due to distance and static nature.
* **Obstacle 30652:** Medium Risk (Score 3) due to the moderately close proximity, relatively similar orientations, and the possibility of converging paths in the future. More data is needed to refine this assessment.
