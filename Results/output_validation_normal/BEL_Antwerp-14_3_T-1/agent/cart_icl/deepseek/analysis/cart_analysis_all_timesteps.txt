### Analysis:

1. **Obstacle 30639 (Stationary Obstacle)**:
   - Position: (-447.937, -313.7016)
   - The obstacle is stationary (velocity = 0.0, acceleration = 0.0).
   - The ego vehicle is moving towards the obstacle but is still at a significant distance (~25m at 0.9s).
   - The ego vehicle is decelerating (acceleration = -1.3299), reducing the risk of collision.
   - **Overall Risk Score**: 4 (Low Risk) - Sufficient distance and deceleration to avoid collision.

2. **Obstacle 30652 (Moving Obstacle)**:
   - Position: (-445.8799, -317.6921) at 0.9s.
   - The obstacle is moving with a velocity of 15.5414 m/s and accelerating (0.6349 m/sÂ²).
   - The ego vehicle is at (-454.5361, -336.9459) at 0.9s.
   - The relative distance between ego and obstacle is increasing over time, indicating no immediate risk of collision.
   - **Overall Risk Score**: 5 (Negligible Risk) - No significant risk due to increasing distance.
