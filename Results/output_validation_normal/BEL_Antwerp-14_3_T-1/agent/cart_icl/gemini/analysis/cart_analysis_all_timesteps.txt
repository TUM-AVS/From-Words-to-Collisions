At t=0.9s, the ego vehicle is at (-454.5361, -336.9459) with a velocity of 10.352 m/s and acceleration of -1.3299 m/s².  There are two obstacles to consider:

**Obstacle 30639:** Stationary, located at (-447.937, -313.7016). This obstacle poses no immediate collision risk as it is significantly far from the ego vehicle's trajectory.  Lateral distance is substantial, and the ego vehicle's trajectory does not intersect with the obstacle's position.  Risk: **Negligible (5)**.

**Obstacle 30652:** Located at (-445.8799, -317.6921) with a velocity of 15.5414 m/s and acceleration of 0.6349 m/s². This obstacle is moving in a roughly parallel direction to the ego vehicle but is located further along the negative Y-axis (ahead and to the ego vehicle's left).  Even though obstacle 30652 is in a different lanelet, the consistent velocity and slightly increasing acceleration suggest minimal risk. Risk: **Low (4)**
