Here's the analysis of the provided scenarios:

**Timestep 0.9 seconds:**

1. **Obstacle 30652.0**:
   - **Position**: (-445.8799, -317.6921)
   - **Orientation**: 1.1518
   - **Velocity**: 15.5414
   - Relative to Ego:
     - The position of the Ego: (-454.5361, -336.9459)
     - The obstacle is significantly ahead in the same general forward trajectory but in a different lanelet (lanelet 939.0).
     - Both Ego and the obstacle are moving forward, and relative lateral distance increases due to different lanelets.
     - **TTC**: Ego is slower, around 10.352 m/s, compared to the obstacle's 15.5414 m/s. The obstacle is further and not on a direct collision path, given different lanelets.
     - **MDC**: The distance in terms of Cartesian coordinates is such that they are not converging towards collision.
     - **Risk Assessment**: The relative motion does not imply a direct risk of collision as both vehicles are following paths in different lanes with sufficient separation. Therefore, **Negligible Risk (5)**.

2. **Obstacle 30639.0**:
   - **Position**: (-447.937, -313.7016)
   - **Orientation**: -1.9876
   - **Velocity**: 0.0 (Stationary)
   - Relative to Ego:
     - Located on a completely different trajectory and lanelet (lanelet 338.0).
     - Stationary with no forward movement.
     - **Risk Assessment**: No intersection with the Ego vehicle's path trajectory due to being off-route and stationary. **Negligible Risk (5)**.

**Conclusion:**
- None of the obstacles are on a direct collision path with the Ego vehicle. There is ample separation both laterally and longitudinally.
- Current movements and positions do not suggest any immediate threats.
