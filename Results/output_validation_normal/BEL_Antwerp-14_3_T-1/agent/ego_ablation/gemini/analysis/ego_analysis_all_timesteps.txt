At the most recent timestep (0.9 seconds), Obstacle 30639 is in the Front-left of the ego car, with a longitudinal distance of 19.38 meters and a lateral distance of 2.01 meters.  It has a relative longitudinal velocity of -10.35 m/s, meaning it is approaching the ego car rapidly. While the lateral distance is significant enough to likely avoid a collision, the closing longitudinal speed warrants close monitoring.

Obstacle 30652 is in front of the ego car, with a longitudinal distance of 16.60 meters and a lateral distance of 0.00 meters. This obstacle has a relative longitudinal velocity of 5.19 m/s, implying it is moving away from the ego car. While the lateral alignment suggests a potential risk if the ego vehicle were to move forward directly, the obstacle is moving away and doesn't pose an immediate threat. Neither obstacle presents an extreme or high risk of collision.
