### Obstacle-by-Obstacle Analysis

#### Obstacle 30639 (Front-left of ego car)
- **Most Recent Timestep (0.9s):**
  - **Adjusted Distances:** Longitudinal 19.38 m, Lateral 2.01 m
  - **Relative Velocity:** Longitudinal -10.35 m/s (approaching), Lateral -0.00 m/s (no lateral motion)
  - **Motion Description:** Obstacle is driving toward the ego car longitudinally. No lateral relative motion.
  
- **Trajectory Analysis:**
  - The obstacle is consistently approaching the ego car longitudinally with a high relative velocity (~10-11 m/s).
  - Lateral distance remains constant at 2.01 m, indicating no lateral movement toward the ego car.
  
- **TTC Calculation:**
  - Longitudinal TTC = 19.38 m / 10.35 m/s â‰ˆ 1.87 seconds (Medium Risk)
  - Lateral TTC = N/A (no lateral motion)
  
- **MDC Calculation:**
  - Since the obstacle is diagonally positioned (front-left), we consider the smaller distance (lateral 2.01 m).
  - MDC = 2.01 m (Medium Risk)
  
- **Risk Assessment:**
  - Both TTC and MDC indicate Medium Risk (3).
  - No collision or extreme risk due to stable lateral distance and sufficient longitudinal distance.

#### Obstacle 30652 (Front of ego car)
- **Most Recent Timestep (0.9s):**
  - **Adjusted Distances:** Longitudinal 16.60 m, Lateral 0.00 m
  - **Relative Velocity:** Longitudinal 5.19 m/s (moving away), Lateral 0.12 m/s (minimal lateral motion)
  - **Motion Description:** Obstacle is moving away longitudinally. Exact lateral alignment or unknown case.
  
- **Trajectory Analysis:**
  - The obstacle is consistently moving away from the ego car longitudinally (increasing distance).
  - Lateral alignment is exact (0.00 m), but no significant lateral motion toward the ego car.
  
- **TTC Calculation:**
  - Longitudinal TTC = N/A (moving away, no collision risk)
  - Lateral TTC = 0.00 m / 0.12 m/s = 0 seconds (but negligible due to minimal velocity)
  
- **MDC Calculation:**
  - Since the obstacle is longitudinally aligned (lateral 0.00 m), we consider longitudinal distance.
  - MDC = 16.60 m (No Risk)
  
- **Risk Assessment:**
  - No risk of collision (5) as the obstacle is moving away and lateral motion is negligible.

### Explanation:
- **Obstacle 30639:** Medium Risk (3) due to approaching longitudinally but with stable lateral distance and sufficient time/distance to react.
- **Obstacle 30652:** No Risk (5) as it is moving away from the ego car with no significant lateral motion.
- No collision or extreme/high-risk obstacles detected in the most recent timestep.
