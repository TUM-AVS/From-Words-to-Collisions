### Analysis Overview

Let's proceed with analyzing the latest information about the two identified obstacles at t=0.9 seconds.

### Obstacle Analysis

#### Obstacle 30639 (Front-Left)
- **Position and Motion:**
  - Adjusted Longitudinal distance: 19.38 meters
  - Adjusted Lateral distance: 2.01 meters
  - Relative velocity (longitudinal): -10.35 m/s (approaching)
  - Relative velocity (lateral): 0.00 m/s
  - Motion description: Obstacle is driving toward the ego car longitudinally. No lateral relative motion.

- **Trajectory Assessment:**
  - The obstacle is moving directly toward the ego vehicle longitudinally, decreasing its longitudinal distance significantly while maintaining steady lateral distance.

- **TTC Calculation:**
  - Longitudinal distance: 19.38 meters
  - TTC (longitudinal) = 19.38 meters / 10.35 m/s â‰ˆ 1.87 seconds
  - Since lateral velocity is 0, TTC doesn't apply for lateral movement.

- **Risk Assessment:**
  - The decreasing longitudinal distance combined with closing velocity results in a TTC that presents a **Medium Risk**.
  - Additional acceleration suggests increasing velocity, but the longitudinal distance is sufficiently large to avoid imminent collision.
  - As there is no lateral closing movement, lateral risk is minimal.

#### Obstacle 30652 (Front)
- **Position and Motion:**
  - Adjusted Longitudinal distance: 16.60 meters
  - Adjusted Lateral distance: 0.00 meters
  - Relative velocity (longitudinal): 5.19 m/s (moving away)
  - Relative velocity (lateral): 0.12 m/s
  - Motion description: Obstacle is moving away longitudinally. Exact lateral alignment or unknown case.

- **Trajectory Assessment:**
  - The obstacle is aligned longitudinally with the ego vehicle, continuing to move away, slightly increasing in both the longitudinal and lateral dimensions.

- **TTC Calculation:**
  - Longitudinal distance is increasing, making the TTC not applicable for collision. The obstacle is moving away.
  - Lateral movement is minimal and increasing, meaning no risk due to lateral movement either.

- **Risk Assessment:**
  - The relative velocity and increasing distance indicate **Negligible Risk**.

### JSON Summary
