At t=0.9s, Ego is at (-454.5361, -336.9459) with a velocity of 10.352 m/s.

Obstacle 30639 is stationary at (-447.937, -313.7016).  Given the distances and Ego's velocity, a collision is not imminent in the next few timesteps.

Obstacle 30652 is at (-445.8799, -317.6921) with a velocity of 15.5414 m/s. While the y-coordinates are somewhat separated, the x-coordinates are converging rapidly.  Given the high speeds of both Ego and Obstacle 30652, and their closing x-coordinates, an extreme risk of collision exists.
