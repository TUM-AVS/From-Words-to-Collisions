At t=0.9s, Ego is at (-454.5361, -336.9459) with a velocity of 10.352 m/s.

Obstacle 30639 is stationary at (-447.937, -313.7016).  While the y-coordinates are somewhat different, the x-coordinates are close enough to warrant concern given the ego vehicle's continued movement in the negative x direction. This obstacle represents a potential extreme risk if the ego vehicle does not change lanes or decelerate.

Obstacle 30652 is at (-445.8799, -317.6921) with a velocity of 15.5414 m/s. This obstacle is moving faster than the ego vehicle and in roughly the same direction, but further along.  Given the x and y position relative to the ego vehicle, this does not present an immediate collision risk.
