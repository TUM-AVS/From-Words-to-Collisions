### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 30639.0
- Distance Risk reason: The obstacle is stationary and located at (-447.937, -313.7016) while the ego vehicle is at (-454.5361, -336.9459) moving with a velocity of 10.352. The distance between them and their trajectories suggest no immediate risk.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason:  The obstacle is stationary and poses no immediate time-based risk to the ego vehicle based on current trajectories.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 30652.0
- Distance Risk reason: The obstacle is located at (-445.8799, -317.6921) and the ego vehicle is at (-454.5361, -336.9459). They are in different lanelets and their trajectories suggest no immediate risk. Although the y-coordinates are getting closer, the difference in x-coordinates and separate lanelets significantly reduce the risk.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: The obstacle has a velocity of 15.5414 and the ego vehicle has a velocity of 10.352.  While the obstacle is moving faster, their differing trajectories and lanelets mitigate the time-based risk. The lanelets' information imply they are not on a direct collision course in the immediate future.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4


### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. **Most critical obstacle:** Obstacle 30652.0 is the most critical obstacle due to its proximity and higher velocity compared to the ego vehicle. Obstacle 30639.0 is stationary and presents no risk based on the data.
2. **Trajectory analysis:** Over the past 10 timesteps, the ego vehicle has been consistently moving in a relatively straight path while decelerating. Obstacle 30652.0 also moves at a relatively constant velocity with slight acceleration fluctuations but in a different lanelet. Obstacle 30639.0 is stationary throughout.
3. **Relative positions, velocities, and accelerations:** The ego vehicle and obstacle 30652.0 have differing x-coordinates and are getting closer in y-coordinates. The obstacle's higher speed is mitigated by the different lanelets and diverging trajectories.
4. **Collision determination:** Based on the current data and trajectory analysis, a collision is not imminent within the foreseeable future. The lane information is crucial, suggesting that even with approaching y-coordinates, the vehicles will not intersect.
5. **Reasoning:** The consistent trajectories, lane separation, and diverging x-coordinates strongly suggest that the ego vehicle and obstacle 30652.0 will not collide.  Although 30652.0 is moving faster and closer in the y direction, the different lanes and x-coordinates combined with the ego vehicle's trajectory suggest they are moving apart, rather than directly towards each other. The stationary nature of obstacle 30639.0 further eliminates it as a risk factor.
