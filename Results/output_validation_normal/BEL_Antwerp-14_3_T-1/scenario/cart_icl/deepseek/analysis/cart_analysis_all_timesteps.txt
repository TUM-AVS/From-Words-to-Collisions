### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep (0.9 seconds):

### Obstacle Analysis:
1. **Obstacle ID: 30639**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Static obstacle at (-447.937, -313.7016), far from ego's trajectory. Distance is increasing as ego moves away.
   - **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: Static obstacle with no velocity or acceleration. No time-based risk.
   - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)

2. **Obstacle ID: 30652**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Moving away from ego's trajectory. Distance between ego (-454.5361, -336.9459) and obstacle (-445.8799, -317.6921) is ~19.5m and increasing.
   - **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: Relative velocity is ~5.2m/s (ego decelerating, obstacle maintaining speed). TTC is ~3.75s (safe).
   - **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low Risk)

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. Ego is decelerating consistently (negative acceleration) in lanelet 53.0.
2. Obstacle 30652 is moving away from ego's path (lanelet 939.0 vs. ego's 53.0) with increasing distance.
3. Obstacle 30639 is static and far from ego's trajectory.
4. No intersecting paths or immediate collision risks detected.
