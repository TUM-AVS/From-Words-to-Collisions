### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
This is not a collision scenario. No obstacles are on a direct collision course with the ego vehicle. While some obstacles are in the same lanelet, they maintain safe following distances. Other obstacles are in different lanelets and pose no immediate threat.
