### Obstacle Analysis:

#### Obstacle ID: 30636
- **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is located in lanelet 114, fairly distant from the ego vehicle's lanelet 53. Position changes indicate it's moving away or parallel to the ego's path.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: It's maintaining a consistent speed and direction with minimal acceleration changes, indicating stable and predictable behavior.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 30637
- **Distance Risk reason**: Located in the same lanelet as ego vehicle 53, maintaining proximity but not converging. Previous positions show consistent trajectories slightly behind the ego.
- **Distance safety score**: 3
- **Time Risk reason**: The obstacle has similar orientation and speed, with moderate velocity fluctuations, indicating potential alignment with ego but not intersecting imminently.
- **Time safety score**: 3
- **Overall Risk score**: 3

#### Obstacle ID: 30638
- **Distance Risk reason**: Previously in lanelet 1150 and moving inconsistently relative to the ego vehicle's position, it isn't converging with its path.
- **Distance safety score**: 4
- **Time Risk reason**: There are fluctuations in velocity and sudden directional changes that complicate predicting exact movement towards ego.
- **Time safety score**: 4
- **Overall Risk score**: 4

#### Obstacle ID: 30639
- **Distance Risk reason**: Stationary in lanelet 338, not affecting the ego vehicle in lanelet 53.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: As its velocity and acceleration are zero, no time-risk is posed to the ego vehicle.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 30640
- **Distance Risk reason**: Also stationary and in a different lanelet (338), not interfering with the ego vehicle.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: Similar to Obstacle 30639, poses no risk as there's no notable movement.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 30642
- **Distance Risk reason**: Due to location in lanelet 111 and steady trajectory away from ego, minimal interaction is expected.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: Speed and acceleration patterns do not indicate rapid convergence towards ego.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 30643
- **Distance Risk reason**: Lanelet 53 matches the ego's path, but it maintains a reasonably separated trailing position.
- **Distance safety score**: 3
- **Time Risk reason**: Slight fluctuation in speed could suggest parallel or trailing travel, not consumption.
- **Time safety score**: 3
- **Overall Risk score**: 3

#### Obstacle ID: 30644
- **Distance Risk reason**: Lanelet 111 and stable paths indicate divergent paths or non-interfering trajectories.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: Stable and slow velocity changes affirm no significant time-converging paths.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 30647
- **Distance Risk reason**: Same lanelet as the ego vehicle with proximate positioning; however, it shows parallel motion rather than intersecting tracks.
- **Distance safety score**: 3
- **Time Risk reason**: The acceleration shifts noted are minimal, reducing immediate collision risks.
- **Time safety score**: 3
- **Overall Risk score**: 3

#### Obstacle ID: 30648
- **Distance Risk reason**: Stationary and located in an undefined lanelet (-1.0), presents no threat.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: No motion suggests a stable, non-moving obstacle.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 30649
- **Distance Risk reason**: Stationary in lanelet 338, similar configuration to Obstacle 30639, hence not conflicting.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: The small movements observed do not suggest imminent time-based threats.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 30650
- **Distance Risk reason**: Although in the same lanelet, the consistent separation offsets immediate collision paths.
- **Distance safety score**: 3
- **Time Risk reason**: Its speed and acceleration variants remain minimal, lowering time-induced risks.
- **Time safety score**: 3
- **Overall Risk score**: 3

#### Obstacle ID: 30652
- **Distance Risk reason**: Obstacle at edge of ego path in different lanelet configuration initially suggests non-intersection.
- **Distance safety score**: 4
- **Time Risk reason**: Movements appear parallel or moving away, reducing time-induced collision.
- **Time safety score**: 4
- **Overall Risk score**: 4

#### Obstacle ID: 30653
- **Distance Risk reason**: Located in lanelet 113, its position suggests no overlap with ego's path.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: Their speed and changes do not imply a risk of converging on the ego's path.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 30654
- **Distance Risk reason**: Similar to obstacle 30653, trajectory does not intersect with ego path.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: No directional changes indicate a trajectory leading to ego path conflict.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 30655
- **Distance Risk reason**: Positionally located in lanelet 338 with little scope for immediate conflicting paths to the ego vehicle.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: Acceleration changes suggest minimal time infringement potential.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
Overall, no Obstacle poses a collision risk or extreme risk due to distance separation or parallel pathing. Although some obstacles share the same lanelet, the historical analysis shows non-overlapping and minimal convergence trajectories implying no collision scenario.
