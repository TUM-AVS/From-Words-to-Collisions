Obstacle 30652 is moving away from the ego vehicle, posing no risk. Obstacle 30639 is approaching the ego vehicle at a substantial closing velocity (-10.35 m/s) but is still relatively far (19.38m) with some lateral offset (2.01m). While this obstacle warrants attention, it doesn't pose an *extreme* risk given the current distance and closing velocity if appropriate avoidance maneuvers are executed.
