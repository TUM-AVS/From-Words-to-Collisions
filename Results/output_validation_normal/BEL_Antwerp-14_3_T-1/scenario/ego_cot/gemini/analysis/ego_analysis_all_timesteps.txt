### Safety analysis for timestep 0.9 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID:** 30639
- **Distance Risk reason:** Obstacle 30639 is at 19.38m longitudinally and laterally, located front-left. While the distance is significant, its rapid approach towards the ego vehicle raises concern.
- **Distance safety score:** 4 (Low Risk)
- **Time Risk reason:**  Although no TTC is explicitly provided, the closing longitudinal velocity (-10.35 m/s) while moving directly towards the ego car suggests a short TTC, necessitating attention.  The lateral velocity is negligible.
- **Time safety score:** 3 (Medium Risk)
- **Overall Risk score:** 3 (Medium Risk)

- **Obstacle ID:** 30652
- **Distance Risk reason:**  Obstacle 30652 is moving away longitudinally (16.60m) and laterally (16.60m) from the ego vehicle, posing minimal risk.
- **Distance safety score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)
- **Time Risk reason:** The positive longitudinal velocity (5.19 m/s) confirms the obstacle's receding motion, further mitigating risk. The lateral velocity is negligible.
- **Time safety score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)
- **Overall Risk score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)


### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
  "CollisionObstacle": null,
  "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null,
  "IsCollisionScenario": false,
  "Justification": "No obstacles pose an immediate collision risk. Obstacle 30639 requires monitoring due to its approaching trajectory, but current distances and the lack of immediate lateral movement suggest a manageable risk level."
}
