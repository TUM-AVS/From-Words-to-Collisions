### Obstacle-by-Obstacle Analysis

#### Obstacle 30639 (Front-left of ego car)
- **Most Recent Timestep (0.9s):**
  - **Adjusted Distances:** 
    - Longitudinal: 19.38 m (approaching at -10.35 m/s)
    - Lateral: 2.01 m (stable, no relative motion)
  - **Relative Velocity:** 
    - Longitudinal: -10.35 m/s (approaching)
    - Lateral: -0.00 m/s (stable)
  - **Motion Description:** Obstacle is driving toward the ego car longitudinally. No lateral relative motion.
  
- **Trajectory Analysis:**
  - The obstacle is consistently approaching the ego vehicle longitudinally with a high relative velocity (~-10.35 m/s).
  - Lateral distance remains stable at 2.01 m, indicating no lateral movement toward the ego vehicle.
  
- **TTC Calculation:**
  - Longitudinal TTC = 19.38 m / 10.35 m/s â‰ˆ 1.87 seconds (Medium Risk, TTC between 1.0-3.0s).
  - Lateral TTC: Not applicable (no relative motion).
  
- **MDC Calculation:**
  - Since the obstacle is diagonally positioned (front-left), MDC is the smaller of the two distances, which is the lateral distance (2.01 m).
  - MDC = 2.01 m (Medium Risk, MDC between 1.0-3.0m).
  
- **Overall Risk Score:**
  - Both TTC and MDC indicate Medium Risk (3).
  - No immediate collision risk, but monitoring is required due to high longitudinal closing speed.

#### Obstacle 30652 (Front of ego car)
- **Most Recent Timestep (0.9s):**
  - **Adjusted Distances:** 
    - Longitudinal: 16.60 m (moving away at 5.19 m/s)
    - Lateral: 0.00 m (exact alignment, but moving away longitudinally)
  - **Relative Velocity:** 
    - Longitudinal: 5.19 m/s (moving away)
    - Lateral: 0.12 m/s (minor lateral drift)
  - **Motion Description:** Obstacle is moving away longitudinally. Exact lateral alignment or unknown case.
  
- **Trajectory Analysis:**
  - The obstacle is consistently moving away from the ego vehicle longitudinally (increasing distance).
  - Lateral alignment is exact (0.00 m), but the minor lateral drift (0.12 m/s) does not indicate convergence.
  
- **TTC Calculation:**
  - Longitudinal TTC: Not applicable (moving away).
  - Lateral TTC: Not applicable (minor drift, no convergence).
  
- **MDC Calculation:**
  - Since the obstacle is longitudinally aligned (lateral = 0.00 m), MDC is effectively the longitudinal distance (16.60 m).
  - MDC = 16.60 m (No Risk, MDC > 5.0m).
  
- **Overall Risk Score:**
  - No Risk (5). The obstacle is moving away and poses no collision threat.

### Collision Scenario Determination
- Neither obstacle has a risk score of 0 (Collision) or 1 (Extreme Risk).
- Obstacle 30639 poses Medium Risk (3), and Obstacle 30652 poses No Risk (5).
- This is **not** a collision scenario.
