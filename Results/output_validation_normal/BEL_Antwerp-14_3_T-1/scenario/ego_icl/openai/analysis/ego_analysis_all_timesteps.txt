### Obstacle-by-Obstacle Analysis

#### Obstacle 30652

- **Trajectory Analysis:**
  - The obstacle is consistently moving away from the ego vehicle based on past intervals, showing increasing longitudinal distance.
  - At the most recent timestep (0.9 seconds), the longitudinal distance is 16.60 m, and lateral distance (adjusted) is 0.00 m.
  - The relative longitudinal velocity and acceleration are both positive, confirming that the obstacle continues to move away.

- **MDC and TTC Calculation:**
  - **MDC:** With increasing longitudinal distance and positive relative velocity, the obstacle is not on a converging path. Thus, there's effectively no minimum distance to collision, as projections indicate divergence.
  - **TTC:** Using the adjusted longitudinal distance and relative velocity: 
    \[
    TTC = \frac{16.60 \, m}{5.19 \, m/s} = 3.20 \, seconds
    \] 
  - **Risk Assessment:**
    - Based on the relative velocity and increasing distance, the risk level is low to none. The absence of lateral relative velocity further lowers the risk.
    - **Assigned Risk Score:** 5 (No Risk)

#### Obstacle 30639

- **Trajectory Analysis:**
  - This obstacle is moving towards the ego vehicle with a consistently decreasing longitudinal distance.
  - At 0.9 seconds, the longitudinal distance (adjusted) is 19.38 m, lateral distance is 2.01 m, and it is approaching with a negative relative longitudinal velocity.

- **MDC and TTC Calculation:**
  - **MDC:** The shortest projected distance is constrained by the lateral alignment. Though longitudinally decreasing rapidly, lateral stability suggests a diagonal alignment reducing collision probability.
    - Considering approaching trajectory and minimal lateral effect, convergence continues but not imminently.
  - **TTC:** With approaching speed:
    \[
    TTC = \frac{19.38 \, m}{10.35 \, m/s} = 1.87 \, seconds
    \]
  - **Risk Assessment:**
    - The longitudinal approach suggests collision is feasible. However, lateral stability delays immediate risk.
    - **Assigned Risk Score:** 3 (Medium Risk)

### Conclusion and Determination

Through detailed assessment of the most recent data, we determined no collision is concurrently occurring or is extremely imminent with any obstacle. Obstacle 30652 is moving away, while Obstacle 30639, although approaching, presents only a medium risk due to stabilizing lateral factors.
