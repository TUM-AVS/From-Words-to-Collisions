The ego vehicle and obstacle 30636.0 are in the same lanelet (53.0).  The obstacle is ahead of the ego vehicle and initially moving faster. However, the obstacle's velocity is decreasing rapidly due to large negative acceleration, while the ego vehicle's velocity is relatively stable and even increasing slightly in later timesteps.  The distance between them is shrinking but at a decreasing rate. Although a collision is not imminent within the provided timeframe, the rapidly changing velocity of the obstacle warrants close monitoring.  It is a high risk situation because if the ego vehicle continues to accelerate while the obstacle decelerates rapidly, a collision could become likely.
