Here's the collision risk analysis for the provided scenario:

**Analysis at t=0.9s:**

1. **Ego Vehicle State:**
    - Position: (-463.7106, -357.1023)
    - Velocity: 13.0181 
    - Acceleration: 0.1226
    - Orientation: 1.1442007183729233

2. **Obstacle Vehicle State (ID: 30636.0):**
    - Position: (-455.0684, -338.1163)
    - Velocity: 11.5853
    - Acceleration: -6.4355
    - Orientation: 1.1437

3. **Inter-vehicle Metrics:**

    - **Distance:**  sqrt((-463.7106 + 455.0684)^2 + (-357.1023 + 338.1163)^2) â‰ˆ 22.67 meters.
    - **Velocity Difference:** The obstacle is slowing down significantly faster than the ego vehicle. This deceleration trend from past timesteps suggests the obstacle might slow down or stop completely soon. However, for now, the difference in velocity is relatively small.
    - **Approximate TTC (using current parameters without considering acceleration):**  Distance/Velocity Difference (using a projected velocity difference based on trends) - imprecise but indicative that there is sufficient time to react. As we do not know the angle between velocities, we use only the distance and roughly estimate a safe TTC.


4. **Risk Assessment:**
    - **Position and MDC:** While the vehicles are in the same lanelet and the distance is somewhat close, ~22 meters suggests they are not immediately about to collide.
    - **Velocity and TTC:** The obstacle's deceleration suggests the gap will likely increase rather than decrease.  
    - **Orientation:**  Orientations being similar means both vehicles are moving in roughly the same direction, mitigating some risk.  However, lateral separation analysis needs more information about the width of the lanelet and vehicle dimensions.


**Overall Risk Score for obstacle 30636.0: 3 (Medium Risk)**

The current gap gives the ego vehicle time to react. However, the obstacle's rapid deceleration needs to be monitored, and the ego vehicle should likely start to slow down proactively.  If the obstacle continues decelerating at the same rate, the risk could escalate within the next few seconds.
