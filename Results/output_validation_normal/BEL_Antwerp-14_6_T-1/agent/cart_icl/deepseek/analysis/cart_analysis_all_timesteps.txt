### Analysis:

1. **Relative Motion and Trajectory**:
   - Both the ego vehicle (30638.0) and the obstacle (30636.0) are moving in the same lanelet (53.0) with similar orientations (~1.1437 radians).
   - The obstacle is ahead of the ego vehicle and is decelerating more aggressively than the ego vehicle (obstacle acceleration: -6.4355 m/s² vs. ego acceleration: 0.1226 m/s²).

2. **Time to Collision (TTC)**:
   - At 0.9 seconds:
     - Relative longitudinal position (obstacle ahead): ~8.6422 m (distance between (-463.7106, -357.1023) and (-455.0684, -338.1163)).
     - Relative longitudinal velocity: ego velocity (13.0181 m/s) - obstacle velocity (11.5853 m/s) = 1.4328 m/s.
     - TTC = 8.6422 / 1.4328 ≈ 6.03 seconds (manageable with proper reaction).

3. **Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC)**:
   - The lateral distance is negligible since both are in the same lanelet with similar orientations.
   - The longitudinal distance is decreasing, but the obstacle's aggressive deceleration reduces the risk of collision.

4. **Risk Assessment**:
   - The TTC (~6.03s) and the obstacle's deceleration suggest a **Medium Risk (3)**. The ego vehicle has sufficient time to react, but monitoring is required.
