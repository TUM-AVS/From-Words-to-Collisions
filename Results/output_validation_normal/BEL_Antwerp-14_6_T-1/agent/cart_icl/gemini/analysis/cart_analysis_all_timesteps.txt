At t=0.9s, the ego vehicle at (-463.7106, -357.1023) is moving with a velocity of 13.0181 m/s and an acceleration of 0.1226 m/s². Obstacle 30636 is at (-455.0684, -338.1163) with a velocity of 11.5853 m/s and decelerating at -6.4355 m/s². Both are in the same lanelet (53.0).

The obstacle is ahead of the ego vehicle and slightly to its right.  Calculating the distance between the ego and the obstacle at t=0.9s:

```
dx = -455.0684 - (-463.7106) = 8.6422 m
dy = -338.1163 - (-357.1023) = 18.986 m
distance = sqrt(dx^2 + dy^2) = sqrt(8.6422^2 + 18.986^2) ≈ 20.83m
```
The obstacle is approximately 20.83 meters away from the ego vehicle.

While the obstacle is decelerating significantly, it's still moving forward and the ego vehicle is also moving forward with a higher velocity, indicating a potential catching-up scenario. However, the lateral distance suggests some separation.  Let's look at relative velocities:

```
relative_vx = 11.5853 - 13.0181 = -1.4328 m/s (ego is faster)
relative_vy = 0  (since both are almost perfectly in same heading)
```

A simplified TTC (ignoring lateral movement for a moment, as they have nearly identical orientation):
```
TTC ≈ dx / relative_vx ≈ 8.6422 / -1.4328 ≈ -6.03s
```
Simplified TTC suggests the ego is catching up but given near-identical headings, the negative value of -6.03 seconds indicates an overtaking situation, not a collision.

Considering the lateral distance (18.986m), the current situation presents low risk. This distance and respective velocities suggest a safe overtaking maneuver by the ego. We also need to consider future timesteps to ensure safety, but based on current data, there's no immediate danger.

Thus, the overall risk is assessed as 4 (Low Risk).
