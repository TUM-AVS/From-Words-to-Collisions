At t=0.9s, Obstacle 30636 is moving towards the ego vehicle with a longitudinal velocity of -1.43 m/s and is at a longitudinal distance of 16.35m.  The lateral distance is essentially zero, indicating the obstacle is directly ahead.  While the obstacle is approaching, the current distance and relative velocity suggest there is no immediate danger of a collision.  However, the consistent negative longitudinal acceleration suggests the closing rate will increase. Therefore, while not currently an extreme risk, this obstacle warrants continued monitoring as it could become high risk soon.
