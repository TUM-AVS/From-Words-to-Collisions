### Safety analysis for timestep 0.9s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:
- **Obstacle ID:** 30636
- **Distance Risk reason:** At 0.9 seconds, the obstacle is 16.35m longitudinally and 16.35m laterally away from the ego vehicle, located in front. This signifies a large separation distance, indicating minimal risk of collision based on distance alone.
- **Distance safety score:** 5
- **Time Risk reason:** The obstacle's longitudinal velocity is negative (-1.43 m/s) indicating movement towards the ego vehicle. While currently far, the closing velocity suggests potential future risk if this trend continues. However, the current TTC is relatively high.
- **Time safety score:** 4
- **Overall Risk score:** 4
