Obstacle 30636 is in front of the ego vehicle and has been consistently in the same lane (lateral distance 0.00m) throughout the provided timesteps.  The longitudinal distance has been increasing for the first 0.6 seconds indicating the obstacle was moving away from the ego vehicle. However, from 0.7 seconds onwards, the longitudinal distance starts to decrease, meaning the obstacle is now approaching the ego vehicle.

At the last timestep (0.9 seconds), the longitudinal distance is 16.35m and the relative longitudinal velocity is -1.43 m/s (approaching).

TTC Calculation:
TTC = distance / relative_velocity = 16.35m / 1.43 m/s â‰ˆ 11.43 seconds

MDC Calculation:
Since the obstacle is directly in front, MDC is primarily determined by the longitudinal distance, which is 16.35m.

Risk Assessment:
Based on TTC (11.43s) and MDC (16.35m), the risk level for Obstacle 30636 is 5 (Negligible Risk).
