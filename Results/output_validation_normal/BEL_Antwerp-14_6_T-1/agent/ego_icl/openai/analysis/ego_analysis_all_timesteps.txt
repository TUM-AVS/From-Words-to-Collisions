### Obstacle Analysis

**Obstacle 30636 Analysis:**

#### Trajectory Analysis:
- The obstacle was consistently in front of the ego vehicle and was initially moving away. However, starting from the timestamp at 0.7 seconds, it began moving towards the ego vehicle.

#### Position and Motion Details (at 0.9s):
- Adjusted longitudinal distance: 16.35 meters
- Adjusted lateral distance: 0.00 meters (indicative of alignment in the same lane)
- Relative longitudinal velocity: -1.43 m/s (indicating the obstacle is approaching the ego vehicle)
- Relative lateral velocity: -0.01 m/s

#### Calculations:
1. **Time-to-Collision (TTC):**
   - Longitudinal TTC = 16.35 m / 1.43 m/s ≈ 11.44 seconds
   - Lateral TTC does not apply due to negligible velocity.

2. **Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC):**
   - The longitudinal MDC is essentially the current adjusted longitudinal distance since the relative velocity is insufficient to close this gap immediately.
   
#### Risk Assessment:
- **Current Risk Level:** With a TTC of approximately 11.44 seconds and considering the obstacle is approaching but still far, the risk level is applicable for a score of 5 – No Risk, as the TTC is well above 5 seconds and MDC exceeds the threshold for negligible risk.

#### Motion Description Consideration:
- The longitudinal alignment with positive distance and the approaching nature in the longitudinal direction with the observed acceleration trend (decreasing) supports that there is no immediate risk of collision.

In conclusion, there are no immediate collision risks or extreme risks associated with Obstacle 30636 in the present scenario based on the detailed assessment. The ego vehicle and obstacle are maintaining a safe distance, and given the relative velocities and trajectories, the situation is stable and under control.
