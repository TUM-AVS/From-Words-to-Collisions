At t=0.9s, the ego vehicle at (-463.7106, -357.1023) and the obstacle 30636.0 at (-455.0684, -338.1163) are in the same lanelet (53.0).  The obstacle is roughly 8.6 meters ahead in the x-direction and 19 meters ahead in the y-direction. While the distance is not extremely close, the obstacle's velocity is decreasing rapidly (successive accelerations of -4.15, -6.43, -6.43) suggesting hard braking.  The ego vehicle, on the other hand, is slightly accelerating. This combination of closing distance and rapidly decelerating lead vehicle suggests a high risk of collision in the very near future, making it an extreme risk.
