At t=0.9s, the ego vehicle at (-463.7106, -357.1023) and the obstacle 30636.0 at (-455.0684, -338.1163) are in the same lanelet (53.0).  The obstacle is roughly 8.6m ahead in the x-direction and 19m ahead in the y-direction. While the obstacle is decelerating rapidly, the ego vehicle is maintaining a relatively constant velocity. Given the distances and the current velocities, a collision is not imminent in the next immediate timestep, but the closing rate warrants attention. The rapid deceleration of the obstacle suggests it might stop or significantly reduce speed soon, increasing the collision risk in the near future if the ego does not react.  Therefore, this represents a high risk but not an extreme risk (requiring immediate, drastic action).

    "Reasoning": "Obstacle 30636.0 is approximately 8.6m ahead and 19m to the side  in the same lane, and decelerating rapidly while ego maintains almost constant velocity.  This is a high risk situation requiring attention but not an immediate collision risk."
