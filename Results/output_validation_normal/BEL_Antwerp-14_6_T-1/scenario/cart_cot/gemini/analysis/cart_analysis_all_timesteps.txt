### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 30636.0
- Distance Risk reason: The obstacle is in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle. At the most recent timestep (0.9 seconds), the obstacle is approximately 11.6 meters ahead of the ego vehicle.  While there's a safe distance currently, analysis of the trajectory over the previous timesteps shows both vehicles moving in the same direction with the obstacle's velocity decreasing more rapidly than the ego vehicle's, which could lead to a risky situation in the near future.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: The obstacle's velocity is decreasing while the ego vehicle maintains a relatively constant velocity.  Examining the trend over the past few timesteps reveals a consistent deceleration pattern for the obstacle, suggesting that the velocity difference between the vehicles will continue to shrink.  This increased proximity combined with the decreasing velocity difference increases the risk of a collision in the near future.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. **Identify the most critical obstacles:** Obstacle 30636.0 is the most critical as it shares the same lanelet as the ego vehicle and is relatively close.
2. **Analyze their trajectories over all 10 timesteps:** Both the ego vehicle and obstacle 30636.0 are moving in roughly the same direction. The obstacle is initially moving faster than the ego vehicle but is decelerating rapidly, while the ego vehicle's velocity remains relatively stable.
3. **Evaluate relative positions, velocities, and accelerations:** The obstacle is ahead of the ego vehicle and the distance between them is decreasing over time as the relative velocities change. Specifically, the obstacle's deceleration suggests it will either slow down considerably or possibly even come to a stop. This creates a risk of the ego vehicle colliding with it if the ego vehicle does not react accordingly.
4. **Determine if any collision has occurred or is imminent:**  No collision has occurred yet. However, given the current trends, a collision is possible if the ego vehicle does not reduce its speed or change lanes.
5. **Explain your reasoning for your conclusion:**  The consistent deceleration of the obstacle, combined with its position in the same lane as the ego vehicle, creates a growing risk of collision. The relative velocities and the history of the obstacle's movement suggest that a collision is a real possibility if evasive action is not taken by the ego vehicle.
