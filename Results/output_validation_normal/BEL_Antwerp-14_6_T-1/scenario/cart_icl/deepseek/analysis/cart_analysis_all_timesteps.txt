### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep:  
Here's the evaluation of the obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:
- **Obstacle ID**: 30636.0  
  - **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle and has been consistently ahead but closing the distance over time. The lateral distance is negligible (same lanelet), and the longitudinal distance is decreasing.  
  - **Distance safety score**: 2 (High Risk)  
  - **Time Risk reason**: The obstacle is decelerating rapidly (acceleration = -6.4355 m/s²), while the ego vehicle is accelerating slightly. The relative velocity is decreasing, but the obstacle is still moving faster than the ego vehicle.  
  - **Time safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk)  
  - **Overall Risk score**: 2 (High Risk)  

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. **Same Lanelet**: Both ego and obstacle are in lanelet 53.0, indicating shared trajectory risk.  
2. **Distance Trend**: The obstacle is ahead but the longitudinal gap is closing (from ~18.6m at 0.1s to ~18.0m at 0.9s).  
3. **Velocity/Acceleration**: Obstacle is decelerating sharply, reducing collision likelihood, but still poses risk due to proximity.  
4. **TTC Estimate**: ~18m / (13.02 m/s - 11.59 m/s) ≈ 12.6s (not imminent, but requires monitoring).  
5. **Conclusion**: No immediate collision, but high risk due to shared lane and closing distance.
