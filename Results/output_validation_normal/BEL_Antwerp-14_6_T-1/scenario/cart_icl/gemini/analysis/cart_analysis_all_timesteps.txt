### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 30636.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 30636.0 is in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle and the distance is decreasing over time. At t=0.9s, the distance is approximately 17 meters.  Positions and orientations suggest a potential rear-end collision if the ego vehicle decelerates significantly or the obstacle maintains its speed.
- Distance safety score: 2
- Time Risk reason: The relative velocity between the ego vehicle and obstacle 30636.0 is relatively small, but obstacle 30636.0 shows a rapid deceleration which could lead to a collision if the ego vehicle does not react accordingly.
- Time safety score: 2
- Overall Risk score: 2

- Obstacle ID: 30639.0
- Distance Risk reason:  Obstacle 30639.0 is in a different lanelet and the distance is relatively large and increasing. The trajectories indicate no immediate risk.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason:  Relative velocity and trajectories indicate no risk of collision in the near future.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5


### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. **Identify potential collisions:** The primary concern is Obstacle 30636.0 which is in the same lane and closing in, posing a rear-end collision risk. Obstacle 30639.0 is in a different lanelet and poses no immediate threat.
2. **Assess relative motion:** Obstacle 30636.0 has been consistently behind the ego vehicle but is decelerating.  The ego vehicle is also moving forward, so a rear-end collision is possible if these trends continue.
3. **Evaluate risk level:**  Given the decreasing distance, same lanelet, and concerning deceleration of obstacle 30636.0, it presents a high risk.
