Obstacle 30636 is moving towards the ego vehicle longitudinally, decreasing the distance between them.  While the latest provided timestep (0.9 seconds) doesn't indicate an immediate collision, the trend suggests a potential collision risk if the relative velocity continues to increase in the negative direction (towards the ego).  More data points beyond 0.9 seconds are needed to definitively assess the risk. The lateral distance remains zero, indicating perfect lateral alignment, which further raises concern.  Therefore, it represents a potential extreme risk, although not yet a confirmed collision.
