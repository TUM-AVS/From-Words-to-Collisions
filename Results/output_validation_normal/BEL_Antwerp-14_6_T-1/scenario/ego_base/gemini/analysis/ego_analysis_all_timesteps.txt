At t=0.9s, obstacle 30636 is in front of the ego vehicle, moving towards it.  The longitudinal distance has decreased to 16.35m, and the relative longitudinal velocity is -1.43 m/s.  Although the obstacle is approaching, it's not an immediate collision risk given the current distance and relative velocity. The lateral distance remains 0, indicating continued alignment with the ego vehicle.  The relative acceleration suggests the obstacle is braking. While this closing motion needs monitoring, it doesn't pose an extreme risk in the immediate next timestep.
