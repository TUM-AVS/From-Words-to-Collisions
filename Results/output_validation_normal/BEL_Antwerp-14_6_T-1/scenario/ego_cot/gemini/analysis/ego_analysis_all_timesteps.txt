### Safety analysis for timestep 0.9 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 30636
- Distance Risk reason: At 0.9 seconds, Obstacle 30636 is 16.35m in front and 16.35 meters lateral to the ego vehicle. While it's moving closer longitudinally, the lateral and longitudinal distances are still significant.  
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason:  The obstacle is approaching longitudinally with negative relative velocity (-1.43 m/s) and negative relative acceleration (-2.72 m/sÂ²). This closing motion warrants attention although the distance is currently safe.  Given the current rate of closure, a precise TTC calculation is complex but it's unlikely to collide within the very near future.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4


### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
    "CollisionObstacle": null,
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null,
    "IsCollisionScenario": false,
    "Justification": "No immediate collision is detected.  Obstacle 30636 is approaching but is still at a safe distance. The scenario requires monitoring, especially the longitudinal closing motion of Obstacle 30636."
