### Obstacle-by-Obstacle Analysis

#### Obstacle 30636 (Most Recent Timestep: 0.9s)
- **Position**: Front of ego car
- **Adjusted Distances**: 
  - Longitudinal: 16.35 m (raw: 16.35 m)
  - Lateral: 0.00 m (raw: 0.00 m)
- **Relative Velocity**: 
  - Longitudinal: -1.43 m/s (approaching ego)
  - Lateral: -0.01 m/s (negligible lateral movement)
- **Relative Acceleration**: 
  - Longitudinal: -2.72 m/s² (decelerating toward ego)
  - Lateral: -5.97 m/s² (negligible lateral acceleration)
- **Motion Description**: Obstacle is driving toward the ego car longitudinally. Exact lateral alignment.

#### Trajectory Analysis (0.1s to 0.9s)
- The obstacle initially moves away from the ego car (longitudinal distance increases from 15.80 m to 16.53 m at 0.7s).
- At 0.7s, the relative velocity becomes negative (-0.10 m/s), indicating the obstacle starts approaching the ego car.
- The approach accelerates (relative velocity becomes more negative: -0.77 m/s at 0.8s, -1.43 m/s at 0.9s).
- Lateral distance remains 0.00 m throughout, indicating perfect alignment.

#### Time-to-Collision (TTC)
- **Longitudinal TTC**: 
  - Distance: 16.35 m
  - Relative Velocity: 1.43 m/s (absolute value, since obstacle is approaching)
  - TTC = 16.35 / 1.43 ≈ 11.43 seconds
  - Risk Score: 5 (No Risk, TTC > 5.0s)
- **Lateral TTC**: 
  - Distance: 0.00 m (but no lateral movement)
  - Relative Velocity: 0.01 m/s (negligible)
  - TTC is not applicable (no lateral collision risk).

#### Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC)
- **Longitudinal MDC**: 16.35 m (no lateral movement, so MDC is longitudinal distance)
- Risk Score: 5 (No Risk, MDC > 5.0m)

#### Overall Risk Assessment
- The obstacle is longitudinally aligned and approaching the ego car, but the distance is large (16.35 m) and the TTC is high (11.43 s). 
- Lateral alignment is exact (0.00 m), but there is no lateral movement or risk.
- **Overall Risk Score**: 5 (No Risk)

### Conclusion
- No collision or extreme risk is observed. The obstacle is approaching but is still far away with a high TTC.
- This is **not** a collision scenario.
