Obstacle 30636 Analysis:

Trajectory Analysis:
- Over the past 0.9 seconds, Obstacle 30636 has been in front of the ego vehicle.
- Initially, it was moving away longitudinally (increasing distance), but starting around 0.7 seconds, the longitudinal velocity became negative, indicating movement towards the ego vehicle. 
- Lateral distance remains consistently at 0.00m indicating perfect lateral alignment.

Most Recent Timestep (0.9 seconds):
- Longitudinal distance: 16.35 m
- Lateral distance: 0.00 m
- Relative longitudinal velocity: -1.43 m/s (approaching)
- Relative lateral velocity: -0.01 m/s (slightly diverging)

TTC Calculation:
- Longitudinal TTC = 16.35 m / |-1.43 m/s| â‰ˆ 11.43 seconds

MDC Calculation:
- Since the obstacle is directly in front, and the lateral distance is 0.00m, MDC can be considered as the longitudinal distance, but with the trajectory analysis taken into account.

Risk Assessment:
- Longitudinal Risk: With a TTC of > 5.0 seconds, and the obstacle currently quite far away (16.35m), the longitudinal risk is classified as 5 (No Risk).
- Lateral Risk: Although the lateral distance is 0, the obstacle's trajectory shows it's very slightly diverging, which makes a lateral collision unlikely. However, the perfect lateral alignment means the situation should be closely monitored.  As such, the lateral risk is 5 (No Risk), but awareness must be maintained in case lateral divergence increases.

Overall Risk: 5 (No Risk). Since both TTC and MDC indicate no immediate risk based on the current snapshot and immediate trajectories, the overall risk for this obstacle is classified as "No Risk," even though the lateral distance is 0.00m.  However, continuous monitoring of lateral movement is still recommended.


Collision Scenario Determination:
No. Obstacle 30636 is assessed as "No Risk" (risk score 5) at the most recent timestep, so this situation does not meet the criteria to be flagged as a collision scenario.
