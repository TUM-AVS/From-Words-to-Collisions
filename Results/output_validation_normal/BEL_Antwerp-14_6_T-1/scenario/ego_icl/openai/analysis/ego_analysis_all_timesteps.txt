### Obstacle-by-Obstacle Analysis

**Obstacle 30636 Analysis:**

**Trajectory Analysis:**
- **At 0.9 seconds:** The obstacle is observed at a longitudinal distance of 16.35 meters and a lateral distance of 0.00 meters directly in front of the ego vehicle.
- The relative velocity at this point is -1.43 m/s longitudinally, indicating the obstacle is closing the gap and moving toward the ego vehicle.
- The obstacle has a negative relative acceleration, further contributing to a closing trajectory.
- From the trajectory analysis over the timesteps, the obstacle initially moved away but began converging on the ego vehicle starting around 0.7 seconds, becoming more pronounced by 0.9 seconds.

**TTC and MDC Calculations:**
- **Time-to-Collision (TTC):**
  \( \text{TTC}_{longitudinal} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{|\text{Relative Velocity}|} = \frac{16.35\,m}{1.43\,m/s} \approx 11.43\,s \)
  - Note: The actual TTC is much larger than the 5-second threshold for collision risk due to increasing distance at initial timesteps.
  
- **Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC):** Considering the relative motion and alignment:
  - Given its course, exact alignment in lateral direction (0.00m) would not automatically result in collision without further reductions in longitudinal distance or increased relative velocity.
  - Since the adjusted distances take into account vehicle sizes, let's assume they maintain a minimum clearance typically under 5.0 meters.

**Risk Assessment:**
- **TTC Evaluation:** TTC is calculated to be greater than 5 seconds; however, note that it is a simplified static calculation since real dynamics can alter.
- **MDC Evaluation:** Continuously increasing longitudinal distance initially, then closing and aligning laterally suggest a comparative urgency.
- **Risk Score:** Given the long TTC in a present context but a converging trajectory influenced by the negative velocity and acceleration, a **Medium Risk (3)** is reasonable. However, still above collision likelihood (scores 1 or 0).

### Conclusion
- **Determination:** From the combined longitudinal movement and near-zero lateral deviation, although it aligns perfectly over time in one incidence, it strictly doesn't present an immediate threat based on dynamic results in less intense scores (>2). Scenarios knock chances as a critical failure with our risk rating methods.
