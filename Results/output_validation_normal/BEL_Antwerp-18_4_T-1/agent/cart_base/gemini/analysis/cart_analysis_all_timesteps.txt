The ego vehicle and obstacle 30738 are in the same lanelet (393). The obstacle's velocity is decreasing rapidly and becomes 0 at t=0.8s.  The ego vehicle is approaching the obstacle from behind, and though its velocity is also decreasing, it's still significantly higher than the obstacle's. The y-coordinates suggest the ego vehicle is getting closer to the obstacle over time. While a collision hasn't happened within the first 0.9 seconds, the continuous approach and the significant difference in y-coordinate combined with decreasing velocities suggest a high risk of collision in the near future.  We need more future timesteps to definitively confirm a collision, but the trend indicates a risk level higher than 'Medium'.  Given the information available, assigning a 'High Risk' is the most appropriate assessment.
