At t=0.9s, the ego vehicle is at (-77.9527, -145.6978) with a velocity of 4.7438 and the obstacle is at (-76.4769, -160.8176) with a velocity of 0. The obstacle appears to be stationary.

**Calculations and Reasoning:**

1. **Longitudinal Distance and TTC:** The longitudinal distance is approximately 15.12 meters (|-145.6978 - (-160.8176)|).  Since the obstacle is stationary and the ego vehicle is moving towards it (albeit slowing down), the longitudinal TTC is non-zero but needs further analysis with more future timesteps to determine the exact value and the associated risk.

2. **Lateral Distance and TTC:** The lateral distance is approximately 1.4758 meters (|-77.9527 - (-76.4769)|). This is a small lateral distance. Considering the ego vehicle's orientation and the lanelet information (both in lanelet 393), it suggests they are likely on a collision course if the ego vehicle doesn't change lanes or decelerate significantly. Since the obstacle is stationary, a lateral collision seems imminent if the ego vehicle continues on its current path.

3. **Minimum Distance Calculation (MDC):**  MDC at t=0.9s is approximately sqrt((1.4758)^2 + (15.12)^2) = ~15.19 meters.  Although the MDC itself isn't extremely small, the combination of lateral distance, ego vehicle's velocity, and the obstacle's stationary nature makes this a very high-risk situation.

4. **Prediction:** Given the current trajectories and velocities, a collision is highly probable within the next few timesteps. The ego vehicle is approaching the stationary obstacle rapidly and the lateral distance is already small.

Based on the analysis:

* **Position:** The lateral distance is very small.
* **Velocity:** The ego vehicle is moving at a moderate speed towards the stationary obstacle.
* **Acceleration:** The ego vehicle is decelerating, but not enough to avoid a likely collision given the current positions and velocities.

Given the minimal lateral separation and the ego vehicle's continued movement towards the stationary obstacle, a collision is highly likely.  The obstacle is predicted as a collision obstacle (risk score 0) due to its stationary nature in the direct path of the ego vehicle which, at it's current rate of deceleration, will not be able to stop in time before colliding with the obstacle.
