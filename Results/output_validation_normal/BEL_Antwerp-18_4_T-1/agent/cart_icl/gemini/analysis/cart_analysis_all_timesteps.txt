At t=0.9s, the ego vehicle at (-77.95, -145.70) is moving with a velocity of 4.74 m/s and decelerating at -1.08 m/sÂ². The obstacle (ID: 30738) is stationary at (-76.48, -160.82).  The lateral distance is approximately 15 meters, and the longitudinal distance is approximately 1.5 meters.  Since the obstacle is stationary and the ego vehicle is decelerating, the risk of collision is low. The substantial lateral distance further reduces the risk. Although they are in the same lanelet, the ego's deceleration suggests an attempt to avoid the obstacle.

Calculating a precise TTC is difficult without more information on the ego vehicle's future trajectory. However, given the ego's deceleration and the obstacle's stationary position, a collision is unlikely.  Therefore, while there is some risk due to proximity, the risk is not extreme or high.
