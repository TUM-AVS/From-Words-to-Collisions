Let's analyze the scenario to evaluate potential collision risks.

### Ego Vehicle Analysis (Latest Timestep at 0.9 seconds):
- Position: (-77.9527, -145.6978)
- Velocity: 4.7438 m/s
- Orientation: -1.4767 radians
- Lanelet: 393.0

### Obstacle Analysis (Latest Timestep at 0.9 seconds):
- Obstacle ID: 30738.0
- Position: (-76.4769, -160.8176)
- Velocity: 0.0 m/s (stationary)
- Orientation: -1.4726 radians
- Lanelet: 393.0

### Relative Position and Motion:
- **Relative Longitudinal Position:** Ego is approximately 15.12 m ahead of the obstacle.
- **Relative Lateral Position:** Since both vehicles are on the same lanelet and given the x-coordinate difference, there is no significant lateral offset.
- **Relative Velocity:** Ego is moving at 4.7438 m/s, while the obstacle is stationary.

### Time to Collision (TTC) and Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC):
- **TTC Calculation:** Since the obstacle is stationary and the ego is moving away, there is no risk of collision unless the ego abruptly changes speed/direction. Thus, TTC is effectively infinite for collision.
- **MDC:** Minimum distance currently is 15.12 m, which indicates a safe separation between the ego vehicle and the stationary obstacle.

### Risk Assessment:
Given the position, velocity, and orientation of the vehicles, and considering that the obstacle is stationary:

- **Position:** There is a significant longitudinal gap, with no lateral offset.
- **Velocity & Acceleration:** The obstacle has zero velocity and is decelerating to complete rest, posing no immediate threat.
- **Environment:** Both entities are on the same lanelet, but they maintain a substantial distance from each other. The ego's trajectory shows it's moving further away from the obstacle.

The obstacle does not pose any immediate risk of collision with the ego vehicle. Its stationary status and the existing separation provide a buffer for safe navigational adjustments.

Given this context, none of the obstacles qualify for a Collision (0) or Extreme Risk (1) level rating.
