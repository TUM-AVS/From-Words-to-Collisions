At t=0.9s, obstacle 30738 is located 10.68m in front of the ego vehicle and perfectly aligned laterally.  It is approaching the ego vehicle with a longitudinal velocity of -4.74 m/s. While the relative acceleration is positive at 0.10 m/sÂ², the current velocity and proximity suggest a high risk of collision if the obstacle and ego maintain their current trajectories.  Therefore, obstacle 30738 is classified as a high-risk obstacle.
