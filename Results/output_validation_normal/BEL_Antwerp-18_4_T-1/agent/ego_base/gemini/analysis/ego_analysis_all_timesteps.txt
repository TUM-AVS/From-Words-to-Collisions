At t=0.9s, obstacle 30738 is 10.68m in front of the ego vehicle, laterally aligned (0.00m).  The relative longitudinal velocity is -4.74 m/s, indicating the obstacle is approaching the ego vehicle. While the distance is decreasing, the rate of closure is slightly lower than previous timesteps. Given the 10.68m distance and closing speed, there is still time to react, placing this in a medium-risk category at this specific moment. However, continuous monitoring is crucial as the situation could quickly escalate.
