### Safety analysis for timestep 0.9s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:
- **Obstacle ID:** 30738
- **Distance Risk reason:** At 0.9 seconds, the obstacle is 10.68m longitudinally and laterally away from the ego vehicle. While this might seem like a safe distance, the consistent closing velocity observed throughout the previous timesteps indicates a rapidly decreasing separation. The lateral movement also appears to be converging towards the ego vehicle's path.  The provided context states that the obstacle is "in the Front of the ego car," further emphasizing the potential for a collision if the current trajectories are maintained.
- **Distance safety score:** 3 (Medium Risk)
- **Time Risk reason:**  Although precise TTC values aren't calculable without more precise acceleration data, the relatively high closing velocity (-4.74 m/s longitudinally and 0.00 m/s laterally) coupled with decreasing longitudinal separation across the timesteps strongly suggests a short TTC. The lateral velocity fluctuating around zero is concerning as it indicates potentially unpredictable lateral movement.  
- **Time safety score:** 2 (High Risk)
- **Overall Risk score:** 2 (High Risk)
