### Obstacle Analysis: Obstacle 30738

#### Trajectory Analysis:
- **Direction**: Front of the ego car (longitudinal alignment)
- **Motion**: The obstacle is driving toward the ego car longitudinally with a consistent closing velocity (~4.5 m/s). The lateral distance is 0.00 m, indicating exact lateral alignment (same lane).
- **Longitudinal Distance (adjusted)**: Decreasing from 14.77 m to 10.68 m over 0.9 seconds.
- **Lateral Distance (adjusted)**: 0.00 m (constant, exact alignment).
- **Relative Velocity (longitudinal)**: -4.74 m/s (closing).
- **Relative Velocity (lateral)**: 0.00 m/s (no lateral movement).
- **Relative Acceleration (longitudinal)**: 0.10 m/s² (slight deceleration in closing speed).
- **Relative Acceleration (lateral)**: -1.08 m/s² (no significant lateral change).

#### Time-to-Collision (TTC):
- **TTC (longitudinal)**: Distance / |Relative Velocity| = 10.68 m / 4.74 m/s ≈ **2.25 seconds**.
- **TTC (lateral)**: Not applicable (no lateral movement).

#### Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC):
- Since the obstacle is longitudinally aligned (lateral = 0.00 m), the MDC is the longitudinal distance: **10.68 m**.

#### Risk Assessment:
- **TTC (2.25 s)**: Medium Risk (1.0 < TTC ≤ 3.0 s).
- **MDC (10.68 m)**: No Risk (MDC > 5.0 m).
- **Overall Risk**: Prioritize the higher risk (Medium Risk, score 3).

#### Reasoning:
- The obstacle is in the same lane and closing longitudinally, but the distance is still large (10.68 m) and the TTC is manageable (2.25 s). No immediate collision risk, but the ego vehicle should monitor the situation.
