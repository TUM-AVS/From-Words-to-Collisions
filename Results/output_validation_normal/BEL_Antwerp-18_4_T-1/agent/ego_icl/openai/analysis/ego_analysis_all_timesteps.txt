### Obstacle Analysis

**Obstacle 30738:**
- **Position and movement:** At the most recent timestep (0.9 seconds), Obstacle 30738 is directly in front of the ego vehicle with an adjusted longitudinal distance of 10.68 m and a lateral distance of 0.00 m. It is moving mostly in the longitudinal direction towards the ego vehicle with a relative velocity of -4.74 m/s longitudinally.

- **Trajectory analysis:**
  - From 0.0 to 0.9 seconds, the obstacle has been moving closer to the ego vehicle at a decreasing longitudinal distance with consistent negative relative velocity, indicating it is approaching the ego vehicle.

- **Time-to-Collision (TTC):**
  - Calculate TTC using the longitudinal distance and relative velocity:
  \[
  \text{TTC} = \frac{10.68 \text{ m}}{4.74 \text{ m/s}} \approx 2.25 \text{ seconds}
  \]
  This TTC indicates a medium risk, as it is between 1.0 and 3.0 seconds.

- **Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC):**
  - Since the lateral distance is 0.00 m (indicating same-lane alignment) and the longitudinal distance is 10.68 m, the MDC is the longitudinal distance of 10.68 m. This is well above 5.0 m, indicating a negligible risk according to MDC.

- **Risk assessment:**
  - Despite the negligible risk indicated by MDC, the TTC indicates a medium risk due to the relatively short time until potential collision, given the continued approach of the obstacle.
  - The obstacle is on the same trajectory, with a closing velocity that necessitates monitoring and potential evasive action.

- **Final Risk Score:** Medium risk is prioritized due to the TTC assessment, placing the obstacle at risk level 3.
