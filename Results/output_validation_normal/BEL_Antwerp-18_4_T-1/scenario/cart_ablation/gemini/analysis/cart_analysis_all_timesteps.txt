At t=0.9s, the ego vehicle at (-77.95, -145.70) is moving with a velocity of 4.74 m/s and the obstacle (ID 30738.0) is stationary at (-76.48, -160.82).  The obstacle has stopped moving as of t=0.8s.  While the y-coordinates suggest a significant separation, the x-coordinates show a difference of only ~1.5m. Given the ego vehicle's continued motion, a collision is highly probable in the next few timesteps unless the ego vehicle significantly alters its trajectory or brakes heavily.  Therefore, this is considered an extreme risk.
