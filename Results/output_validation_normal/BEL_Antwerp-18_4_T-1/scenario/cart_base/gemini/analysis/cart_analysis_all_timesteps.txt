At t=0.9s, the ego vehicle at (-77.95, -145.70) and the obstacle 30738.0 is stationary at (-76.48, -160.82).  The obstacle is approximately 15 meters behind the ego vehicle and slightly to its right.  While the distance is not extremely small, the obstacle's stationary nature and the ego vehicle's continuous movement in the same lanelet (393.0) with a still significant speed (4.74 m/s) suggest the ego vehicle is approaching the obstacle, raising concerns about a potential collision if the ego doesn't decelerate or change lanes soon. Given the rate of deceleration of the ego vehicle in previous timesteps, braking might not be sufficient to avoid a collision in the very near future (next few seconds). Thus, an extreme risk level is assigned.
