### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 30738.0
- Distance Risk reason: The obstacle is in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle and, while it is some distance ahead, the ego vehicle is approaching it at a faster rate initially.  Over the provided timesteps, the relative longitudinal distance decreases, and the obstacle comes to a stop.  Although the final positions suggest no immediate collision, the history indicates a need to monitor closely.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: While the ego vehicle's velocity is initially much higher than the obstacle's, it is decelerating. The obstacle's deceleration is also significant, and it eventually stops. The trend suggests a decreasing TTC, increasing risk if both vehicles maintain their current behavior.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. **Most critical obstacle:** Obstacle 30738.0 is the only obstacle identified and is in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle.
2. **Trajectory analysis:** The ego vehicle is approaching the obstacle from behind. The obstacle starts at (-76.5651, -159.9221) and ends at (-76.4769, -160.8176), with a clear deceleration trend until it stops.  The ego vehicle moves from (-78.6092, -139.9843) to (-77.9527, -145.6978), also decelerating throughout.
3. **Relative position, velocity, and acceleration:** The relative longitudinal distance decreases over the timesteps. Initially, the ego vehicle's velocity is much higher, but its deceleration reduces the velocity difference over time.  Both vehicles have negative acceleration, with the obstacle eventually stopping.
4. **Collision determination:**  Based on the provided data, a collision hasn't occurred within the 0.9-second timeframe.  However, extrapolation beyond this time is not possible with the given information.  A collision *could* occur if the ego vehicle does not decelerate enough.
5. **Reasoning:** The decreasing relative distance combined with the initial velocity difference suggests a medium risk.  The decelerations complicate the analysis but improve safety.  Continued monitoring is required.  There's insufficient data to definitively declare a collision or rule one out beyond the provided snapshot. The risk is heavily dependent on future ego vehicle actions.

{
  "CollisionObstacles": null,
  "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null,
  "ScenarioAnalysis": {
    "IsCollisionScenario": false,
    "Reasoning": "No collision has occurred within the 0.9-second timeframe. While the ego vehicle is approaching the stationary obstacle, the continuous deceleration of the ego vehicle suggests a medium risk level but not imminent collision based on the available data. Further data points beyond 0.9 seconds are necessary to definitively confirm or rule out a future collision."
