### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep:
Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:
- **Obstacle ID**: 30738.0  
  - **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is stationary at (-76.4769, -160.8176) while the ego vehicle is at (-77.9527, -145.6978). The distance between them is ~15.12 units (Euclidean distance), which is significant and increasing over time as the ego moves away.  
  - **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)  
  - **Time Risk reason**: The obstacle has decelerated to a stop (velocity = 0) and is no longer moving. The ego vehicle is moving away from the obstacle (relative velocity is positive).  
  - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)  
  - **Overall Risk score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)  

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. **Obstacle Trajectory**: The obstacle (30738.0) was decelerating heavily over the timesteps and came to a complete stop at the last timestep.  
2. **Ego Trajectory**: The ego vehicle is moving away from the obstacle, with a consistent negative acceleration (braking) but still maintaining forward motion.  
3. **Relative Motion**: The distance between the ego and the obstacle is increasing, and the obstacle is no longer a threat.  
4. **Conclusion**: No collision risk exists at the current or future timesteps.
