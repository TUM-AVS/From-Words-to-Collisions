### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 30738.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 30738.0 is in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle and its y-coordinate is getting closer over time, though it appears to be stopping.  The x-coordinates are relatively similar.
- Distance safety score: 2
- Time Risk reason: The obstacle's velocity is decreasing and reaches zero in the most recent timestep.  The ego vehicle is still moving, but decelerating.
- Time safety score: 2
- Overall Risk score: 2

- Obstacle ID: 30739.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 30739.0 is in a different lanelet and its position is far from the ego vehicle.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason:  The obstacle's trajectory does not intersect with the ego vehicle's based on current data.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5


### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. At the last timestep, Obstacle 30738 is in the same lane and relatively close to the ego vehicle (y-coordinate difference ~15), posing a risk. 
2. Obstacle 30738 velocity is 0 at the last timestep.
3. Ego vehicle is decelerating.
4. Obstacle 30739 is far and in a different lanelet; it poses no immediate risk.
5. This is not a collision scenario at the last timestep since Obstacle 30738 has stopped, however, the next few timesteps are critical depending on the ego vehicle deceleration and if obstacle 30738.0 remains stationary.
