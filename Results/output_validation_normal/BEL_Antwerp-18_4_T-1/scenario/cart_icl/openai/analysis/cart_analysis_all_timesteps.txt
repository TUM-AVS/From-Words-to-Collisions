### Obstacle Analysis:

#### Obstacle ID: 30738
- **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle. The relative position has become very close, with a minimal change in the latitudinal and longitudinal orientations. The obstacle is effectively stationary relative to the ego, increasing risk.
- **Distance safety score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)
- **Time Risk reason**: Over the past timesteps, the obstacle slowed to a complete stop, moving into a stationary position directly in the path of the ego. The relative velocity has approached zero, providing virtually no time for avoidance.
- **Time safety score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)
- **Overall Risk score**: 1

#### Obstacle ID: 30739
- **Distance Risk reason**: This obstacle is in a different lanelet and has consistently maintained a large distance from the ego vehicle. Their paths are parallel, and there is no past movement indicating crossing of paths.
- **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- **Time Risk reason**: The velocities and positions indicate this obstacle is moving on a separate trajectory with a stable speed and orientation consistent with staying away from the ego's path.
- **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
The analysis focuses on determining collision risks with the ego vehicle. Obstacle 30738 poses an extreme risk due to its stationary position in the same lanelet as the ego, effectively closer due to the stopping. This increases the likelihood of impact. Obstacle 30739 is on a different trajectory and maintains distance, thus posing no risk of collision.

        "IsCollisionScenario": false,
        "Reasoning": "While Obstacle 30738 poses an extreme risk due to stationary position and location in the same lanelet, it does not yet render a collision scenario as there is still potential for the ego to take evasive actions. Obstacle 30739 poses no collision risk."
