Obstacle 30738 is approaching the ego vehicle head-on with a decreasing longitudinal distance over each timestep. At the last timestep (0.9 seconds), the obstacle is only 10.68 meters away and closing at a relative longitudinal speed of -4.74 m/s. While the lateral velocity is momentarily zero, the history suggests fluctuating lateral movement. Given the short distance and closing speed, a collision is highly likely if the current motion continues.
