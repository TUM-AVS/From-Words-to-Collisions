At t=0.9s, obstacle 30738 is 10.68m in front of the ego vehicle and directly ahead (lateral distance 0.0m).  It is approaching the ego vehicle with a longitudinal relative velocity of -4.74 m/s. While the relative longitudinal acceleration is positive (0.10 m/sÂ²), indicating some deceleration of the obstacle or acceleration of the ego vehicle, the closing speed and proximity still represent a significant risk. The lateral relative velocity is 0.0 m/s suggesting no immediate lateral movement. However, given the short distance and closing speed, this situation demands close monitoring.

        "Reasoning": "Obstacle 30738 poses an extreme risk due to its proximity (10.68m), closing speed (-4.74 m/s), and position directly in front of the ego vehicle. While not an immediate collision, the risk is very high without prompt action."
