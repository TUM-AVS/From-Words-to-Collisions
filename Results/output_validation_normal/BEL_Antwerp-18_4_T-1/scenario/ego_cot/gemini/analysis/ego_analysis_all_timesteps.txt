### Safety analysis for timestep 0.9s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 30738
- Distance Risk reason: At 0.9 seconds, Obstacle 30738 is 10.68m in front and 10.68m lateral distance from the ego vehicle. While not immediately close, the consistent closing velocity observed in previous timesteps indicates a rapidly decreasing distance. The "exact lateral alignment or unknown case" description also raises concern about a potential lateral collision risk, especially given the fluctuating lateral acceleration observed previously.
- Distance safety score: 3 (Medium Risk)
- Time Risk reason:  A constant negative longitudinal velocity means the obstacle is moving towards the ego vehicle. Assuming constant velocity, a rough TTC calculation (10.68m / 4.74m/s) yields approximately 2.25 seconds. This is a relatively short time, suggesting a high risk of collision if the current trajectories persist. The fluctuating lateral velocity and acceleration adds complexity to predicting the lateral TTC, but the near zero lateral velocity at this timestep gives a cause for concern.
- Time safety score: 2 (High Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 2 (High Risk)


### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
  "CollisionObstacle": null,
  "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {
    "ObstacleID": "30738",
    "OverallRiskScore": "2"
  },
  "IsCollisionScenario": false,
  "Justification": "While not an immediate collision, obstacle 30738 poses a high risk due to its closing velocity and proximity to the ego vehicle.  The calculated TTC of ~2.25 seconds indicates a high probability of collision if no evasive action is taken.  Although the lateral distance is significant at this moment, the uncertainty around its lateral motion and the previous fluctuations in lateral velocity and acceleration need careful monitoring and increase the risk level."
