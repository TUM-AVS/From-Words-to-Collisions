Obstacle 30738 Analysis:

Trajectory Analysis: Obstacle 30738 has been consistently in front of the ego vehicle and approaching throughout all timesteps.  The lateral distance remains at 0.00 m indicating perfect longitudinal alignment. The longitudinal distance is steadily decreasing, indicating a closing situation.

At t=0.9s:

- Longitudinal distance: 10.68 m
- Lateral distance: 0.00 m
- Longitudinal relative velocity: -4.74 m/s (approaching)
- Lateral relative velocity: 0.00 m/s

TTC Calculation:

- Longitudinal TTC = 10.68 m / 4.74 m/s = 2.25 seconds

MDC Calculation:

- Since the obstacle is directly in front and there's perfect lateral alignment (0.00m lateral distance), MDC is essentially governed by the longitudinal distance and closing velocity.  
- Using the longitudinal distance as a proxy for MDC: 10.68m.

Risk Assessment:

- Longitudinal Risk (based on TTC): Medium Risk (3) - TTC is 2.25s (between 1.0 and 3.0 seconds).
- Overall Risk:  Medium Risk (3).


Collision Scenario Determination:

No obstacle has a risk score of 0 or 1. Therefore, this is NOT a collision scenario.
