Let's analyze the given scenario focusing on Obstacle 30738 at the most recent timestep (0.9 seconds):

**Obstacle 30738 Analysis:**

1. **Position and Movement:**
   - Relative Direction: Front
   - Adjusted Longitudinal Distance: Not provided (assumed similar to raw 10.68 m, recalculated if otherwise given)
   - Relative Longitudinal Velocity: -4.74 m/s (approaching fast)
   - Longitudinal Acceleration: 0.10 m/s² (deceleration slowing)
   - Lateral Distance: 0.00 m (exact alignment)
   - Motion: Obstacle is driving toward the ego car longitudinally
   
2. **Trajectory Analysis:**
   - **Velocity and Distance Change over Time:**
     - Last recorded adjusted distances show a consistent decrease in longitudinal distance indicating a rapid approach.
     - Given deceleration is minor, noting minimal effect on the quick approach.

3. **Time-to-Collision (TTC):**
   - Longitudinal TTC = Longitudinal Distance / |Relative Longitudinal Velocity|
   - TTC = 10.68 m / 4.74 m/s = 2.25 seconds

4. **Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC):**
   - With precise lateral alignment, the critical MDC is linguistic and determined by reviewing trajectories in the longitudinal direction. Longitudinal MDC mirrors lateral proximity.
   - Potentially reducing close to dangerous proximity given trajectory convergence.

5. **Risk Assessment:**
   - Longitudinal TTC assessment offers a **Medium Risk** score (3) as it’s 2.25 s.
   - Overall convergence paths and consistent, determined approach signal increasing risk.

**Conclusion**:
- Despite a "Medium Risk" TTC score (3), concern remains high with decreasing trends in proximity.
- With calculated dynamics, the logic framework requires comprehensive alignment.
- No Extreme Risk (1) or Collision (0) situations noted.

  "CollisionObstacle": {
      "ObstacleID": "None",
      "OverallRiskScore": "None"
  },
  "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {
      "ObstacleID": "None",
      "OverallRiskScore": "None"
  },
  "IsCollisionScenario": false,
  "Justification": "The obstacle does not present an immediate collision risk, with a Longitudinal TTC of 2.25 seconds indicating medium risk, thus not qualifying for Extreme or Collision Risk scoring."
