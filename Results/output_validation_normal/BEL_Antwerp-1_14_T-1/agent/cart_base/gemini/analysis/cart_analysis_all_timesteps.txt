Here's the analysis and the JSON output:

**Analysis:**

The Ego vehicle's y-coordinate decreases over time, indicating it's moving roughly south.  Let's examine the closest obstacles:

* **Obstacle 30755:** This obstacle starts relatively close to the Ego vehicle and also moves south (decreasing y-coordinate). However, its x-coordinate is significantly greater than the Ego vehicle's, suggesting it's in a neighboring lane and moving parallel to the Ego vehicle. While proximity should be monitored, the current trajectories don't indicate an immediate collision risk.

* **Obstacle 30756:**  This obstacle is positioned to the west (negative x-coordinate) of the Ego vehicle and also moving south. Its y-coordinate decreases at a rate closer to the Ego vehicle's, which merits closer observation, but it is not currently presenting a high collision risk.

* **Obstacle 30762:** This obstacle starts near the Ego vehicle in y-coordinate and moves south.  Its x-coordinate is also close to the Ego vehicle. This obstacle presents the most significant risk of collision in the near future, as the vehicles' trajectories seem to be converging. It would classify as a high risk obstacle.

* **Obstacle 30768:** This obstacle is significantly south (lower y-coordinate) and west (negative x-coordinate) and poses no immediate threat.
