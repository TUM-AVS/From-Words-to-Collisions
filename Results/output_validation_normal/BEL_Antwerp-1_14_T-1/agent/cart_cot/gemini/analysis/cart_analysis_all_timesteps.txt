Here's a collision risk analysis of the provided scenario focusing on the last timestep (0.9 seconds), utilizing previous timesteps to inform predictions:

**Ego Vehicle State (at t=0.9s):**

* Position: (1.8164, -176.0908)
* Velocity: 4.3984 (Units unclear, assumed m/s)
* Acceleration: -0.2676 (Units unclear, assumed m/s^2)

**Obstacles Analysis (at t=0.9s and projected):**

* **Obstacle 30755.0:** Position (11.69, -162.1592), Velocity 8.7178, Acceleration 0.4342. This obstacle is relatively far from the ego vehicle and moving in a parallel direction but further along the Y-axis (north relative to ego if using a standard coordinate system).  Given the current trajectories, a collision is unlikely. *Risk Score: 5*

* **Obstacle 30756.0:** Position (-2.4625, -190.8527), Velocity 1.7517, Acceleration -4.7398. This obstacle is positioned behind and to the left of the ego vehicle. The negative acceleration suggests it's slowing down which reduces risk. *Risk Score: 4*

* **Obstacle 30759.0:** Position (29.4673, -178.3663), Velocity 9.692, Acceleration -0.0829. This obstacle is far ahead and slightly to the right of the ego vehicle and moving faster.  The distance and different lanes suggest low risk. *Risk Score: 5*

* **Obstacle 30762.0:** Position (6.7351, -177.3493), Velocity 6.4294, Acceleration 1.1701. This obstacle is moderately close to the ego vehicle and accelerating. This represents a potential risk if the ego vehicle continues decelerating. *Risk Score: 3*

* **Obstacle 30763.0:** Position (9.1499, -189.076), Velocity 3.5349, Acceleration -3.8427.  This obstacle is behind the ego vehicle and moderately to the right. It's decelerating significantly, meaning a collision is unlikely. *Risk Score: 5*

* **Obstacle 30764.0:** Position (14.0514, -199.166), Velocity 3.7304, Acceleration -1.2823. Located behind and significantly to the right of the ego, this obstacle's deceleration makes collision improbable. *Risk Score: 5*

* **Obstacle 30768.0:** Position (-6.8142, -199.6809), Velocity 3.2115, Acceleration -1.9576. Situated behind and to the left of the ego vehicle, this obstacle poses little risk due to its distance, lane position, and deceleration. *Risk Score: 5*
