At t=0.9s, the ego vehicle (ID 30758) is at (1.8164, -176.0908) with a velocity of 4.3984 m/s. Let's analyze the risk posed by each obstacle:

* **Obstacle 30755:** Located at (11.69, -162.1592), this obstacle is significantly further north and slightly east of the ego vehicle.  Given the trajectories and lanelets, there is no immediate risk. Risk: **Negligible (5)**

* **Obstacle 30756:** Located at (-1.843, -189.5876). This obstacle is south and west of the ego vehicle and in a different lanelet.  The lateral distance is significant and there's no evident risk. Risk: **Negligible (5)**

* **Obstacle 30759:**  Located at (29.4673, -178.3663). Although quite far east, this obstacle is nearly at the same y-coordinate as the ego vehicle. This warrants attention as their paths might intersect soon. However, considering its current distance, a collision isn't imminent. Risk: **Low (4)**

* **Obstacle 30762:** Located at (6.7351, -177.3493).  Relatively close to the ego vehicle and slightly north.  Requires monitoring but no immediate danger. Risk: **Medium (3)**

* **Obstacle 30763:** Located at (9.1499, -189.076).  South of the ego vehicle with a safe lateral distance. No immediate risk. Risk: **Negligible (5)**

* **Obstacle 30764:** Located at (14.0514, -199.166).  Far south of the ego vehicle and moving in different lanelet.  No immediate risk. Risk: **Negligible (5)**

* **Obstacle 30768:** Located at (-6.8142, -199.6809). Significantly south and west of the ego vehicle, posing no immediate risk. Risk: **Negligible (5)**
