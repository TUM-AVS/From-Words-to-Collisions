At time 0.9s, all obstacles are moving away from the ego vehicle longitudinally.  While some obstacles exhibit lateral movement towards the ego vehicle, their distances and relative velocities suggest they pose no immediate collision risk. Specifically, obstacle 30762 is the closest laterally, but at -3.33m, it is not a high risk.  Therefore, there are no obstacles classified as collision, extreme risk, or high risk.
