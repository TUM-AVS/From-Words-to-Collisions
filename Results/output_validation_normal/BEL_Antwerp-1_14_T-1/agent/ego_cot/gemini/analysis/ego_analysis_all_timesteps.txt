### Safety analysis for timestep 0.9s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

**Assumptions and Clarifications:**

* Since the provided scenario lacks ego vehicle and obstacle dimensions, and the prompt explicitly instructs to use *adjusted* distances, I'm assuming `adjusted_d_long` and `adjusted_d_lat` are equal to the provided  `DTClong` and `DTClat` respectively.  This analysis would be significantly improved with actual adjusted distances.
* TTC calculation:  TTC = Distance / Relative Velocity.  If Relative Velocity is zero or moving away, TTC is considered infinite (represented as "inf").  We'll analyze the trend across timesteps to determine risk if relative velocity is low or changes direction.
* A negative TTC value indicates that either a collision has occurred or the object is moving away from the ego vehicle.
* Lateral movement is evaluated for risk, understanding that lateral distance alone doesn't define a collision in the same way longitudinal distance does.
* Overall risk is determined by considering the combined risk of longitudinal and lateral movement. The minimum of the calculated risk of longitudinal and lateral movements is taken as the Overall Risk Score for simplicity and safety.


### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 30755**
- Distance Risk reason: Large positive DTClong (9.60m) and DTClat (9.60m) and located front-right.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Moving away longitudinally and laterally.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 30756**
- Distance Risk reason: Negative DTClong (-9.05m) but large negative DTClat (-9.05m) and located rear-left.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Moving away longitudinally. Lateral velocity is slightly towards the ego vehicle, but the distance is large.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 30759**
- Distance Risk reason: Zero DTClong and DTClat. The obstacle is located directly beside the ego car in the right lane.
- Distance safety score: 2
- Time Risk reason: Moving in the same direction laterally (right) but high relative velocity.
- Time safety score: 2
- Overall Risk score: 2

- **Obstacle ID: 30762**
- Distance Risk reason: Zero DTClong and DTClat. The obstacle is located directly beside the ego car in the right lane.
- Distance safety score: 2
- Time Risk reason: Moving away laterally.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 2

- **Obstacle ID: 30763**
- Distance Risk reason: Negative DTClong (-8.34m) but large negative DTClat (-8.34m) and located rear-right.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Moving away longitudinally. Lateral velocity indicates some movement towards ego vehicle.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 30764**
- Distance Risk reason: Negative DTClong (-18.34m) but large negative DTClat (-18.34m) and located rear-right.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Moving away longitudinally. Lateral velocity indicates some movement towards ego vehicle, but distance is substantial.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 30768**
- Distance Risk reason: Negative DTClong (-19.24m) and large negative DTClat (-19.24m) and located rear-left.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Moving away longitudinally. Lateral velocity indicates some movement towards ego vehicle, but distance is substantial.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5
