Let me analyze each obstacle at the most recent timestep (0.9s) with trajectory context:

1. Obstacle 30755 (Front-right):
   - Adjusted distances: longitudinal 9.60m, lateral -8.01m
   - Moving away in both directions (velocities: 3.48m/s longitudinally, -3.74m/s laterally)
   - MDC: >5m in both dimensions (No Risk)
   - TTC: Not applicable (diverging paths)
   - Risk: 5 (Negligible)

2. Obstacle 30756 (Rear-left):
   - Adjusted distances: longitudinal -9.05m, lateral 1.80m
   - Moving away longitudinally (-2.81m/s), approaching laterally (-0.74m/s)
   - Lateral MDC: 1.80m (Medium Risk)
   - Lateral TTC: 1.80/0.74 = 2.43s (Medium Risk)
   - Risk: 3 (Medium)

3. Obstacle 30759 (Right):
   - Adjusted distances: longitudinal 0.00m, lateral -26.08m
   - Moving away rapidly in both dimensions
   - MDC: >5m (No Risk)
   - Risk: 5 (Negligible)

4. Obstacle 30762 (Right):
   - Adjusted distances: longitudinal 0.00m, lateral -3.33m
   - Moving away laterally (-0.40m/s)
   - MDC: 3.33m (Low Risk)
   - TTC: Not applicable (diverging)
   - Risk: 4 (Low)

5. Obstacle 30763 (Rear-right):
   - Adjusted distances: longitudinal -8.34m, lateral -5.96m
   - Moving away longitudinally (-1.22m/s), approaching laterally (1.55m/s)
   - Lateral MDC: 5.96m (Low Risk)
   - Lateral TTC: 5.96/1.55 = 3.85s (Low Risk)
   - Risk: 4 (Low)

6. Obstacle 30764 (Rear-right):
   - Adjusted distances: longitudinal -18.34m, lateral -11.05m
   - Moving away longitudinally (-1.09m/s), approaching laterally (1.72m/s)
   - MDC: >5m in both dimensions (No Risk)
   - TTC: Not applicable (diverging overall)
   - Risk: 5 (Negligible)

7. Obstacle 30768 (Rear-left):
   - Adjusted distances: longitudinal -19.24m, lateral 6.58m
   - Moving away longitudinally (-1.50m/s), approaching laterally (-1.38m/s)
   - Lateral MDC: 6.58m (Low Risk)
   - Lateral TTC: 6.58/1.38 = 4.77s (Low Risk)
   - Risk: 4 (Low)

JSON Summary:
```json
{
    "CollisionObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": null,
        "OverallRiskScore": null
    },
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": null,
        "OverallRiskScore": null
    },
    "HighRiskObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": null,
        "OverallRiskScore": null
    }
}
```

Analysis:
- No obstacles show collision (0), extreme (1) or high (2) risk levels
- Highest risk is Obstacle 30756 with Medium Risk (3) due to lateral approach
- All other obstacles are either Low (4) or Negligible (5) risk
- The scenario appears safe with sufficient time/distance to react to any potential risks
