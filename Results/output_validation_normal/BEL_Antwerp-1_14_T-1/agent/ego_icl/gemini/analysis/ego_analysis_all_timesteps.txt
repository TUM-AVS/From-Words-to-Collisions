Obstacle 30755: Located front-right and moving away from the ego vehicle both longitudinally and laterally.  Trajectory analysis confirms this diverging trend. TTC calculations are not relevant since the obstacle is moving away. MDC > 5.0m. Risk level: 5 (Negligible Risk).

Obstacle 30756: Located rear-left. While longitudinally moving away, it's slightly approaching laterally (0.23m to 0.83m to 1.10m to 1.28m to 1.68m to 1.60m to 1.90m to 1.80m to 1.80m).  However, the lateral distance remains > 1m and the lateral velocity is small. Longitudinal motion poses no risk. With the small lateral velocity, TTC > 5.0s.  MDC > 1.0m. Risk level: 5 (Negligible Risk).

Obstacle 30759: Located to the right and initially approaching longitudinally, but the lateral distance is large and increasing (-17.54m to -26.08m). At t=0.4, its longitudinal distance becomes zero, meaning its projected path intersects the ego's path longitudinally, however, the large and growing lateral distance makes a collision unlikely. TTC not applicable. MDC > 5m. Risk level: 5 (Negligible Risk)

Obstacle 30762: Located to the right of the ego vehicle, longitudinally aligned (0.00m). Lateral distance is consistently greater than 3.3m with varying, primarily away velocity over time.  Therefore, there is no imminent collision risk. TTC is not applicable.  MDC > 3.0m. Risk level: 4 (Low Risk)

Obstacle 30763: Located rear-right, moving away longitudinally.  Lateral distance decreasing and velocity also varying. Since longitudinally moving away, the main concern would be lateral. The lateral distance is greater than 5m and although it varies slightly over time, there is no imminent risk given the current trajectory. TTC not applicable. MDC > 5m. Risk level: 5 (Negligible Risk)

Obstacle 30764: Located rear-right and moving away both longitudinally and laterally. Trajectory analysis shows increasing distance in both dimensions.  TTC calculations not applicable.  MDC > 5.0m. Risk level: 5 (Negligible Risk)

Obstacle 30768: Located rear-left, moving further away longitudinally. Lateral distance is greater than 5m and increasing. TTC not applicable. MDC > 5m. Risk level: 5 (Negligible Risk)
