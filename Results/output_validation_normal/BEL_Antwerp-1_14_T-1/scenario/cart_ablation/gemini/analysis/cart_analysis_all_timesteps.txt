At t=0.9s, Ego is in lanelet 1292.0 at (1.8164, -176.0908) with a velocity of 4.3984 m/s.  Let's analyze the closest obstacles:

* **Obstacle 30755.0:** Located in lanelet 522.0 at (11.69, -162.1592). While the y-coordinate difference suggests longitudinal separation, the x-coordinate difference is small, indicating potential lateral proximity.  However, reviewing the trajectory shows this obstacle consistently moving further away from the ego vehicle.  Therefore, no immediate collision risk.

* **Obstacle 30756.0:** Located in lanelet 597.0 at (-1.843, -189.5876).  This obstacle is relatively close in the y-coordinate and the x difference is also not large. It's moving slower than the ego vehicle. This warrants closer attention, but based on the trajectory, it appears to be moving away from the ego vehicle path, mitigating immediate collision risk.

* **Obstacle 30762.0:** Located in lanelet 1273.0 at (6.7351, -177.3493).  This is a significant x difference, suggesting they aren't likely to collide soon.

* **Obstacle 30763.0:** Located in lanelet 499.0 at (9.1499, -189.076).  This is also not a major risk due to the differences in x and y positions. The trajectory also indicates increasing separation.

* **Other Obstacles:** The remaining obstacles are significantly far from the ego vehicle, posing no immediate threat.
