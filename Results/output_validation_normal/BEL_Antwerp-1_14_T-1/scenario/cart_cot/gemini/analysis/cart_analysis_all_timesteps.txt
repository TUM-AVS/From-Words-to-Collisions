### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:

- Obstacle ID: 30755.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is laterally separated and moving away from the ego vehicle.  The historical trajectory confirms this trend.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason:  Relative velocity and acceleration suggest no risk of collision over the analyzed timeframe.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 30756.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is laterally separated. Its y-coordinate is consistently smaller than the ego vehicle's, indicating no direct path intersection. Historical data confirms this separation.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason:  The obstacle is moving slower and decelerating, further reducing collision risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 30759.0
- Distance Risk reason: Large positive x difference indicates significant lateral separation, supported by the historical data. No intersection of paths is observed.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason:  Although moving at a similar speed, the lateral separation mitigates any collision risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 30762.0
- Distance Risk reason: The obstacle's y-coordinate is close to the ego vehicle's, but the historical trajectory shows that it remains slightly behind.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: The obstacle is traveling slower than the ego vehicle, and the trend suggests the ego vehicle is pulling ahead, reducing collision risk.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- Obstacle ID: 30763.0
- Distance Risk reason: This obstacle exhibits the highest lateral proximity to the ego vehicle, as shown by the small difference in y-coordinates. However, it maintains a safe distance.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason:  Its velocity is lower than the ego vehicleâ€™s and decelerating more, indicating a decreasing risk over time.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- Obstacle ID: 30764.0
- Distance Risk reason: Consistently larger y values indicate the obstacle is significantly behind the ego vehicle.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Lower velocity and decelerating.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 30768.0
- Distance Risk reason: Negative x values compared to the ego vehicle indicate lateral separation. History shows this has been consistent.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: The obstacle's movement doesn't pose any immediate threat.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5


### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. **Most critical obstacles:** Obstacles 30762.0 and 30763.0 exhibited the closest proximity to the ego vehicle over the observed period.

2. **Trajectory analysis:** Both obstacles maintain a safe lateral and longitudinal separation, although the separation is less for obstacle 30763. Historical data shows consistent safe separation.

3. **Relative position, velocities, and accelerations:** Obstacles 30762 and 30763 are moving slower than the ego vehicle. These obstacles maintain a safe following distance.

4. **Collision determination:** No collision has occurred or is imminent based on the provided data.

5. **Reasoning:** While some obstacles are in relatively close proximity, all maintain safe distances, and their trajectories do not intersect with the ego vehicle's path within the analyzed timeframe. The historical data supports the conclusion that the current situation is stable and safe.
