- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
The most recent timestep shows that all obstacles either have diminishing velocity, are positioned in separate lanelets, or have paths that diverge significantly from that of the ego vehicle. There are no indicators of a collision trajectory or immediate threat. Thus, this is not a collision scenario.
