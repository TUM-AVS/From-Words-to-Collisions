Obstacle 30759 is moving laterally away from the ego vehicle with -9.57 m/s and longitudinally with -5.96 m/s, but is laterally separated by a significant distance of -26.08 m.  Longitudinal real distance is 0 m, making this a high-risk obstacle if the ego vehicle moves forward. Obstacle 30762 is moving laterally away from the ego vehicle at -0.40 m/s with a lateral distance of -3.33 m. Its longitudinal velocity is 2.02 m/s and real distance is 0 m. If the ego vehicle remains stationary longitudinally, the lateral risk is low. However, combined with longitudinal movement, there's a potential collision risk if the ego were to move longitudinally forward and Obstacle 30762 fails to clear the space ahead of it. All other obstacles are moving away from the ego vehicle and pose negligible risk.
