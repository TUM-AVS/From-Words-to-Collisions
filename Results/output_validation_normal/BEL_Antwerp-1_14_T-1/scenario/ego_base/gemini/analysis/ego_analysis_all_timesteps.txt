At t=0.9s, Obstacle 30759 is closest to the ego vehicle, laterally -26.08m (right) and longitudinally aligned (0.0m).  It has a high lateral velocity (-9.57 m/s) moving away to the right and a longitudinal velocity (-5.96 m/s) towards the ego vehicle. However, given its current position and relative velocities, a collision is not imminent in the next timestep. Other obstacles are further away and do not pose an immediate threat.


**Risk Levels and Definitions:**
<Collision (Score: 0)>: Actual collision has occurred or is unavoidable within the next timestep.
<Extreme Risk (Score: 1)>: Immediate collision or very high likelihood of impact. Urgent action is required.
<High Risk (Score: 2)>: Close to collision or highly probable collision path. Needs prompt attention and quick manoeuvring.
<Medium Risk (Score: 3)>: Moderate collision risk but manageable with timely reactions and proper strategies.
<Low Risk (Score: 4)>: Minimal collision risk. The situation is controllable with sufficient time to react.
<Negligible Risk (Score: 5)>: No significant collision risk. Obstacles are either moving away or far enough not to interfere.
