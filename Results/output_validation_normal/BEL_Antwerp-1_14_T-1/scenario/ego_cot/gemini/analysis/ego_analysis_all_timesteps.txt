### Safety analysis for timestep 0.9 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

**Assumptions and Clarifications:**

* The prompt mentions "adjusted distances" (adjusted_d_long, adjusted_d_lat). However, these values are not provided in the scenario context.  Therefore, I will use the provided `real distance` (DTClong, DTClat) for the analysis.  This will likely lead to a *less precise* assessment.  For a real-world autonomous driving system, using accurate adjusted distances that account for vehicle dimensions is crucial.
* TTC calculations require relative velocity.  If an obstacle is moving away, a theoretical TTC can still be calculated, but it implies the time it would take to collide *if the relative velocity were reversed*.  I will note this in the analysis.
* I will use a simplified TTC calculation: `TTC = Distance / Relative Velocity`. More sophisticated calculations might consider acceleration as well.
* I will make inferences about MDC based on the given information.  A true MDC calculation would require more detailed trajectory information.
* No specific thresholds for distances and TTCs are provided for assigning risk scores.  I will use my expert judgment based on typical autonomous driving safety requirements.

### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID:** 30755
- **Distance Risk reason:** Located front-right and relatively far (9.6m longitudinally and laterally).
- **Distance safety score:** 5
- **Time Risk reason:** Moving away from the ego vehicle, both longitudinally and laterally.
- **Time safety score:** 5
- **Overall Risk score:** 5

- **Obstacle ID:** 30756
- **Distance Risk reason:** Located rear-left at a moderate distance (9.05m longitudinally and laterally).
- **Distance safety score:** 4
- **Time Risk reason:** Moving away longitudinally, but lateral motion is towards the ego vehicle. This requires monitoring.
- **Time safety score:** 4
- **Overall Risk score:** 4

- **Obstacle ID:** 30759
- **Distance Risk reason:** Located right, co-aligned longitudinally (0m). Lateral distance assumed to be minimal (due to context "Right").
- **Distance safety score:** 2
- **Time Risk reason:** Moving away laterally, which reduces immediate risk. However, the longitudinal relative velocity is significant (-5.96 m/s), suggesting the obstacle might have been recently crossed or is being overtaken.  
- **Time safety score:** 2
- **Overall Risk score:** 2

- **Obstacle ID:** 30762
- **Distance Risk reason:** Located right, co-aligned longitudinally (0m). Lateral distance assumed to be minimal (due to context "Right").
- **Distance safety score:** 2
- **Time Risk reason:**  Moving away laterally, thus reducing risk.  Longitudinal velocity indicates the ego vehicle is overtaking or has overtaken this obstacle.
- **Time safety score:** 3
- **Overall Risk score:** 2

- **Obstacle ID:** 30763
- **Distance Risk reason:** Located rear-right at a moderate distance (8.34m longitudinally and laterally).
- **Distance safety score:** 4
- **Time Risk reason:** Moving away longitudinally, but lateral movement is towards the ego vehicle.  Requires attention.
- **Time safety score:** 4
- **Overall Risk score:** 4

- **Obstacle ID:** 30764
- **Distance Risk reason:** Located rear-right and far (18.34m longitudinally and laterally).
- **Distance safety score:** 5
- **Time Risk reason:** Moving away longitudinally, and lateral movement towards the ego is not immediately concerning given the large distance.
- **Time safety score:** 5
- **Overall Risk score:** 5

- **Obstacle ID:** 30768
- **Distance Risk reason:** Located rear-left and far (19.24m longitudinally and laterally).
- **Distance safety score:** 5
- **Time Risk reason:** Moving away longitudinally and slightly toward ego laterally, not a concern at this distance.
- **Time safety score:** 5
- **Overall Risk score:** 5


### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
  "CollisionObstacle": null,
  "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null,
  "IsCollisionScenario": false,
  "Justification": "No obstacle poses an immediate collision risk (Overall Risk Score 0 or 1). Obstacles 30759 and 30762 have an Overall Risk Score of 2 (High Risk) due to their close lateral proximity (Right of Ego, assuming near 0m lateral adjusted distance) and require careful monitoring, though lateral movement is away from ego.  The other obstacles are at safer distances and/or moving away from the ego vehicle."
