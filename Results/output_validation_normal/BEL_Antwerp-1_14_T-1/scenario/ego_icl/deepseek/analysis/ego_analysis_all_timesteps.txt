Let me analyze the most recent timestep (0.9 seconds) for each obstacle:

1. Obstacle 30755 (Front-right):
   - Adjusted distances: longitudinal 9.60m, lateral -8.01m
   - Moving away in both directions (velocities: 3.48m/s, -3.74m/s)
   - MDC: >5m in both dimensions
   - TTC: Not applicable (diverging paths)
   - Risk: 5 (No Risk)

2. Obstacle 30756 (Rear-left):
   - Adjusted distances: longitudinal -9.05m, lateral 1.80m
   - Moving away longitudinally (-2.81m/s), approaching laterally (-0.74m/s)
   - Lateral TTC: 1.80/0.74 = 2.43s
   - MDC: 1.80m lateral
   - Risk: 3 (Medium Risk due to lateral approach)

3. Obstacle 30759 (Right):
   - Adjusted distances: longitudinal 0.00m, lateral -26.08m
   - Moving away laterally (-9.57m/s)
   - MDC: 26.08m
   - Risk: 5 (No Risk)

4. Obstacle 30762 (Right):
   - Adjusted distances: longitudinal 0.00m, lateral -3.33m
   - Moving away laterally (-0.40m/s)
   - MDC: 3.33m
   - TTC: Not applicable (diverging)
   - Risk: 4 (Low Risk due to close proximity but moving away)

5. Obstacle 30763 (Rear-right):
   - Adjusted distances: longitudinal -8.34m, lateral -5.96m
   - Approaching laterally (1.55m/s)
   - Lateral TTC: 5.96/1.55 = 3.85s
   - MDC: 5.96m
   - Risk: 4 (Low Risk)

6. Obstacle 30764 (Rear-right):
   - Adjusted distances: longitudinal -18.34m, lateral -11.05m
   - Approaching laterally (1.72m/s)
   - Lateral TTC: 11.05/1.72 = 6.42s
   - MDC: 11.05m
   - Risk: 5 (No Risk)

7. Obstacle 30768 (Rear-left):
   - Adjusted distances: longitudinal -19.24m, lateral 6.58m
   - Approaching laterally (-1.38m/s)
   - Lateral TTC: 6.58/1.38 = 4.77s
   - MDC: 6.58m
   - Risk: 4 (Low Risk)

Trajectory Analysis:
- No obstacles show collision (risk 0) or extreme risk (risk 1)
- Closest risk is Obstacle 30756 with medium risk (score 3) due to lateral approach
- Obstacle 30762 was concerning at earlier timesteps but is now moving away
- All other obstacles are at safe distances or moving away
