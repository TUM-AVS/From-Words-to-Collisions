The ego vehicle (30777.0) is decelerating while moving forward in lanelet 452.0.

Obstacle 30765.0 is stationary and presents no immediate risk. The distance between the ego vehicle and this obstacle seems to be significant enough over the observed time period.

Obstacle 30782.0 is moving in the same direction as the ego vehicle, also in lanelet 452.0.  It's also decelerating.  Critically, it's located behind the ego vehicle and its y-coordinate is decreasing at a slightly slower rate than the ego vehicle's y-coordinate.  This means the distance between the two vehicles is decreasing over time, indicating a potential collision risk if the ego vehicle continues to decelerate at a higher rate than the following vehicle.  While not immediately colliding, the closing distance suggests a high risk if the trend continues.
