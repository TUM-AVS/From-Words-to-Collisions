The ego vehicle (30777.0) is decelerating in lanelet 452.0.  Obstacle 30765.0 is stationary and poses no immediate threat. Obstacle 30782.0 is also in the same lanelet and is initially moving slightly faster than the ego vehicle, but is also decelerating.  The longitudinal distance between the ego vehicle and obstacle 30782.0 is decreasing slightly over the provided time steps. While the distance is decreasing, the rate isn't drastic enough over this short time horizon to suggest an immediate collision.  A medium risk assessment seems appropriate given the continued proximity and deceleration of both vehicles within the same lane.
