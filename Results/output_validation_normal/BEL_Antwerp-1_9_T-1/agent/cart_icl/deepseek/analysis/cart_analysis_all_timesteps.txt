### Analysis:

1. **Obstacle 30765 (Stationary Obstacle):**
   - Position: (-70.8446, -182.1798)
   - The obstacle is stationary (velocity = 0.0, acceleration = 0.0).
   - The ego vehicle is moving away from this obstacle (Y-coordinate of ego: -194.7081 vs. obstacle: -182.1798).
   - The lateral distance is significant (~12.53m in Y-axis, ~1.1154m in X-axis).
   - **No immediate risk** as the ego is moving away and the distance is increasing.

2. **Obstacle 30782 (Moving Obstacle):**
   - Position: (-68.5458, -208.144)
   - The obstacle is moving in the same direction as the ego (orientation ~1.6589, similar to ego's 1.6588).
   - Relative longitudinal position: Ego is at Y = -194.7081, obstacle at Y = -208.144 (ego is ahead by ~13.44m).
   - Relative longitudinal velocity: Ego velocity = 4.018 m/s, obstacle velocity = 5.0081 m/s (obstacle is closing in at ~0.99 m/s).
   - TTC = 13.44 / 0.99 â‰ˆ 13.58s (long time to collision).
   - Lateral distance: ~1.1834m (X-axis difference).
   - **Low risk** as the obstacle is closing in slowly and the lateral distance is sufficient.

### Risk Assessment:
- **Obstacle 30765:** Negligible Risk (5) - Stationary and far away.
- **Obstacle 30782:** Low Risk (4) - Closing in slowly with sufficient distance.
