Based on the provided scenario, we are especially looking at the dynamics at the latest time step, which is at 0.9 seconds. Let's analyze the motion of the ego vehicle and the obstacles:

### Scenario Analysis

**Ego Vehicle (30777.0):**  
- Position at 0.9s: (-69.7292, -194.7081)
- Velocity is decreasing to 4.018 m/s with a negative acceleration (-0.7034), indicating that it is decelerating.

**Obstacle 30765.0 (Stationary):**  
- Position at 0.9s: (-70.8446, -182.1798)
- This obstacle is stationary with no velocity or acceleration.
- Distance to Ego is approximately **12.44m** in the lateral (Y) direction.

**Obstacle 30782.0 (Moving in the same direction):**  
- Position at 0.9s: (-68.5458, -208.144)
- Velocity is 5.0081 m/s in a similar direction to the Ego Vehicle.
- The relative motion shows that this obstacle is slightly ahead and moving away, given the position trend.
- Distance to Ego is approximately **13.44m** in the lateral (Y) direction.

### Risk Assessment

For the current analysis, we focus primarily on the position and velocity changes to understand the risk:
- **Obstacle 30765.0:** This obstacle presents no direct threat due to being stationary and positioned at a safe lateral distance.
- **Obstacle 30782.0:** Also poses minimal risk since it is moving away and has a substantial distance laterally.

### Conclusion
There are no immediate collision threats for the Ego vehicle based on the current trajectories and relative motion.
