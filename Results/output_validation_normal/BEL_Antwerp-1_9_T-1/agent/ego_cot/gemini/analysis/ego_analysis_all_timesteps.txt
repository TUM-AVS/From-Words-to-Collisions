### Safety analysis for timestep 0.9s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

**- Obstacle ID: 30765**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 30765 is in front of the ego vehicle at a longitudinal distance of 8.07m and a lateral distance of 8.07m.  While the distance is not extremely close, the obstacle's continuous approach towards the ego vehicle represents a potential risk.  The lateral distance suggests a non-head-on trajectory, but potential lane change or unpredictable behavior from the obstacle still requires attention.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason:  The closing velocity is -4.02 m/s, indicating the gap is reducing quickly. A precise TTC calculation isn't possible without acceleration data, but roughly estimated, the TTC could be under 2 seconds which is not comfortable with 0 lateral velocity
- Time safety score: 2
- Overall Risk score: 2

**- Obstacle ID: 30782**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 30782 is behind the ego vehicle at a longitudinal distance of -8.98m and a lateral distance of -8.98m. The negative sign indicates the obstacle is behind. The current distance is safe. However, the motion description shows that the obstacle is closing in on the ego vehicle from behind. This is made more evident by the positive longitudinal relative velocity.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: The closing velocity is 0.99 m/s. Although the obstacle is behind, the closing velocity and continuous approach mean a collision might occur if ego vehicle slows down significantly.  Without more detailed knowledge of the dynamics, it's essential to monitor the obstacle's behavior.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3
