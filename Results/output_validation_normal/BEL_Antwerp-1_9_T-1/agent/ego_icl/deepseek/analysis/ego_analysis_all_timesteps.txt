### Obstacle Analysis:

#### Obstacle 30765 (Front)
- **Position**: Front of ego car (longitudinal 8.07 m, lateral 0.00 m)
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal -4.02 m/s (approaching), Lateral 0.00 m/s (stable)
- **Trajectory Analysis**: 
  - The obstacle is consistently moving toward the ego car longitudinally with decreasing distance (from 12.16 m to 8.07 m over 0.9 seconds).
  - Lateral distance remains 0.00 m, indicating exact alignment in the same lane.
  - Relative velocity is decreasing slightly but remains significant (-4.02 m/s at the last timestep).

- **TTC Calculation**:
  - Longitudinal TTC = 8.07 m / 4.02 m/s ≈ 2.01 seconds (Medium Risk)
  - Lateral TTC = N/A (no lateral movement)

- **MDC Calculation**:
  - Since the obstacle is directly ahead (lateral = 0.00 m), MDC is the longitudinal distance: 8.07 m (Low Risk).

- **Risk Assessment**:
  - TTC indicates Medium Risk (2.01 seconds).
  - MDC indicates Low Risk (8.07 m).
  - **Overall Risk**: Medium Risk (3) due to converging trajectory and TTC.

#### Obstacle 30782 (Behind)
- **Position**: Behind ego car (longitudinal -8.98 m, lateral 0.00 m)
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal 0.99 m/s (approaching), Lateral 0.00 m/s (stable)
- **Trajectory Analysis**:
  - The obstacle is slowly approaching from behind (distance changes from -9.31 m to -8.98 m over 0.9 seconds).
  - Lateral distance remains 0.00 m, indicating exact alignment in the same lane.
  - Relative velocity is low (0.99 m/s) and stable.

- **TTC Calculation**:
  - Longitudinal TTC = 8.98 m / 0.99 m/s ≈ 9.07 seconds (No Risk)
  - Lateral TTC = N/A (no lateral movement)

- **MDC Calculation**:
  - Since the obstacle is directly behind (lateral = 0.00 m), MDC is the longitudinal distance: 8.98 m (Low Risk).

- **Risk Assessment**:
  - TTC indicates No Risk (9.07 seconds).
  - MDC indicates Low Risk (8.98 m).
  - **Overall Risk**: No Risk (5) due to slow approach and large distance.

### Notes:
- No collision or extreme/high risk obstacles detected in the most recent timestep.
- Obstacle 30765 (front) poses Medium Risk due to converging trajectory but is still at a safe distance (8.07 m).
- Obstacle 30782 (behind) poses No Risk due to slow approach and large distance (8.98 m).
