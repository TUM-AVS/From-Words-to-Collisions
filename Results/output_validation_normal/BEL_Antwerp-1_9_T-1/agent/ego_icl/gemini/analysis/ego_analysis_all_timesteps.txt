Obstacle 30765 (Front):

- Trajectory: This obstacle has been consistently in front of the ego vehicle and approaching throughout all timesteps. The longitudinal distance is decreasing steadily, while lateral distance remains at 0.00m, indicating a same-lane approach.
- TTC: At t=0.9s, longitudinal distance is 8.07m, and relative velocity is -4.02 m/s. TTC = 8.07 / 4.02 ≈ 2.01 seconds.
- MDC: Given the consistent lateral alignment (0.00m) and decreasing longitudinal distance, the MDC is essentially the longitudinal distance, which is 8.07m at the last timestep.
- Risk: Based on TTC (2.01s) and MDC (8.07m), the risk level is Medium (3).

Obstacle 30782 (Behind):

- Trajectory: This obstacle has been consistently behind the ego vehicle throughout all timesteps.  The longitudinal distance is relatively stable around -9m, initially with a slightly increasing trend and later a slow decreasing trend as seen by the relative velocity that goes from 0.28 to 0.99 m/s. The lateral distance is also at 0.00 m which indicates same lane.
- TTC: At t=0.9s, longitudinal distance is -8.98m, and relative velocity is 0.99 m/s. Thus, the distance between the ego vehicle and the obstacle is closing.  TTC = 8.98 / 0.99 ≈ 9.07 seconds.
- MDC: Given the consistent lateral alignment (0.00m) and slightly decreasing longitudinal distance, the MDC is essentially the longitudinal distance, which is 8.98m at the last timestep.
- Risk: Based on TTC (9.07s) and MDC (8.98m), the risk level is Negligible (5).
