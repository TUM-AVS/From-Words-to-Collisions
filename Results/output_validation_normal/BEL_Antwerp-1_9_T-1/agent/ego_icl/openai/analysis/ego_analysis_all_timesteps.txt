### Obstacle Analysis

#### Obstacle 30765 (Front of Ego Vehicle)
- **Trajectory Analysis**: The obstacle is consistently approaching the ego vehicle from the front with decreasing longitudinal distances over the recorded timesteps.
- **Most Recent Timestep**:
  - **Adjusted Longitudinal Distance**: 8.07 m
  - **Adjusted Lateral Distance**: 0.00 m (exact alignment)
  - **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal velocity = -4.02 m/s (approaching)
- **Time-to-Collision (TTC)**:
  - \( TTC = \frac{8.07\text{ m}}{4.02\text{ m/s}} \approx 2.01\text{ seconds} \)
- **Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC)**:
  - Longitudinal distance is the primary concern due to the frontal position.
  - As MDC is largely determined by longitudinal proximity in this case, and with continued negative velocity illustrating closure, any possible collision assessment focuses here.
  - With a current MDC > 1.0 m and expected trajectory based on speed, it remains above 1.0 m.
  
**Risk Assessment**:
- **TTC Consideration**: Medium risk due to TTC < 3 seconds.
- **MDC Consideration**: Aligns with medium risk, as it does not indicate imminent collision.
- **Overall Risk Score**: Medium Risk (3)

#### Obstacle 30782 (Behind Ego Vehicle)
- **Trajectory Analysis**: This obstacle is gradually closing in from behind. However, the relative speed indicates minor closing rate.
- **Most Recent Timestep**:
  - **Adjusted Longitudinal Distance**: -8.98 m (indicating behind ego)
  - **Adjusted Lateral Distance**: 0.00 m (exact alignment)
  - **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal velocity = 0.99 m/s (approaching ego from behind)
- **Time-to-Collision (TTC)**:
  - \( TTC = \frac{8.98\text{ m}}{0.99\text{ m/s}} \approx 9.07\text{ seconds} \)
  - Exceeds meaningful collision risk threshold
- **Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC)**:
  - Longitudinal consideration primarily as it's following: MDC > 5.0 m, stable trajectory past one-second intervals confirms diversified path for longer-term no-risk.

**Risk Assessment**:
- **TTC Consideration**: Negligible risk due to TTC > 5 seconds.
- **MDC Consideration**: Aligns with TTC evaluation - sufficient distance over trajectory's closure indicates no imminent hazard.
- **Overall Risk Score**: Negligible Risk (5)

### Analysis Conclusion:
- **Obstacle 30765 (Front)** is classified as Medium Risk due to its approach trajectory and relative velocities confirming a potential collision risk if unmitigated.
- **Obstacle 30782 (Behind)** presents a Negligible Risk, with ample TTC ensuring no immediate threat of collision with ego's current state and velocity conditions.
