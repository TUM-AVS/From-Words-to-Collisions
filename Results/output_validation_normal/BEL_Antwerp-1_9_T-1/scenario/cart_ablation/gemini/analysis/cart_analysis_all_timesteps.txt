At t=0.9s, Ego is at (-69.7292, -194.7081) with a velocity of 4.018 m/s and decelerating.

Obstacle 30765 is stationary at (-70.8446, -182.1798).  The y-distance is substantial and poses no immediate threat.  Lateral distance is also significant given the low speeds involved.

Obstacle 30782 is at (-68.5458, -208.144) with a velocity of 5.0081 m/s and decelerating. While this obstacle is behind Ego, the y-distance is shrinking and requires monitoring, but not an immediate risk in this timestep.

There are no obstacles presenting a collision or extreme risk in the most recent timestep.
