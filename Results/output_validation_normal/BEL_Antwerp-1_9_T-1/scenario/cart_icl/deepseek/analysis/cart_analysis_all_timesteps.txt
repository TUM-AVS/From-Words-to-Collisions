### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep (0.9 seconds):

### Obstacle Analysis:
1. **Obstacle ID: 30765.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Static obstacle at (-70.8446, -182.1798). Ego is moving away (Y-coordinate increasing). Distance is large (~12.5 units in Y-axis).
   - **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: Static obstacle, no relative velocity.
   - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)

2. **Obstacle ID: 30782.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Moving in the same direction as ego but slower (5.0081 vs 4.018). Distance is decreasing but still large (~13.5 units in Y-axis).
   - **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: Relative velocity is small (0.99 units/s). TTC is ~13.6s (long enough for safe reaction).
   - **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low Risk)

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. Both obstacles are in the same lanelet as ego.
2. Obstacle 30765.0 is static and far behind ego (no risk).
3. Obstacle 30782.0 is ahead but decelerating faster than ego. Distance is increasing over time.
4. No collision or immediate risk detected in the current trajectory.
