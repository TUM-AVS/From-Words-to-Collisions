### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
No immediate collision detected in this timestep but obstacle 30765.0 represents a high risk due to its stationary position in the ego vehicle's path. Other obstacles are not on a direct collision course but require monitoring, especially 30755.0, 30758.0, and 30780.0 considering their relative positions and velocities. This is not currently a collision scenario, but it requires close monitoring due to some high-risk obstacles.
