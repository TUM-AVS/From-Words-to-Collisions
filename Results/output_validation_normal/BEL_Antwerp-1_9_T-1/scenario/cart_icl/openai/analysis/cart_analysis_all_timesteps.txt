  - **Distance safety score**: 5
  - **Time Risk reason**: Steady velocity away from Ego's path supports low collision likelihood.
  - **Time safety score**: 5
  - **Overall Risk score**: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 30759**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Substantial distance from Ego, present in a different lanelet.
  - **Distance safety score**: 5
  - **Time Risk reason**: Slow velocity and small positional changes imply low collision likelihood.
  - **Time safety score**: 5
  - **Overall Risk score**: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 30761**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Positioned far laterally from Ego, distinct path.
  - **Distance safety score**: 5
  - **Time Risk reason**: Stable path with no indicators of immediate intersection with Ego.
  - **Time safety score**: 5
  - **Overall Risk score**: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 30762**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Rapid deceleration; stalled in a different lanelet, high stopping probability before intersection.
  - **Distance safety score**: 3
  - **Time Risk reason**: Low velocity suggests minimal risk of collision despite deceleration anomaly.
  - **Time safety score**: 3
  - **Overall Risk score**: 3

- **Obstacle ID: 30763**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Far from Ego; consistent position maintenance in its lanelet prevents upcoming conflict.
  - **Distance safety score**: 5
  - **Time Risk reason**: Low velocity in deceleration trend supports minor collision risk.
  - **Time safety score**: 5
  - **Overall Risk score**: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 30764**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Maintains a safe lateral difference from Ego, separate path.
  - **Distance safety score**: 5
  - **Time Risk reason**: Low and stable velocity align with no collision trajectory.
  - **Time safety score**: 5
  - **Overall Risk score**: 5

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
The scenario does not indicate an immediate collision as no obstacles are in the same lanelet as the ego, and all maintain safe trajectories without intersection risks. The deceleration of 30762 is not yet causing a critical threat.
