Obstacle 30765 is in front of the ego vehicle and approaching with a decreasing relative longitudinal velocity.  The lateral distance is consistently zero, indicating a potential head-on collision if this trend continues. At the most recent timestep (0.9 seconds), the obstacle is 8.07 meters away and approaching at -4.02 m/s. While the relative longitudinal velocity is decreasing, the short distance and continued approach represent a high risk.

Obstacle 30782 is behind the ego vehicle and approaching with a small, fluctuating relative longitudinal velocity. The lateral distance is near zero. At the most recent timestep (0.9 seconds), the obstacle is -8.98 meters away (behind the ego vehicle) and approaching at 0.99 m/s.  While the closing velocity is relatively low, the consistent approach and near-zero lateral distance could pose a risk if the ego vehicle were to brake suddenly or change lanes.

Although no immediate collision is imminent, the persistent approach of obstacle 30765 at a relatively short distance combined with zero lateral separation classifies this as a high-risk scenario demanding immediate attention. Obstacle 30782 poses a medium risk.

    "Reasoning": "Obstacle 30765 poses a high risk due to its proximity (8.07m) and closing velocity (-4.02 m/s) while maintaining zero lateral distance.  Although the relative longitudinal velocity is decreasing, the short distance and the continued approach require immediate attention. Obstacle 30782 represents a medium risk due to the relatively low closing velocity and position behind the ego vehicle."
