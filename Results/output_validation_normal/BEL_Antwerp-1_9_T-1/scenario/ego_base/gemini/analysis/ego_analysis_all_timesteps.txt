At t=0.9s, Obstacle 30765 is in front of the ego vehicle, approaching longitudinally at -4.02 m/s with a real distance of 8.07 meters.  While the closing rate is significant, it doesn't suggest an immediate collision within the next timestep (0.1 seconds). Obstacle 30782 is behind the ego, approaching at 0.99 m/s with a distance of -8.98 meters. This also does not indicate an immediate collision. Given the current data, no immediate collision is predicted within the next timestep. However, Obstacle 30765 poses a high risk due to its closing velocity and proximity.
