### Safety analysis for timestep 0.9 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

It's important to note that the provided scenario information lacks crucial details for accurate TTC and MDC calculations.  Specifically, we are missing vehicle dimensions to calculate adjusted longitudinal and lateral distances (adjusted_d_long and adjusted_d_lat).  Additionally, constant velocity is assumed due to missing consistent acceleration data.  This simplified approach may not reflect real-world scenarios.

### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 30765**
- Distance Risk reason:  Obstacle 30765 is in front of the ego vehicle with a longitudinal distance of 8.07m and a lateral distance of 8.07m at the last timestep (0.9s). It has been consistently moving closer longitudinally with a negative relative velocity (-4.02 m/s).  Without adjusted distances, we can infer a potential risk if the lateral distance signifies the obstacle moving directly towards the ego vehicle or if the ego vehicle is making a turn toward the obstacle's path. Exact lateral alignment is unknown. 
- Distance safety score: 3 (Medium Risk)
- Time Risk reason: Assuming constant velocity, approximate TTClong is 8.07m / 4.02 m/s ≈ 2 seconds. With no lateral velocity, there is no lateral TTC (infinite). However, lateral distance should not be ignored. 
- Time safety score: 3 (Medium Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 3 (Medium Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 30782**
- Distance Risk reason:  Obstacle 30782 is behind the ego vehicle at a longitudinal distance of -8.98m and lateral distance of -8.98m at the last timestep (0.9s). The negative longitudinal distance indicates its position behind the ego vehicle. Although it is closing in longitudinally (relative velocity 0.99 m/s), the lateral distance and lack of precise trajectory information make assessing the risk challenging.
- Distance safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
- Time Risk reason: Assuming constant velocity, approximate TTClong is -8.98m / 0.99 m/s ≈ -9 seconds. The negative value suggests that under constant velocity, the obstacle would take 9 seconds to reach the ego vehicle's current position (if the ego vehicle remained stationary). Similar to obstacle 30765, the lateral motion cannot be accurately assessed due to unknown exact lateral alignment.
- Time safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 4 (Low Risk)

{
    "CollisionObstacle": null,
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null,
    "IsCollisionScenario": false,
    "Justification": "Although Obstacle 30765 poses a medium risk, the current data does not indicate an immediate or extremely probable collision within the next few seconds. More precise trajectory information, adjusted distances, and vehicle dimensions are needed to make a definitive collision assessment."
