### Obstacle-by-Obstacle Analysis

#### Obstacle 30765 (Front of ego car)
- **Latest Timestep (0.9s):**
  - **Adjusted Distance:** Longitudinal = 8.07 m, Lateral = 0.00 m
  - **Relative Velocity:** Longitudinal = -4.02 m/s (approaching), Lateral = 0.00 m/s (no lateral movement)
  - **Motion Description:** Obstacle is driving toward the ego car longitudinally with exact lateral alignment.
  - **Trajectory Analysis:**
    - Longitudinal distance decreases from 12.16 m (0.1s) to 8.07 m (0.9s), showing consistent closing behavior.
    - Lateral distance remains 0.00 m (exact alignment), but no lateral movement is observed.
  - **TTC Calculation:**
    - TTC (longitudinal) = 8.07 m / 4.02 m/s ≈ 2.01 seconds
    - TTC (lateral) = N/A (no lateral movement)
    - **TTC Risk:** Medium Risk (3) (1.0 < TTC ≤ 3.0 seconds)
  - **MDC Calculation:**
    - MDC is primarily the lateral distance (0.00 m), but since there is no lateral movement, the risk is driven by longitudinal closing.
    - **MDC Risk:** No Risk (5) (MDC > 5.0 meters longitudinally, but exact lateral alignment is not risky without closing).
  - **Overall Risk:** Medium Risk (3) (prioritize TTC over MDC due to closing trajectory).

#### Obstacle 30782 (Behind ego car)
- **Latest Timestep (0.9s):**
  - **Adjusted Distance:** Longitudinal = -8.98 m, Lateral = 0.00 m
  - **Relative Velocity:** Longitudinal = 0.99 m/s (approaching), Lateral = 0.00 m/s (no lateral movement)
  - **Motion Description:** Obstacle is driving toward the ego car from behind with exact lateral alignment.
  - **Trajectory Analysis:**
    - Longitudinal distance changes from -9.31 m (0.1s) to -8.98 m (0.9s), showing slow closing behavior.
    - Lateral distance remains 0.00 m (exact alignment), but no lateral movement is observed.
  - **TTC Calculation:**
    - TTC (longitudinal) = 8.98 m / 0.99 m/s ≈ 9.07 seconds
    - TTC (lateral) = N/A (no lateral movement)
    - **TTC Risk:** No Risk (5) (TTC > 5.0 seconds)
  - **MDC Calculation:**
    - MDC is primarily the lateral distance (0.00 m), but since there is no lateral movement, the risk is driven by longitudinal closing.
    - **MDC Risk:** No Risk (5) (MDC > 5.0 meters longitudinally, and exact lateral alignment is not risky without closing).
  - **Overall Risk:** No Risk (5).

### Collision Scenario Determination
- Neither obstacle has a risk score of 0 (collision) or 1 (extreme risk).
- Obstacle 30765 has a Medium Risk (3) due to closing longitudinal distance, but TTC is still above 1.0 seconds.
- Obstacle 30782 poses No Risk (5) due to slow closing speed and large distance.
- **This is not a collision scenario.**
