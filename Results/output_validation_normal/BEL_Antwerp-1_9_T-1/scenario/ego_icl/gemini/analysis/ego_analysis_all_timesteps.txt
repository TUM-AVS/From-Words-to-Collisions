Obstacle 30765 (Front):

* Trajectory Analysis: This obstacle has been consistently in front of the ego vehicle and moving closer over the observed time steps.  The longitudinal distance has decreased from 12.16m to 8.07m over 0.9 seconds.  Lateral distance remains at 0.00m, indicating continued alignment.

* TTC Calculation (Longitudinal):  Distance (8.07m) / |Relative Velocity| (4.02 m/s) = 2.01 seconds

* MDC Calculation: Since the obstacle is directly in front and aligned laterally (0.00m lateral distance), MDC is primarily determined by the longitudinal distance, which is 8.07m.

* Risk Assessment:
    * Longitudinal: Medium Risk (3) based on TTC of 2.01s.
    * Lateral: No Risk (5) as the lateral distance is zero, but the motion description suggests a stable lateral alignment rather than an intersection from the side.

* Overall Risk: Medium Risk (3) -  Driven by the longitudinal TTC.

Obstacle 30782 (Behind):

* Trajectory Analysis: This obstacle is behind the ego vehicle and getting closer across the timesteps. The longitudinal distance has decreased from -9.31m to -8.98m (note: negative indicating behind the ego vehicle) over the 0.9 seconds.  Lateral distance remains at 0.00m indicating persistent longitudinal alignment.

* TTC Calculation (Longitudinal): Distance (8.98m) / |Relative Velocity| (0.99 m/s) = 9.07 seconds.

* MDC Calculation: Since the obstacle is directly behind and aligned laterally (0.00m lateral distance), MDC is primarily determined by the longitudinal distance, which is 8.98m.

* Risk Assessment:
    * Longitudinal: No Risk (5) based on TTC.
    * Lateral: No Risk (5) as the lateral distance is zero, and the motion description indicates longitudinal movement.

* Overall Risk: No Risk (5).

Collision Scenario Determination:

No obstacle has a risk score of 0 (collision) or 1 (extreme risk). Therefore, this is NOT a collision scenario.
