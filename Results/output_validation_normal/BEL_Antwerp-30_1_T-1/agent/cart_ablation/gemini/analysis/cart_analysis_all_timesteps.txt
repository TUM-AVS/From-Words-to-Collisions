Obstacle 30638 is getting closer to the ego vehicle over time.  While it's not on a direct collision course in the very near future based on the provided data, its continuous approach and the ego vehicle's deceleration warrants close monitoring. The lane information suggests they might be on intersecting trajectories (lanelets 107 vs 341).

Obstacle 30640 is initially somewhat close to the ego vehicle but appears to be moving away slightly and its lane changes from 339 to 1149 suggesting it's not a direct threat in the short term.

Given the current trajectories and velocities, a collision is not imminent within the next second, but Obstacle 30638 poses a higher risk due to its continuous approach toward the ego vehicle. Therefore, I'd classify it as a High Risk (2), while 30640 presents as a Medium to Low Risk (3-4) in the short term.
