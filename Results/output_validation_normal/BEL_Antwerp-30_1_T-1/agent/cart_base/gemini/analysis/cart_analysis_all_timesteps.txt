Obstacle 30638 is located in a different lanelet (107) than the ego vehicle (341) and appears to be moving away from the ego vehicle.  Obstacle 30640 starts in lanelet 339 and transitions to lanelet 1149.  While the lanelets of the ego vehicle and obstacle 30640 are adjacent at the beginning of the scenario, the y-coordinates suggest they may not represent physically adjacent lanes (ego's y decreases while 30640's y increases). Also, the distance between them appears to be increasing over time.  Neither obstacle shows an immediate risk of collision with the ego vehicle.
