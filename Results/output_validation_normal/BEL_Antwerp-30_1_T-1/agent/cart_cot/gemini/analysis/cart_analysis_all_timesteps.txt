At t=0.9s, the ego vehicle is at (-426.8185, -265.7083) with a velocity of 6.4674 and heading -1.9971 rad. Let's analyze the risk posed by each obstacle:

**Obstacle 30638.0:** Position (-415.87, -278.7037), velocity 8.342, heading -0.4592 rad.  This obstacle is primarily behind and slightly to the left of the ego vehicle. Although the y-coordinates suggest a potential lateral risk, the difference in x-coordinates (-415.87 vs. -426.82) and the trajectories from previous time steps indicate that this obstacle is moving *away* from the ego vehicle, reducing the risk.

**Obstacle 30640.0:** Position (-427.8986, -277.1776), velocity 7.9835, heading 1.1477 rad. This obstacle is very close to the ego vehicle, slightly ahead and significantly to the left. The y-coordinate difference is substantial (-277.18 vs -265.71), suggesting a high lateral risk.  The x-coordinates are also extremely close indicating a high longitudinal risk if the ego vehicle maintains its current trajectory. The trajectory history also points toward continued proximity or even a potential collision.

**Risk Assessment:**

Obstacle 30638.0: Negligible Risk (Overall Risk Score: 5)
Obstacle 30640.0: High Risk (Overall Risk Score: 2). Due to its immediate proximity and converging trajectory. The lateral and longitudinal distances are concerning enough to classify this obstacle as an imminent hazard.
