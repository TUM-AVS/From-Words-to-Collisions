At t=0.9s, the ego vehicle is at (-426.8185, -265.7083) with a velocity of 6.4674 m/s and acceleration of -1.4201 m/s². Let's analyze the risk posed by each obstacle:

**Obstacle 30638:** Located at (-415.87, -278.7037) with velocity 8.342 m/s and acceleration 2.344 m/s².  This obstacle is behind and to the left of the ego vehicle. While it is moving faster than the ego vehicle, the lateral separation suggests low risk of collision in the immediate future. Further monitoring is needed to ensure safety, however current data suggests low risk for near future.

**Obstacle 30640:** Located at (-427.8986, -277.1776) with velocity 7.9835 m/s and acceleration 2.462 m/s². This obstacle is slightly ahead and significantly to the left of the ego vehicle. The positions, orientations, and velocities suggest that both are moving in a generally parallel direction however the obstacle is in a different lanelet. This situation presents a Low Risk due to larger lateral separation.
