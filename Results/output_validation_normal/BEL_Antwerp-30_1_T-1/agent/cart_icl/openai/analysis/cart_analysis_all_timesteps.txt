### Detailed Evaluation:

**Ego Vehicle at 0.9 Seconds:**
- Position: (-426.8185, -265.7083)
- Orientation: -1.9971 radians
- Velocity: 6.4674 m/s
- Acceleration: -1.4201 m/s²
- Lanelet: 341.0

**Obstacle 30638 at 0.9 Seconds:**
- Position: (-415.87, -278.7037)
- Orientation: -0.4592 radians
- Velocity: 8.342 m/s
- Acceleration: 2.344 m/s²
- Lanelet: 107.0

Relative Position to Ego:
- Longitudinal position: Ahead, approximately at -10.95m in Y-axis
- Lateral position approximately 11 meters towards positive X-axis
- Relative velocity: Increasing distance due to different lanelet and position

Risk Analysis:
- No clear collision path within the immediate future.
- Separate lanelet; trajectory doesn't indicate intersection.
- **Risk Score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)

**Obstacle 30640 at 0.9 Seconds:**
- Position: (-427.8986, -277.1776)
- Orientation: 1.1477 radians
- Velocity: 7.9835 m/s
- Acceleration: 2.462 m/s²
- Lanelet: 1149.0

Relative Position to Ego:
- Lateral distance: Approximately 11 meters towards negative Y-axis.
- Similar longitudinal distance, minor changes do not imply crossing paths immediately.

Risk Analysis:
- Different lanelet, significant lateral separation, unlikely immediate collision trajectory.
- **Risk Score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
