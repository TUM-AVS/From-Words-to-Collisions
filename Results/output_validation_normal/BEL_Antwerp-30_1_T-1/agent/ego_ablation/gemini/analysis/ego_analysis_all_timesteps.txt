At t=0.9s, Obstacle 30638 is at a longitudinal distance of 2.80m and a lateral distance of 13.73m, moving longitudinally at -6.19 m/s and laterally at 8.34 m/s.  While the longitudinal distance is small, the high lateral velocity suggests it will likely continue to move further away from the ego vehicle's path.  Obstacle 30640, however, is at a longitudinal distance of 6.38m and lateral distance of 2.15m, moving longitudinally at -14.45 m/s and laterally at -0.03 m/s. The longitudinal velocity is high, and the lateral distance is very small.

Obstacle 30640 poses an extreme risk of collision.
