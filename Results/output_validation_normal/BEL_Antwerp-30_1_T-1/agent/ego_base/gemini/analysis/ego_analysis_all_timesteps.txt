Obstacle 30638 is very close to the ego vehicle longitudinally (2.80m) and moving closer at -6.19 m/s. Although it's moving away laterally, the longitudinal proximity represents a very high risk.

Obstacle 30640 is also closing longitudinally (6.38m away at -14.45 m/s) and slightly laterally as well. While further away than 30638, its higher closing speed makes it a significant risk as well. Both obstacles warrant immediate attention.
