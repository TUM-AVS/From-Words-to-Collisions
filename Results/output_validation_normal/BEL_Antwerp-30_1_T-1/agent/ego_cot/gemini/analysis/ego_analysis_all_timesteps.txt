### Safety analysis for timestep 0.9s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:
**- Obstacle ID: 30638**
- Distance Risk reason: At 0.9s, Obstacle 30638 is located 2.80m longitudinally and 2.80m laterally from the ego vehicle in the front-left direction. The continuous decrease in longitudinal distance suggests a high risk of collision.  The lateral movement away from the ego vehicle slightly mitigates the risk, but the overall situation remains critical.
- Distance safety score: 1
- Time Risk reason: The decreasing longitudinal distance and the relative velocity indicate a very short time to collision, increasing the risk. The lateral relative velocity and acceleration suggest the obstacle might avoid a direct collision, but the longitudinal component is concerning.
- Time safety score: 1
- Overall Risk score: 1

**- Obstacle ID: 30640**
- Distance Risk reason: At 0.9s, Obstacle 30640 is 6.38m longitudinally and 6.38m laterally away from the ego vehicle, positioned in the front-left. Though the distances seem safe for the moment, the consistent longitudinal closing speed shown across the timestamps suggests a growing risk. The lateral movement towards the ego vehicle also warrants attention.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: While the current distances don't pose an immediate danger, the persistent closing velocity, particularly in the longitudinal direction, indicates a possible future collision if no evasive action is taken.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3
