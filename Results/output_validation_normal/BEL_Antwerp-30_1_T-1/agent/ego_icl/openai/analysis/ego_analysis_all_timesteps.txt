### Obstacle Analysis

**Obstacle 30638:**

**Trajectory Analysis:**
- Over the observed timeframe, Obstacle 30638 continuously approaches the ego vehicle longitudinally with a relative velocity ranging from -7.69 m/s to -6.19 m/s, and a slight reduction in longitudinal relative velocity suggesting slight deceleration, but still overall approaching.
- Laterally, the obstacle moves away from the ego vehicle (increasing lateral distance), indicating no side-on collision risk.

**Current State (0.9s):**
- **Adjusted Longitudinal Distance:** 2.80 m
- **Adjusted Lateral Distance:** 13.73 m
- **Relative Velocity Longitudinal:** -6.19 m/s (approaching)
- **Relative Velocity Lateral:** 8.34 m/s (moving away)

**Calculations:**
- **TTC Longitudinal:** 2.80 m / 6.19 m/s ≈ 0.45 seconds
- **TTC Lateral:** Not applicable as the obstacle is moving away.

Given the scenario, the primary concern is longitudinal collision risk.

**Risk Assessment:**
- **MDC:** 2.80 m (primarily longitudinal)
- **TTC Longitudinal:** 0.45 s

**Risk Score:**
- **Longitudinal TTC Conditions:** TTC < 0.5 s indicates an extreme collision risk.

**Obstacle 30640:**

**Trajectory Analysis:**
- The obstacle consistently approaches the ego vehicle, both longitudinally and slightly laterally.
- Longitudinal velocities range from -14.19 m/s to -14.45 m/s, showing sustained speed and approach.
- Lateral velocities indicate slight approaching from the left, but much slower than longitudinal approach.

**Current State (0.9s):**
- **Adjusted Longitudinal Distance:** 6.38 m
- **Adjusted Lateral Distance:** 2.15 m
- **Relative Velocity Longitudinal:** -14.45 m/s (approaching)
- **Relative Velocity Lateral:** -0.03 m/s (approaching slightly)

**Calculations:**
- **TTC Longitudinal:** 6.38 m / 14.45 m/s ≈ 0.44 seconds
- **TTC Lateral:** 2.15 m / 0.03 m/s = 71.67 s (negligible)

**Risk Assessment:**
- **MDC:** 6.38 m (primarily longitudinal)
- **TTC Longitudinal:** 0.44 s

**Risk Score:**
- **Longitudinal TTC Conditions:** TTC < 0.5 s indicates an extreme collision risk.

**Analysis Conclusion:**
- Both obstacles are presenting extreme risk conditions due to rapidly closing longitudinal distances with TTC < 0.5 seconds. Immediate action should be taken to mitigate collision risk, especially for Obstacle 30638, which is the more immediate threat due to extremely short TTC.
