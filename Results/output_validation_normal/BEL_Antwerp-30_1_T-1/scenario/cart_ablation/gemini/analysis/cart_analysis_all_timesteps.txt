At t=0.9s, Ego is at (-426.8185, -265.7083) in lanelet 341.0.

Obstacle 30638.0 is at (-415.87, -278.7037) in lanelet 107.0.  While the y-coordinates are somewhat close, the x-coordinates are significantly different, suggesting these lanelets are likely parallel and separated, indicating low risk. Also, the trajectories show diverging paths.

Obstacle 30640.0 is at (-427.8986, -277.1776) in lanelet 1149.0. The x-coordinates are very close, and the y-coordinates are converging.  The trajectories clearly indicate a high probability of collision in the next few timesteps. This obstacle poses an extreme risk.
