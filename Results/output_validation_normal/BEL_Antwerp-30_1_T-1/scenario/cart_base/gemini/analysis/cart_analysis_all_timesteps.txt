At t=0.9s, Ego is at (-426.8185, -265.7083) in lanelet 341.0.

Obstacle 30638.0 is at (-415.87, -278.7037) in lanelet 107.0.  While the y-coordinates are somewhat close, the x-coordinates differ significantly, indicating a safe lateral distance. Additionally, past trajectories suggest diverging paths. This obstacle poses no immediate collision risk.

Obstacle 30640.0 is at (-427.8986, -277.1776) in lanelet 1149.0.  This obstacle is close to the ego vehicle in terms of x-coordinate, and the y-coordinate difference is decreasing over time.  This suggests a potential collision risk in the near future. Although not an immediate collision at t=0.9s, the rapidly decreasing distance and relatively close proximity warrant an "Extreme Risk" classification.
