### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep:

### Obstacle Analysis:
#### Obstacle ID: 30638.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is moving in a different lanelet (107.0) than the ego vehicle (341.0). Over the timesteps, the obstacle has been moving away from the ego vehicle in the Y-direction (from -276.0992 to -278.7037) while the ego vehicle is moving towards negative Y. The lateral distance is increasing.
- **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
- **Time Risk reason**: The obstacle's velocity (8.342) is higher than the ego's (6.4674), and it is accelerating away (2.344). The relative velocity suggests the obstacle is moving away.
- **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
- **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low Risk)

#### Obstacle ID: 30640.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is in lanelet 1149.0, which is different from the ego's lanelet (341.0). The obstacle is moving away in the Y-direction (from -282.3995 to -277.1776) while the ego is moving towards negative Y. The lateral distance is increasing.
- **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
- **Time Risk reason**: The obstacle's velocity (7.9835) is higher than the ego's (6.4674), and it is accelerating away (2.462). The relative velocity suggests the obstacle is moving away.
- **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
- **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low Risk)

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. **Lanelet Analysis**: Ego is in lanelet 341.0, while obstacles are in lanelets 107.0 and 1149.0. No overlap in lanelets suggests no immediate collision risk.
2. **Trajectory Analysis**: Both obstacles are moving away from the ego vehicle in the Y-direction, and the lateral distance is increasing over time.
3. **Velocity/Acceleration**: Both obstacles have higher velocities and are accelerating away from the ego vehicle.
4. **Conclusion**: No collision risk is present, and the overall risk is low for both obstacles.
