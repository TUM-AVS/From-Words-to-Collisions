### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 30636.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is in a different lanelet and moving away from the ego vehicle.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason:  Relative velocity and trajectories indicate no imminent risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 30638.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is in a different lanelet and relatively close but moving away from the ego.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Relative velocities suggest decreasing risk over time.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- Obstacle ID: 30640.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is in a different lanelet and moving away from the ego vehicle.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Relative velocities and trajectories indicate no imminent risk.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4


### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. At the last timestep (0.9s), no obstacle shares the ego vehicle's lanelet (341.0).
2. Obstacle 30638.0 is in lanelet 107.0, closest to the ego, but the y-coordinate difference suggests it's to the ego vehicle's side, reducing collision risk.
3. Obstacles 30636.0 and 30640.0 are in different lanelets and further away, posing even less risk.
4.  No obstacle has a risk score of 0 or 1.

Therefore, this is not a collision scenario.
