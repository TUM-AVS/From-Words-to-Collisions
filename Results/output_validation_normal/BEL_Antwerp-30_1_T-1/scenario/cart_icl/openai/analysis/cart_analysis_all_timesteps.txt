### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep:
Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 30636.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: This obstacle remains consistently in a different lanelet (342.0), moving diagonally away from the ego. Itâ€™s far from the ego's path.
  - **Distance safety score**: 5
  - **Time Risk reason**: Maintaining high speed with minor fluctuation in velocity and acceleration; not approaching the ego vehicle's path.
  - **Time safety score**: 5
  - **Overall Risk score**: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 30638.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Moving roughly parallel and was in proximity to the ego vehicle initially but diverging away, ensuring no immediate collision threat.
  - **Distance safety score**: 4
  - **Time Risk reason**: Positive increase in velocity and acceleration showing divergence rather than approaching, reducing the threat.
  - **Time safety score**: 4
  - **Overall Risk score**: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 30640.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Positioned in a different lane at a considerable distance, and diverging further based on relative movements.
  - **Distance safety score**: 4
  - **Time Risk reason**: Consistent acceleration with no indications of crossing paths with the ego vehicle in the lane.
  - **Time safety score**: 4
  - **Overall Risk score**: 4

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
- **Step-by-step reasoning**:
  1. **Obstacle Proximity Analysis**: At every time step, obstacles maintain a safe distance, particularly notable with their positions reflecting divergent paths.
  2. **Orientation and Velocity Trends**: None of the obstacles exhibit behavior consistent with crossing into the ego vehicle's trajectory based on their orientation and velocity data.
  3. **Locational Stability**: Each obstacle occupies a different lanelet without shifting towards lanelet 341.0 where the ego is positioned, indicating no collision likelihood.
  
Summarily, all metrics indicate that there's no immediate collision or extreme risk present.
