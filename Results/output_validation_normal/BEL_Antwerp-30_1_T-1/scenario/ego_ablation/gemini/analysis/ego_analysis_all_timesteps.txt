Obstacle 30638 is approaching the ego vehicle longitudinally, with a decreasing longitudinal distance of 2.80 meters in the last timestep. However, it's simultaneously moving laterally away from the ego vehicle, increasing the lateral distance to 13.73 meters.  While the longitudinal distance is a concern, the lateral movement suggests a mitigating factor. This obstacle presents a potential risk but not an immediate collision threat in the very next timestep.

Obstacle 30640 is also approaching longitudinally, with a decreasing distance of 6.38 meters.  The lateral distance is also small at 2.15 meters and slightly decreasing, making this obstacle a significant concern. This obstacle poses the most immediate risk.

    "Reasoning": "Obstacle 30640 poses an extreme risk with a rapidly closing longitudinal distance of 6.38m and a small lateral distance of 2.15m. While no collision is imminent in the next timestep, the high closing speed and proximity suggest a very high probability of collision in the near future if no evasive action is taken. Obstacle 30638 is also approaching but its lateral movement away reduces the immediate risk."
