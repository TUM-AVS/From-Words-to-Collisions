Obstacle 30638 is very close to the ego vehicle longitudinally (2.80m) and moving towards it, though it is moving away laterally.  Obstacle 30640 is also quite close longitudinally (6.38m) and moving towards the ego vehicle, and slightly towards it laterally as well. While 30638's lateral movement may avert a collision, 30640 poses a more immediate risk due to its closing longitudinal distance and slight lateral movement towards the ego vehicle.


Risk Levels and Definitions:
<Collision (Score: 0)>: Actual collision has occurred or is unavoidable within the next timestep.
<Extreme Risk (Score: 1)>: Immediate collision or very high likelihood of impact. Urgent action is required.
<High Risk (Score: 2)>: Close to collision or highly probable collision path. Needs prompt attention and quick manoeuvring.
<Medium Risk (Score: 3)>: Moderate collision risk but manageable with timely reactions and proper strategies.
<Low Risk (Score: 4)>: Minimal collision risk. The situation is controllable with sufficient time to react.
<Negligible Risk (Score: 5)>: No significant collision risk. Obstacles are either moving away or far enough not to interfere.

While not a guaranteed collision in the next timestep, the risk is very high and requires immediate action. Obstacle 30638 is also close, but its lateral movement slightly reduces the immediate risk compared to 30640."
