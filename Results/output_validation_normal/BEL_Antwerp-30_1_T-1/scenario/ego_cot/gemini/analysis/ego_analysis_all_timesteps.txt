### Safety analysis for timestep 0.9 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 30638**
- Distance Risk reason: At 0.9 seconds, Obstacle 30638 is located 2.80m longitudinally and 2.80m laterally from the ego vehicle in the front-left direction.  The decreasing longitudinal distance and relatively small lateral distance indicate a high risk of collision.
- Distance safety score: 1 (Extreme Risk)
- Time Risk reason:  While the lateral movement suggests the obstacle might avoid a collision, the consistently decreasing longitudinal distance throughout the provided timestamps indicates a very high probability of an imminent longitudinal collision.
- Time safety score: 1 (Extreme Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 1 (Extreme Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 30640**
- Distance Risk reason: At 0.9 seconds, Obstacle 30640 is 6.38m longitudinally and 6.38m laterally from the ego vehicle in the front-left direction. Though the distances are larger than those of Obstacle 30638, they are still close enough to warrant concern. The obstacle's lateral movement towards the ego vehicle increases the risk.
- Distance safety score: 2 (High Risk)
- Time Risk reason: The continuous reduction in longitudinal distance over the timestamps suggests a likely collision if the current trajectories persist. The relatively small lateral distance and its movement towards the ego vehicle exacerbate this risk.
- Time safety score: 2 (High Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 2 (High Risk)



### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
  "CollisionObstacle": null,
  "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {
    "ObstacleID": "30638",
    "OverallRiskScore": "1"
  },
  "IsCollisionScenario": false, 
  "Justification": "Obstacle 30638 poses an extreme risk of collision due to its close proximity (2.80m longitudinally and laterally) and decreasing longitudinal distance, despite its lateral movement away from the ego vehicle. While no immediate collision is detected, the scenario is extremely dangerous, hence classified as extreme risk for Obstacle 30638. Obstacle 30640 is considered high risk, but not an immediate collision risk at this point."
