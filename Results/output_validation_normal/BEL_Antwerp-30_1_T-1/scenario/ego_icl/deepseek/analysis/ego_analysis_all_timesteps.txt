### Obstacle-by-Obstacle Analysis (Most Recent Timestep: 0.9s)

#### **Obstacle 30638 (Front-left)**
- **Adjusted Distances**: Longitudinal 2.80 m, Lateral 13.73 m  
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal -6.19 m/s (approaching), Lateral 8.34 m/s (moving away left)  
- **Motion**:  
  - Longitudinally: Approaching ego at **6.19 m/s** (closing distance).  
  - Laterally: Moving away at **8.34 m/s** (increasing lateral separation).  

##### **Risk Assessment**:
1. **Time-to-Collision (TTC)**:  
   - Longitudinal TTC = 2.80 m / 6.19 m/s = **0.45 seconds** (Extreme Risk, TTC ≤ 0.5s).  
   - Lateral TTC: Not applicable (moving away).  

2. **Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC)**:  
   - Lateral distance is increasing (13.73 m), so MDC is dominated by longitudinal proximity.  
   - **MDC = 2.80 m** (Medium Risk, 1.0 < MDC ≤ 3.0 m).  

3. **Overall Risk**:  
   - **TTC (0.45s)** indicates Extreme Risk (1).  
   - **MDC (2.80m)** indicates Medium Risk (3).  
   - **Priority**: Extreme Risk (1) due to imminent collision threat from TTC.

#### **Obstacle 30640 (Front-left)**
- **Adjusted Distances**: Longitudinal 6.38 m, Lateral 2.15 m  
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal -14.45 m/s (approaching), Lateral -0.03 m/s (negligible lateral motion).  
- **Motion**:  
  - Longitudinally: Rapidly approaching at **14.45 m/s** (high closing speed).  
  - Laterally: Nearly static (minimal lateral movement toward ego).  

##### **Risk Assessment**:
1. **Time-to-Collision (TTC)**:  
   - Longitudinal TTC = 6.38 m / 14.45 m/s = **0.44 seconds** (Extreme Risk, TTC ≤ 0.5s).  
   - Lateral TTC: Not applicable (no significant lateral motion).  

2. **Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC)**:  
   - Lateral distance is stable (2.15 m), so MDC is **2.15 m** (Medium Risk, 1.0 < MDC ≤ 3.0 m).  

3. **Overall Risk**:  
   - **TTC (0.44s)** indicates Extreme Risk (1).  
   - **MDC (2.15m)** indicates Medium Risk (3).  
   - **Priority**: Extreme Risk (1) due to imminent collision threat from TTC.

### **Trajectory Analysis**
- **Obstacle 30638**:  
  - Longitudinal distance decreases from 8.67 m (0.1s) to 2.80 m (0.9s) at ~6.19 m/s.  
  - Lateral distance increases (7.53 m to 13.73 m), confirming divergence.  
  - **Collision unlikely laterally but imminent longitudinally**.  

- **Obstacle 30640**:  
  - Longitudinal distance drops from 18.14 m (0.1s) to 6.38 m (0.9s) at ~14.45 m/s.  
  - Lateral motion is negligible (~2.1 m to 2.15 m).  
  - **High-speed frontal collision imminent**.

### **Collision Scenario Determination**
- **Obstacle 30638**: Extreme Risk (TTC = 0.45s).  
- **Obstacle 30640**: Extreme Risk (TTC = 0.44s).  
- **Both obstacles** meet Extreme Risk criteria (TTC ≤ 0.5s).
