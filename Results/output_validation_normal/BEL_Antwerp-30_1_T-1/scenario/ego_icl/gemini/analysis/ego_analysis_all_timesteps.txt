Obstacle 30638 Analysis:

* Trajectory: This obstacle is approaching the ego vehicle longitudinally while moving away laterally.  Across the timesteps, the longitudinal distance decreases from 8.67m to 2.80m, while the lateral distance increases from 7.53m to 13.73m. This indicates a diagonal trajectory where the obstacle is moving towards the ego car's path but also away to the left.

* TTC Calculation (Longitudinal): At t=0.9s, the longitudinal distance is 2.80m and the relative longitudinal velocity is -6.19 m/s. TTC = 2.80m / 6.19m/s ≈ 0.45s

* TTC Calculation (Lateral):  While the lateral distance is decreasing, the obstacle is moving away from the ego vehicle laterally. Hence, lateral TTC is not relevant for collision risk in this case.

* MDC Calculation: Given the obstacle's diagonal approach and its leftward lateral movement, the MDC is the longitudinal distance of 2.80m at the last timestep.

* Risk Assessment:
    * Longitudinal TTC of 0.45s indicates an Extreme Risk (1).
    * MDC of 2.80m suggests a Medium Risk (3).
    * Prioritizing the higher risk, the overall risk is Extreme (1).


Obstacle 30640 Analysis:

* Trajectory: This obstacle is approaching the ego vehicle both longitudinally and laterally. The longitudinal distance decreases from 18.14m to 6.38m, and the lateral distance decreases slightly from 2.10m to 2.15m, but ultimately remains within the same general area. The small variations in lateral distance suggest the vehicles might remain in close lateral proximity. This implies potential risk given the clear longitudinal approach.

* TTC Calculation (Longitudinal): At t=0.9s, longitudinal distance is 6.38m and relative longitudinal velocity is -14.45m/s. TTC = 6.38m / 14.45m/s ≈ 0.44s

* TTC Calculation (Lateral): Lateral movement is minimal and fluctuating, so while the vehicles might be on a collision course, the TTC based on lateral movement is not reliable for accurate prediction due to the slight outward movement at the last timestep. 

* MDC Calculation: Considering the obstacle's primarily longitudinal approach and the overall trajectory, the MDC is primarily determined by the longitudinal distance of 6.38m. However, we still consider the minimal lateral distance of 2.15m as an additional factor to consider into the overall assessment and to avoid neglecting a potential collision.

* Risk Assessment:
    * Longitudinal TTC of 0.44s implies Extreme Risk (1).
    * MDC of 6.38m (longitudinally) and 2.15m (laterally) suggests a Medium Risk (3).
    * Prioritizing the higher risk, the overall risk is Extreme (1).



Collision Scenario Determination:

Both obstacles 30638 and 30640 have an overall risk score of 1 (Extreme Risk) at the last timestamp, and their TTC values are very low (< 0.5 seconds). Therefore, this is a collision scenario.
