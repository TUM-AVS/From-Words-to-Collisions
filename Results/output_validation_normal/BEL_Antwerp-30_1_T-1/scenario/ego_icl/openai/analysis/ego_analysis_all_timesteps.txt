### Obstacle-By-Obstacle Analysis

#### Obstacle 30638

- **Position Analysis (Most Recent Timestep - 0.9s):**
  - Adjusted Longitudinal Distance: 2.80 m
  - Adjusted Lateral Distance: 13.73 m
  - Relative Velocity: Longitudinal -6.19 m/s, Lateral 8.34 m/s
  - Motion: Moving towards ego car longitudinally and moving away laterally

- **Trajectory Analysis:**
  - Longitudinal distance is decreasing over time, which indicates the obstacle is getting closer to the ego vehicle.
  - The obstacle is moving away laterally, increasing from 7.53 m to 13.73 m in the lateral direction over time.

- **TTC Calculation (Longitudinal):**
  - TTC = 2.80 m / |(-6.19) m/s| ≈ 0.45 seconds

- **MDC Calculation:**
  - Since the lateral distance is increasing and won't pose a collision course, the longitudinal distance (minimum of the two proximity values) is used for MDC
  - MDC ≈ 2.80 m

- **Risk Assessment:**
  - Based on TTC (0.45s), this is an Extreme Risk (1) scenario.
  - With an MDC of 2.80 m, the risk reduces, but due to TTC calculation, the final risk score remains at Extreme Risk (1).

#### Obstacle 30640

- **Position Analysis (Most Recent Timestep - 0.9s):**
  - Adjusted Longitudinal Distance: 6.38 m
  - Adjusted Lateral Distance: 2.15 m
  - Relative Velocity: Longitudinal -14.45 m/s, Lateral -0.03 m/s
  - Motion: Driving towards the ego vehicle in both dimensions.

- **Trajectory Analysis:**
  - Longitudinal distance is consistently decreasing, showing it's converging towards the ego vehicle.
  - Lateral distance has minimal change, indicating a stable perpendicular trajectory between ego vehicle and the obstacle.

- **TTC Calculation (Longitudinal):**
  - TTC = 6.38 m / |(-14.45) m/s| ≈ 0.44 seconds

- **MDC Calculation:**
  - Due to consistent longitudinal convergence and small lateral distance, the MDC = 6.38 m

- **Risk Assessment:**
  - With a TTC of 0.44s, this falls into the category of Extreme Risk (1).

### Conclusion

Both obstacles presented an Extreme Risk due to their rapid closing speeds relative to the ego vehicle. Despite neither scenario posing a direct collision at this very moment, their projected paths and velocities suggest imminent potential issues without intervention.

### Collision Scenario Determination

Yes, this is a collision scenario. Both obstacles have a risk score of 1 (Extreme Risk), primarily due to very low TTC values indicating imminent proximity breaches.
