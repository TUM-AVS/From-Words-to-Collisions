Here's the analysis and the JSON output:

**Analysis:**

No obstacle is currently colliding with the ego vehicle.  However, we need to assess the risk of collision in the near future based on trajectories.

* **Obstacle 30756.0:** This obstacle is in a different lanelet (33.0) and its y-coordinate (-97.6011 at t=0.5s) indicates it's moving further away from the ego vehicle's y-coordinate (-94.1384 at t=0.5s).  It appears to pose no immediate threat.

* **Obstacle 30761.0:**  Also in lanelet 33.0. Its y-coordinate (-85.6511 at t=0.5s) shows a significant difference from the ego vehicle, suggesting no immediate collision risk.

* **Obstacle 30766.0:** Located in lanelet 19.0. Although its y-coordinate (-103.1616 at t=0.5s) is somewhat closer to the ego vehicle's, the x-coordinate (313.6573 at t=0.5s) shows increasing separation.  The significant negative acceleration at t=0.5s and t=0.6s suggests it is braking hard, further reducing risk.

* **Obstacle 30769.0:**  In lanelet 441.0.  Its y-coordinate (-104.4361 at t=0.5s) puts it further from the ego vehicle than obstacle 30766.0. The x-coordinate (269.6649 at t=0.5s) shows this obstacle is significantly behind the ego vehicle.

* **Obstacle 30759.0:**  Appears at t=0.7s in lanelet 153.0. Its x-coordinate is rapidly approaching the ego vehicle's (321.7613 at t=0.7s vs. ego's 291.8607), while its y-coordinate (-93.3983) is very close to the ego vehicle's (-93.2361). This represents a very high risk of collision. This obstacle should be flagged as a high risk due to the proximity and direction of travel.
