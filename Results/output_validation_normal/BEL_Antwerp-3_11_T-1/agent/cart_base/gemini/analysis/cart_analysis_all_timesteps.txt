Here's the analysis and the JSON output:

**Analysis:**

No obstacle has collided with the ego vehicle.  We need to look for near-term potential collisions based on trajectories.  Since we have limited future information (only up to 0.9 seconds), we have to extrapolate based on current velocity and acceleration.  

* **Obstacle 30756.0:** This obstacle is in a different lanelet (33.0) than the ego vehicle (1232.0 at the most recent timestamp). Although the y-coordinates are somewhat close, the x-coordinate difference suggests a safe lateral distance. Given the current trajectories, there is no immediate risk of collision. Risk Level: Medium (3) or lower.

* **Obstacle 30761.0:**  Similar to 30756, this obstacle is also in lanelet 33.0. It is also laterally separated, with the x-coordinate difference and differing orientations suggesting a safe distance.  Risk Level: Medium (3) or lower.

* **Obstacle 30766.0:** This obstacle is in lanelet 19.0. Its y-coordinate suggests it may be behind the ego vehicle. While the x-coordinates put it somewhat to the ego vehicle's right, it's crucial to consider the ego vehicle's changing orientation (increasing towards 1.09 radians).  The rapid deceleration of this obstacle (-4.27 m/sÂ²) is also a significant factor that could lead to a risky situation in the near future. Risk Level: High (2) is justified given the unpredictable future trajectory of this obstacle.

* **Obstacle 30769.0:** This obstacle is in lanelet 441.0. The y-coordinates put it further behind the ego vehicle. The x-coordinate also indicates it is significantly to the ego vehicle's left. There's no immediate collision risk. Risk Level: Low (4) or lower.


* **Obstacle 30759.0:** This obstacle appears at t=0.7s in lanelet 153.0. Its x position (around 321) places it significantly ahead of the ego vehicle (around 292). At t=0.9 it is still ahead of the ego but its deceleration could lead to a scenario where the ego catches up in the near future. Still no imminent collision risk yet. Risk Level: Medium (3) or lower.
