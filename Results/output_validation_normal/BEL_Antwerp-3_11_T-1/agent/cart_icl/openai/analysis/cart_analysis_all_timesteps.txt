In the provided scenario, we are given the data at multiple time steps for the ego vehicle and several obstacles. I will conduct an assessment by focusing on the latest available data (at 0.9 seconds) and review the previous data to establish motion trends.

### Risk Analysis:

1. **Obstacle 30759**:
    - Relative Position: Positive in Y direction (ahead of ego). X position is significantly higher than the ego.
    - Situation: This obstacle is not in the immediate path of the ego vehicle.
    - Risk: **Negligible Risk (5)**

2. **Obstacle 30761**:
    - Relative Position: Approximately 11m lateral distance from the ego.
    - Situation: Significant lateral distance and in a different lanelet.
    - Risk: **Negligible Risk (5)**
  
3. **Obstacle 30766**:
    - Relative Position: Around 23.8m ahead, different lanelet.
    - Situation: Far ahead in a different lanelet, accelerating negatively, further reducing speed.
    - Risk: **Negligible Risk (5)**

4. **Obstacle 30769**:
    - Relative Position: Over 20m lateral distance and different lanelet.
    - Situation: Moving away from the ego vehicle.
    - Risk: **Negligible Risk (5)**

5. **Obstacle 30756**:
    - Relative Position: This stationary obstacle is far from the ego spatially and in a different lanelet.
    - Situation: No risk in the current trajectory.
    - Risk: **Negligible Risk (5)**

After reviewing each obstacle's motion trends and relative distances concerning the ego vehicle, there are no immediate threats of collision or high-risk scenarios identified. None of the obstacles are in the same lanelet as the ego, and the spatial distances are significant enough to negate collision risks.

No obstacles are at an immediate high risk or collision level.

### Risk Assessment JSON Output:

```json
{
    "CollisionObstacles": [],
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {},
    "HighRiskObstacle": {}
}
```

Overall, each obstacle is sufficiently distant, both spatially and in terms of trajectory, from the ego vehicle, with negligible risk in the provided frames of reference, resulting in no requirement to mark any obstacles as collision (0) or extreme risk (1).
