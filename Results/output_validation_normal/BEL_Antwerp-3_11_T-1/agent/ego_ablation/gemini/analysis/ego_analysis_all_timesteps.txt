At time 0.9 seconds, obstacle 30759 is located 7.53 meters in front and 23.19 meters to the right of the ego vehicle, moving towards the ego longitudinally at -7.51 m/s and laterally at 8.95 m/s. Although it is approaching the ego vehicle longitudinally, its significant lateral velocity suggests it might be crossing the ego vehicle's path rather than posing an immediate collision threat. Obstacle 30761 is purely lateral to the ego car, at a distance of 10.70 meters, moving away, representing no risk. Similarly, obstacle 30766 is also lateral (to the right) and moving further away, posing no risk. Obstacle 30769 is behind and to the left of the ego vehicle at a longitudinal distance of -14.06 meters and a lateral distance of 11.45 meters. Its motion indicates it is approaching the ego vehicle from behind and to the left, but it's lateral velocity (-4.03 m/s) suggests a lateral movement away from the ego vehicle's trajectory.

Based on the provided data, there is no immediate collision or extreme risk predicted in the next few moments. However, continuous monitoring is crucial, particularly for obstacle 30759 because of its longitudinal closing velocity and the possibility of its lateral motion intersecting with the ego vehicle's future trajectory.
