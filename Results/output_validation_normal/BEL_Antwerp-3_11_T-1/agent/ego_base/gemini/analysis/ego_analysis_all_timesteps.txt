At t=0.9s:
- **Obstacle 30759:** Front-right, 7.53m longitudinal distance, closing at -7.51 m/s.  Lateral distance is -23.19m and moving towards ego laterally at 8.95 m/s.  This obstacle is approaching but not an immediate risk given the current distances and velocities. Medium risk.

- **Obstacle 30761:**  Left, 0.0m longitudinal distance, moving parallel at -13.44 m/s. Lateral distance 10.70m, separating at 5.19 m/s.  No longitudinal risk due to parallel movement, and the lateral distance is increasing. Low risk.

- **Obstacle 30766:** Right, 0.0m longitudinal distance, moving parallel at -5.21 m/s. Lateral distance -24.92m, separating at -5.95 m/s. No longitudinal risk. Low risk.

- **Obstacle 30769:** Rear-left, -14.06m longitudinal distance (behind), approaching at 0.77 m/s. Lateral distance 11.45m, approaching ego laterally at -4.03 m/s. The longitudinal speed difference is small, so the closing is slow.  The lateral movement is also not immediately concerning.  Medium risk.
