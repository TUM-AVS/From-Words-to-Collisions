Let me analyze each obstacle at the most recent timestep (0.9 seconds):

1. Obstacle 30759 (Front-right):
   - Adjusted distances: longitudinal 7.53m, lateral -23.19m
   - Relative velocities: longitudinal -7.51 m/s (approaching), lateral 8.95 m/s (approaching)
   - TTC_longitudinal = 7.53/7.51 ≈ 1.00s (High Risk)
   - TTC_lateral = 23.19/8.95 ≈ 2.59s (Medium Risk)
   - MDC: Both distances are large (>5m), but trajectories are converging
   - Overall Risk: High (2) due to longitudinal TTC

2. Obstacle 30761 (Left):
   - Adjusted distances: longitudinal 0.00m (aligned), lateral 10.70m
   - Relative velocities: longitudinal -13.44 m/s (moving away), lateral 5.19 m/s (moving away)
   - TTC not applicable (moving away in both dimensions)
   - MDC: Lateral distance is large (>5m)
   - Overall Risk: Negligible (5)

3. Obstacle 30766 (Right):
   - Adjusted distances: longitudinal 0.00m (aligned), lateral -24.92m
   - Relative velocities: longitudinal -5.21 m/s, lateral -5.95 m/s (both moving away)
   - TTC not applicable (moving away)
   - MDC: Large lateral distance (>5m)
   - Overall Risk: Negligible (5)

4. Obstacle 30769 (Rear-left):
   - Adjusted distances: longitudinal -14.06m, lateral 11.45m
   - Relative velocities: longitudinal 0.77 m/s (approaching slowly), lateral -4.03 m/s (approaching)
   - TTC_longitudinal = 14.06/0.77 ≈ 18.26s (No Risk)
   - TTC_lateral = 11.45/4.03 ≈ 2.84s (Medium Risk)
   - MDC: Both distances are large (>5m)
   - Overall Risk: Medium (3)

Trajectory Analysis:
- Obstacle 30759 is the most concerning with converging paths from front-right
- Other obstacles are either moving away or at safe distances
- No actual collisions (distance > 0 in all cases)
- No extreme risk (TTC > 0.5s in all cases)
