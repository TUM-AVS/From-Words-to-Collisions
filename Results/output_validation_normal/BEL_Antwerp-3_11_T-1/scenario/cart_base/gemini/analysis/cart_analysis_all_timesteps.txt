At t=0.9s, Ego is at (292.48, -92.17) in lanelet 1232. Let's analyze the obstacle positions and trajectories:

* **Obstacle 30759:** Located at (320.05, -92.82) in lanelet 153.  While fairly close in the y-coordinate, the x-coordinate difference is significant.  Its velocity is decreasing.  Given the lateral separation and deceleration, this obstacle doesn't pose an immediate collision risk.

* **Obstacle 30761:** At (281.21, -87.18) in lanelet 33.  This obstacle is laterally separated and its velocity is decreasing. No immediate collision risk.

* **Obstacle 30766:** At (316.24, -103.99) in lanelet 19.  This obstacle is further away than at previous timesteps and its velocity has significantly decreased.  No immediate risk.

* **Obstacle 30769:** Located at (272.37, -102.70) in lanelet 441.  The trajectory of this obstacle doesn't suggest an immediate collision risk.

Based on the provided data, at t=0.9s, no obstacle poses an immediate collision risk (Risk score 0 or 1).
