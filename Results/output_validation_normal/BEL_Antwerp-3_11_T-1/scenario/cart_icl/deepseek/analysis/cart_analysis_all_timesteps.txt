### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep (0.9 seconds):

### Obstacle Analysis:

1. **Obstacle ID: 30759.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Located at (320.0455, -92.8164), moving away from ego (292.4845, -92.1687). Distance is increasing over time.
   - **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: Velocity (9.0493) is higher than ego's (6.2009), moving in opposite direction (orientation 2.8109 vs ego's 1.0955).
   - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 5

2. **Obstacle ID: 30761.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Located at (281.2075, -87.1774), moving away from ego. Lateral distance is significant (~5m) and increasing.
   - **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: Velocity (8.9023) is higher than ego's, but trajectories are diverging.
   - **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 4

3. **Obstacle ID: 30766.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Located at (316.2399, -103.9951), ~23.7m ahead and ~11.8m laterally. Distance is increasing.
   - **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: Decelerating rapidly (-4.2778), but still moving away from ego.
   - **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 4

4. **Obstacle ID: 30769.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Located at (272.3735, -102.6987), ~20m behind and ~10.5m laterally. Distance is increasing.
   - **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: Velocity (8.0464) is higher than ego's, but moving away.
   - **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 4

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. No obstacles are in the same lanelet as ego (1232.0) at 0.9s.
2. All obstacles are either moving away or maintaining safe distances.
3. No converging trajectories observed in the historical data.
4. Ego is decelerating slightly, further reducing collision risks.
