### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
No obstacles pose an immediate collision risk at the most recent timestep. However, obstacles 30756.0, 30759.0, and 30761.0 require close monitoring due to their proximity and relative motion to the ego vehicle. It is not a collision scenario currently.

### Summary in JSON Format:
