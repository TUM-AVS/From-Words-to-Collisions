### Obstacle Analysis:

#### Obstacle ID: 30755
- **Distance Risk reason**: This obstacle remains significantly distant from the ego vehicle, moving south from a much higher y-coordinate, with no trajectory indicating an approach towards the ego's path.

- **Overall Risk score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 30766
- **Distance Risk reason**: Located further away and continuously moving parallel to the ego car, outside of immediate trajectory threat.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: No risk shows motion parallel with control acceleration reducing additional risk.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 30767
- **Distance Risk reason**: Even with high speeds, this obstacle's trajectory keeps it well out of the course of the ego due to distinct eastward and south positioning.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: High-motion dynamics yet without intersecting future potential paths with the ego.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5
