At t=0.9s, obstacle 30759 is located at longitudinal 7.53m and lateral -23.19m relative to the ego vehicle, approaching longitudinally at -7.51 m/s and laterally at 8.95 m/s.  While it is moving towards the ego car longitudinally, its high lateral velocity suggests a possible crossing trajectory rather than a head-on collision. The lateral distance of -23.19m provides a safety buffer. Hence it's not a collision or extreme risk obstacle.

Obstacle 30761 is purely lateral (9.14m) and moving away at a speed of 5.19 m/s and poses negligible risk.

Obstacle 30766 is purely lateral at -24.92m and moving away laterally. Thus it's not an immediate threat.


Obstacle 30769, however, presents the highest risk. Located at longitudinal -14.06m and lateral 11.45m and closing in longitudinally (0.77 m/s) and laterally (-4.03 m/s), the shrinking distances combined with its movement pattern might lead to a collision if the trends continue. Additional analysis with more future timesteps are needed to determine true risk. At this moment, It does not pose an extreme risk.
