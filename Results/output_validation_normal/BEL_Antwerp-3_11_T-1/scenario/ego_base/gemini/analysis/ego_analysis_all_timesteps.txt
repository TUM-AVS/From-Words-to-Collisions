At t=0.9s, Obstacle 30759 is at longitudinal 7.53m and lateral -23.19m (Front-right) moving towards the ego vehicle longitudinally at -7.51 m/s and laterally at 8.95 m/s. Obstacle 30761 is at lateral 10.70m (Left) and moving away laterally at 5.19 m/s. Obstacle 30766 is at lateral -24.92m (Right) and moving away laterally at -5.95 m/s. Obstacle 30769 is at longitudinal -14.06m and lateral 11.45m (Rear-left) moving towards the ego vehicle longitudinally at 0.77 m/s and laterally at -4.03 m/s.

None of the obstacles pose an immediate collision risk in the next timestep, although 30759 is approaching quickly from the front-right and its lateral movement is bringing it closer.  However,  it is not close enough to be considered an extreme risk at this specific moment.

**Risk Levels and Definitions:**
<Collision (Score: 0)>: Actual collision has occurred or is unavoidable within the next timestep.
<Extreme Risk (Score: 1)>: Immediate collision or very high likelihood of impact. Urgent action is required.
<High Risk (Score: 2)>: Close to collision or highly probable collision path. Needs prompt attention and quick manoeuvring.
<Medium Risk (Score: 3)>: Moderate collision risk but manageable with timely reactions and proper strategies.
<Low Risk (Score: 4)>: Minimal collision risk. The situation is controllable with sufficient time to react.
<Negligible Risk (Score: 5)>: No significant collision risk. Obstacles are either moving away or far enough not to interfere.
