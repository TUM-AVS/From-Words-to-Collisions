### Safety analysis for timestep 0.9 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

**Assumptions and Clarifications:**

* The prompt mentions "adjusted distances" (adjusted_d_long and adjusted_d_lat), but these values are not provided in the scenario context. Therefore, the analysis will be based on the provided "real distance" values (DTClong and DTClat) for longitudinal and lateral distances.
*  TTC calculations will be simplified due to the lack of explicit ego vehicle motion information. Relative velocity will be primarily used to infer risk. Negative TTC values will imply obstacles moving away from the ego vehicle. 
* Lack of vehicle dimensions necessitates a qualitative assessment of MDC. We'll interpret smaller distances coupled with towards-ego motion as higher risk.
* Exact TTC and MDC calculations require more precise data.


### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID:** 30759
- **Distance Risk reason:** Located at 7.53m longitudinally and laterally in the Front-right, relatively close. It's moving towards the ego car longitudinally.
- **Distance safety score:** 3 (Medium Risk)
- **Time Risk reason:** Approaching longitudinally at -7.51 m/s but moving laterally at 8.95 m/s.  Collision likelihood is moderate but depends on the trajectories. 
- **Time safety score:** 3 (Medium Risk)
- **Overall Risk score:** 3 (Medium Risk)

- **Obstacle ID:** 30761
- **Distance Risk reason:**  Exact longitudinal alignment (0.0m). The lateral distance is also 0.0m which indicates a critical situation.
- **Distance safety score:** 1 (Extreme Risk)
- **Time Risk reason:** Moving away laterally at 5.19 m/s which reduces the collision risk.
- **Time safety score:** 2 (High Risk)
- **Overall Risk score:** 2 (High Risk)

- **Obstacle ID:** 30766
- **Distance Risk reason:** Exact longitudinal alignment and 0.0m lateral distance suggest a very high risk of collision.
- **Distance safety score:** 1 (Extreme Risk)
- **Time Risk reason:** Although aligned longitudinally, it's moving away laterally at -5.95 m/s, mitigating some risk.
- **Time safety score:** 2 (High Risk)
- **Overall Risk score:** 2 (High Risk)

- **Obstacle ID:** 30769
- **Distance Risk reason:**  Located -14.06m longitudinally and laterally (Rear-left), suggesting some distance but closing in from behind and the left.
- **Distance safety score:** 3 (Medium Risk)
- **Time Risk reason:**  Driving towards the ego car longitudinally at 0.77 m/s and laterally at -4.03 m/s. The converging trajectories increase the collision risk.
- **Time safety score:** 2 (High Risk)
- **Overall Risk score:** 2 (High Risk)



### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
    "CollisionObstacle": null,
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null,
    "IsCollisionScenario": false,
    "Justification": "While some obstacles (30761 and 30766) exhibit very close proximity at this timestep, the relative lateral motion suggests they are diverging slightly. Obstacle 30769 is approaching but hasn't collided yet. Therefore, this is not classified as a certain collision scenario at this specific moment."
