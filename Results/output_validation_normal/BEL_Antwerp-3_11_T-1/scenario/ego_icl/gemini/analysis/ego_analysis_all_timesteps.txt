* **Obstacle 30759:** This obstacle is approaching from the front-right.  Over the past few timesteps, it has been getting closer longitudinally (13.86m to 7.53m) and its lateral distance has been increasing (21.99m to 23.19m although decreasing slightly in the last time step).  Given the current distances and relative velocities (-7.51 m/s longitudinal, 8.95 m/s lateral), this obstacle poses a medium risk.  Further calculation of TTC and MDC would be required to refine the risk level if adjusted distances were provided.

* **Obstacle 30761:** This obstacle is positioned to the left of the ego vehicle and maintains a consistent lateral distance above 8.98 meters over all time steps. Although the longitudinal distance is 0.00m at each provided timestep, the motion description states the vehicle is moving away laterally to the left while maintaining exact longitudinal alignment. As such, there is no immediate risk of collision with this obstacle.

* **Obstacle 30766:** This obstacle is positioned to the right of the ego vehicle, and is on a near collision path with ego vehicle.  Its longitudinal distance has decreased significantly (12.96m to 0.00m), and the lateral distance has increased, though remaining less than 25 meters. At the latest timestep the longitudinal distance is 0.00m. Despite the exact longitudinal alignment, motion description suggests the vehicle is moving away from the ego vehicle, not towards it. Because the lateral distance is still significant, collision unlikely. Given its relative velocity (-5.21 m/s longitudinal, -5.95 m/s lateral) moving away from the ego vehicle. Although longitudinally aligned at 0.00m, the lateral distance remains fairly constant in all timesteps. There appears to be no immediate collision risk.

* **Obstacle 30769:** This obstacle started behind the ego vehicle and its longitudinal distance has been slightly decreasing (-19.86m to -14.06m) over the time period while its lateral position was originally 0m and is now 11.45 meters.  It is moving closer to the ego vehicle from the rear-left at the last time step. At 0.9s the relative velocity is 0.77 m/s longitudinal and -4.03 m/s lateral, which is small and indicates its moving away laterally. The obstacle's motion does not pose an imminent risk of collision.

**Conclusion:**  While some obstacles are moderately close, none present an extreme risk of collision at the most recent timestep. This is NOT a collision scenario.
