To analyze the risk of collision for each obstacle at the most recent timestep (0.9 seconds), we will evaluate current positions, trajectories, velocities, and distances for each obstacle relative to the ego vehicle.

**Obstacle 30759:**
- **Position:** Front-right, longitudinal 7.53 m, lateral -23.19 m.
- **Relative Velocity:** Longitudinal -7.51 m/s, lateral 8.95 m/s.
- **Motion:** Approaching longitudinally, moving away laterally.

- **TTC (Longitudinal):** 7.53 m / 7.51 m/s = 1.00 sec (rounded).
- **TTC (Lateral):** Not directly applicable as it indicates moving away.
- **MDC:** With a diverging lateral component, the minimum approach is considerably higher than critical thresholds.

- **Risk Analysis:** 
  - Longitudinal TTC suggests a moderate approach but moving away laterally generally indicates a reduced risk, no convergence.
  - **Risk Score:** Low Risk (4).

**Obstacle 30761:**
- **Position:** Left, longitudinal 0.00 m, lateral 10.70 m.
- **Relative Velocity:** Longitudinal -13.44 m/s, lateral 5.19 m/s.
- **Motion:** Exact longitudinal alignment, moving away laterally.

- **TTC (Longitudinal):** Inapplicable due to alignment (no closure).
- **TTC (Lateral):** Not converging, moving away with lateral increasing distance.
- **MDC:** Lateral component is increasing, suggesting diverging paths.

- **Risk Analysis:**
  - With lateral movement away, low risk of intersection.
  - **Risk Score:** No Risk (5).

**Obstacle 30766:**
- **Position:** Right, longitudinal 0.00 m, lateral -24.92 m.
- **Relative Velocity:** Longitudinal -5.21 m/s, lateral -5.95 m/s.
- **Motion:** Exact longitudinal alignment, moving away laterally.

- **TTC (Longitudinal):** Inapplicable, alignment maintained.
- **TTC (Lateral):** Not converging; paths are diverging.
- **MDC:** Safe buffer due to diverging lateral movement.

- **Risk Analysis:**
  - Diverging trajectory mitigates collision risk.
  - **Risk Score:** No Risk (5).

**Obstacle 30769:**
- **Position:** Rear-left, longitudinal -14.06 m, lateral 11.45 m.
- **Relative Velocity:** Longitudinal 0.77 m/s, lateral -4.03 m/s.
- **Motion:** Closing from behind, driving laterally toward.

- **TTC (Longitudinal):** Not critical for collision as relative distance is increasing.
- **TTC (Lateral):** Negative lateral relative velocity indicates potential converging movement.
- **MDC:** Lateral distance decreasing, monitor.

- **Risk Analysis:**
  - Minor longitudinal advance, but lateral motion needs monitoring.
  - **Risk Score:** Medium Risk (3).

Final Analysis:
- No obstacles indicate a collision or extreme risk based on current projections during the latest timestep.
- No imminent collision single handedly indicates extreme immediate danger.

**Conclusion: This is not a collision scenario; all scores are above 2 (High Risk).**
