Obstacle 30763 is consistently close to the ego vehicle and moving in the same direction with similar orientation.  The y-coordinates show a decreasing gap between the two. At t=0.1s, the y distance is about 15 meters; at t=0.9s it's less than 12 meters, despite 30763's slight deceleration. This sustained proximity and converging trajectories suggest a high risk of collision if either vehicle deviates slightly from its current path or velocity. Obstacles 30762 and 30758 remain stationary or significantly far from the ego vehicle's trajectory throughout the provided timeframe, posing negligible collision risks.
