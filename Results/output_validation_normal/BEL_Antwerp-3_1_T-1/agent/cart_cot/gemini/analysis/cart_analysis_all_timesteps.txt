At t=0.9s, the ego vehicle's position is (364.1226, -132.7465) and its orientation is 1.5461511904578835.  We'll analyze each obstacle individually:

**Obstacle 30758.0:** Position (353.6127, -108.5647), velocity (0.1904, we assume it is in x direction and 0.0 in y direction), acceleration (1.9048, we assume it is in x direction and 0.0 in y direction). This obstacle is relatively far from the ego vehicle in both x and y directions, and given its velocity, the distance to the ego vehicle will likely increase. Therefore, this obstacle poses a negligible risk.

**Obstacle 30762.0:** Position (360.3049, -114.541), velocity (0.0, 0.0), acceleration (0.0, 0.0). This obstacle is stationary and poses no immediate threat. Although moderately close to the ego vehicle based on raw distance, the difference in y-coordinates and the ego vehicle's trajectory suggest there is no imminent collision risk. This warrants monitoring but represents a low risk currently.

**Obstacle 30763.0:** Position (363.785, -148.4021), velocity (7.6936 assumed as x velocity, 0.0 y velocity), acceleration (-1.8508 assumed as x acceleration, 0.0 y acceleration).  This obstacle is close to the ego vehicle in x coordinate but significantly different in y coordinate (-148.4021 vs -132.7465). Since they are in different lanes and different y position, this obstacle is assumed to pose a very low risk currently.

**Detailed Analysis for Obstacle 30763.0 (closest in x-coordinate):**

Although the y-coordinates are different, we will perform a simple TTC calculation assuming both vehicles continue their current trajectories in the x direction to highlight the methodology.
* Relative velocity in x: 7.6936 - 6.0291 = 1.6645 m/s (Obstacle 30763.0 is faster)
* Distance in x: 364.1226 - 363.785 = 0.3376 m
* Approximate TTC in x (if they were in the same lane and same y-coordinate) : 0.3376 m / 1.6645 m/s = 0.2028 s.

However, since they are not on a collision course due to the difference in y coordinate and also different lanes, the risk is judged to be low.  If the vehicles were in the same lane, this TTC value would indicate an extremely high risk.
