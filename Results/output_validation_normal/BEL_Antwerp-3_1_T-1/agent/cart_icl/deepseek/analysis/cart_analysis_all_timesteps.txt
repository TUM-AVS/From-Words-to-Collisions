### Analysis:

1. **Obstacle 30762 (Stationary)**:
   - Position: (360.3049, -114.541)
   - The obstacle is stationary and located far from the ego vehicle's path (lateral distance > 20m). No risk of collision.

2. **Obstacle 30758 (Initially Stationary, then starts moving)**:
   - Position: (353.6127, -108.5647)
   - The obstacle is stationary initially and then starts moving slowly (velocity = 0.1904 m/s). It is located far from the ego vehicle's path (lateral distance > 20m). No risk of collision.

3. **Obstacle 30763 (Moving in the same direction as ego)**:
   - Position: (363.785, -148.4021)
   - The obstacle is moving in the same direction as the ego vehicle but is behind the ego vehicle. The relative velocity is small (ego velocity = 6.0291 m/s, obstacle velocity = 7.6936 m/s). The distance between them is increasing over time (from -9.1918m at 0.1s to -15.6556m at 0.9s). No risk of collision.

### Risk Assessment:
- **No collision or extreme risk obstacles** identified in the scenario.
- All obstacles are either stationary or moving in a way that does not pose a risk to the ego vehicle.
