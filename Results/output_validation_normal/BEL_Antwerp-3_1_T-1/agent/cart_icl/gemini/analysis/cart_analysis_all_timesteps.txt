At t=0.9s, the ego vehicle is at (364.1226, -132.7465) with a velocity of 6.0291 m/s and acceleration of -0.7881 m/s².  Let's analyze the risk posed by each obstacle:

* **Obstacle 30758:** Located at (353.6127, -108.5647), it's relatively far from the ego vehicle laterally and longitudinally.  While it's starting to move with a velocity of 0.1904 m/s and acceleration of 1.9048 m/s², the current distance and the ego's trajectory suggest a low risk of collision.

* **Obstacle 30762:** Positioned at (360.3049, -114.541), this obstacle remains stationary. It presents minimal risk due to the significant lateral separation from the ego vehicle's trajectory.

* **Obstacle 30763:**  This obstacle, at (363.785, -148.4021), is behind the ego vehicle and traveling in roughly the same direction with a velocity of 7.6936 and a deceleration of -1.8508 m/s^2.  The Y-coordinate difference is substantial however, which puts this obstacle in a different lane entirely. It appears that both are braking, with Obstacle 30763 doing so rather aggressively.  Given the current distance and difference in y-coordinates, we deem there is no immediate risk of collision with this obstacle, although with the current acceleration of both vehicles, the risk is far from negligible.

Since no obstacles pose an immediate collision risk, the JSON output will reflect scores of 4 or 5 for all obstacles.
