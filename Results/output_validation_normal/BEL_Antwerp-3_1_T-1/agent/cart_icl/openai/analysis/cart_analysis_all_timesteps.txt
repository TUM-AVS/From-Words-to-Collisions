### Analysis

For this analysis, I will focus on the situation at 0.9 seconds and take into account the trends over the previous timestamps.

#### **Ego Vehicle (ID 30755):**  
- Position: (364.1226, -132.7465)
- Orientation: 1.5461 radians
- Velocity: 6.0291 m/s
- Acceleration: -0.7881 m/s²
- Lanelet: 906.0

**Obstacle 30758:**  
- Position: (353.6127, -108.5647)
- Orientation & Velocity: 0.1904 m/s (recently began moving)
- Lanelet: 915.0  
- Since obstacle 30758 is static and located in a separate lanelet with a significant positional difference, it presents no risk of collision.

**Obstacle 30762:**  
- Position: (360.3049, -114.541)
- Velocity: 0.0 m/s  
- Lanelet: 22.0  
- This obstacle is stationary and does not intersect with Ego’s trajectory or lane. No immediate risk.

**Obstacle 30763:**  
- Position: (363.785, -148.4021)
- Orientation: 1.551 radians (similar to Ego)
- Velocity: 7.6936 m/s (moving in similar direction but different lanelet)
- Lanelet: 5.0  
- Distance to Ego: Approximately 15.66 meters along the Y-axis with no intersecting lanelet
- Though moving in parallel, it's in a separate lanelet and at a notable distance ensuring no immediate risk.
   
#### **TTC and MDC Calculation:**

- **Obstacle 30763:**    
  - Lateral distance from Ego is significant, and there appears to be no direct collision course due to differing lanelets, hence very low risk.
  - The gap increase implies both are on slightly diverging paths. Given the lack of lanelet overlap and broader spatial separation, no TTC risk.

### Conclusion

There are no significant risks for collisions at the current trajectory and conditions. Based on given data, all obstacles hold a negligible risk score.
