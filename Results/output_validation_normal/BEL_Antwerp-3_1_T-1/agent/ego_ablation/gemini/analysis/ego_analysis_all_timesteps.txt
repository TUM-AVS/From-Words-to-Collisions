At t=0.9s, Obstacle 30762 is the closest to the ego vehicle, at a longitudinal distance of 13.60m and a lateral distance of 2.66m, approaching at -6.03 m/s longitudinally.  While this is a considerable closing speed and warrants attention, a collision is not imminent within the next few timesteps (assuming a timestep of 0.1s). Obstacle 30763 is approaching from behind, at -11.15m longitudinally and closing at 1.66 m/s, but poses no immediate collision risk due to being directly behind. Obstacle 30758, while also approaching longitudinally, is much further away and poses no immediate risk. Overall, no obstacle presents an extreme or collision risk in the immediate next timestep.
