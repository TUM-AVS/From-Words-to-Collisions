At t=0.9s, Obstacle 30762 is in the front-left, approaching the ego car longitudinally at -6.03 m/s with a distance of 13.6m.  This represents a high risk as the closing velocity is significant and the distance is relatively short. Although there is no lateral movement currently, the lateral acceleration is 0.79 m/sÂ², suggesting a potential lateral movement soon.

Obstacle 30758 is also in the front-left and moving towards the ego vehicle longitudinally. It is further away at 19.41m but exhibiting a slight lateral movement away from the ego car. The longitudinal velocity is -5.90 m/s which is slightly slower than 30762. Due to increased distance and slight lateral movement away from ego, its risk is considered medium.

Obstacle 30763 is behind the ego vehicle at -11.15m and approaching with a longitudinal velocity of 1.66 m/s. While it is approaching, the distance and relatively slower speed classify it as a medium risk currently.
