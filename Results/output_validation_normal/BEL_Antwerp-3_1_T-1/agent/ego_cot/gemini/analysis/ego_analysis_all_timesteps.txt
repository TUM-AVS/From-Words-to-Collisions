### Safety analysis for timestep 0.9 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 30758**
- Distance Risk reason: Located 19.41m longitudinally and 19.41m laterally (front-left) relative to the ego vehicle.  This distance presents no immediate danger, but warrants monitoring due to the approaching longitudinal velocity.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Approaching at -5.90 m/s longitudinally, resulting in a TTClong of roughly 3.3 seconds. Laterally moving away at 0.14 m/s.  Provides ample time to react.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4


- **Obstacle ID: 30762**
- Distance Risk reason:  Located 13.60m longitudinally and 13.60m laterally (front-left).  The decreasing longitudinal distance requires attention.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: Approaching at -6.03 m/s longitudinally, giving a TTClong of approximately 2.3 seconds. No lateral movement. Requires proactive monitoring and potential adjustments in trajectory.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3


- **Obstacle ID: 30763**
- Distance Risk reason: Located -11.15m longitudinally (behind) and -11.15m laterally.  While behind, the closing longitudinal distance raises concern.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: Closing the distance at 1.66 m/s longitudinally, leading to a concerningly short TTClong of roughly -6.7 seconds. This indicates that the obstacle will overtake or potentially collide with the ego vehicle from behind relatively soon. The lateral motion is minimal. Immediate awareness and appropriate response are crucial to mitigating potential collision risk.
- Time safety score: 2
- Overall Risk score: 2
