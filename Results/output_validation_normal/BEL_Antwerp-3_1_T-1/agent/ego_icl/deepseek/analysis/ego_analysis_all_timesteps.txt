Let me analyze each obstacle at the most recent timestep (0.9 seconds):

1. Obstacle 30758 (Front-left):
   - Adjusted distances: longitudinal 19.41m, lateral 9.49m
   - Relative velocity: longitudinal -5.90 m/s (approaching), lateral 0.14 m/s (moving away)
   - Motion: Driving toward ego longitudinally, moving away laterally
   - TTC (longitudinal): 19.41/5.90 = 3.29s (Medium Risk)
   - MDC: Lateral distance is large (9.49m) and increasing â†’ No Risk
   - Overall Risk: Medium (3) from longitudinal approach

2. Obstacle 30762 (Front-left):
   - Adjusted distances: longitudinal 13.60m, lateral 2.66m
   - Relative velocity: longitudinal -6.03 m/s (approaching), lateral 0.00 m/s
   - Motion: Driving toward ego longitudinally, no lateral motion
   - TTC (longitudinal): 13.60/6.03 = 2.25s (Medium Risk)
   - MDC: Lateral distance is stable at 2.66m (Medium Risk)
   - Overall Risk: Medium (3) from both dimensions

3. Obstacle 30763 (Behind):
   - Adjusted distances: longitudinal -11.15m, lateral 0.00m
   - Relative velocity: longitudinal 1.66 m/s (approaching), lateral 0.04 m/s
   - Motion: Driving toward ego from behind, exact lateral alignment
   - TTC (longitudinal): 11.15/1.66 = 6.72s (No Risk)
   - MDC: Lateral distance is 0.00m but relative lateral velocity is minimal
   - Overall Risk: Low (4) due to slow approach from behind

Trajectory Analysis:
- All obstacles are maintaining stable trajectories
- No sudden changes in velocity or direction
- No imminent collisions detected
- Highest risk is from Obstacle 30762 with medium risk in both dimensions
