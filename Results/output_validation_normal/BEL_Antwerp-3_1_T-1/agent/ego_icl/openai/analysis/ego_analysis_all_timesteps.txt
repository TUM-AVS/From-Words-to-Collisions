### Obstacle-by-Obstacle Analysis

#### Obstacle 30758
- **Location & Movement**: Front-left, moving toward the ego vehicle. 
- **Adjusted Distances at 0.9s**: Longitudinal = 19.41 m, Lateral = 9.49 m
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal = -5.90 m/s (approaching), Lateral = 0.14 m/s (moving away to the left)
- **Trajectory Analysis**: The obstacle is approaching longitudinally but moving laterally away.
- **TTC Calculation**: Longitudinal TTC = 19.41 / 5.90 ≈ 3.29 seconds
- **MDC Calculation**: Since the lateral distance is increasing and the longitudinal TTC indicates enough reaction time, the MDC is mainly influenced by longitudinal distance.
- **Risk Assessment**: Longitudinal distance and increasing lateral movement indicate a Low risk based on both TTC and MDC. Risk Score: 4

#### Obstacle 30762
- **Location & Movement**: Front-left, moving toward the ego vehicle.
- **Adjusted Distances at 0.9s**: Longitudinal = 13.60 m, Lateral = 2.66 m
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal = -6.03 m/s (approaching), Lateral = 0.00 m/s (no movement)
- **Trajectory Analysis**: The obstacle is consistently closing in on the ego vehicle.
- **TTC Calculation**: Longitudinal TTC = 13.60 / 6.03 ≈ 2.26 seconds
- **MDC Calculation**: The obstacle maintains a narrow lateral offset, focusing on the longitudinal distance is key for MDC.
- **Risk Assessment**: Both TTC and MDC suggest a Medium risk due to the converging trajectory with TTC < 3 seconds. Risk Score: 3

#### Obstacle 30763
- **Location & Movement**: Behind, moving toward the ego vehicle from exact lateral alignment.
- **Adjusted Distances at 0.9s**: Longitudinal = -11.15 m (indicating behind the ego), Lateral = 0.00 m
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal = 1.66 m/s (approaching), Lateral = 0.04 m/s
- **Trajectory Analysis**: Driving from behind with increasing speed.
- **TTC Calculation**: Longitudinal TTC = 11.15 / 1.66 ≈ 6.72 seconds
- **MDC Calculation**: Given the ego vehicle is ahead and the relative velocity is steady, no imminent collision is indicated.
- **Risk Assessment**: With a high longitudinal distance and a TTC > 5 seconds, the risk is Negligible. Risk Score: 5
