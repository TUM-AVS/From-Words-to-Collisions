Obstacle 30763 is showing signs of being a potential extreme risk. While not immediately colliding at t=0.9s, its position (363.785, -148.4021) is very close to the ego vehicle's position (364.1226, -132.7465).  Furthermore, obstacle 30763's sudden deceleration (-1.8508) suggests potential erratic behavior increasing the risk of a near-term collision if this trend continues. Although the ego vehicle is also decelerating, the closing distance and relative velocities warrant concern.
