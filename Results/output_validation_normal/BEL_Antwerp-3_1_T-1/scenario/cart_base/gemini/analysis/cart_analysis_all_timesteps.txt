Obstacle 30763 is showing signs of being a potential extreme risk.  Ego and Obstacle 30763 are moving in the same direction with similar orientations (approximately 1.55 radians), but 30763 is positioned slightly behind Ego and in a different lane (lanelet 5 vs. Ego's lanelet 906). Although the lateral distance appears small,  the trajectories suggest that a lane change by either vehicle could lead to an immediate collision. Obstacle 30758 and 30762 are stationary and far enough away to not pose an immediate threat.
