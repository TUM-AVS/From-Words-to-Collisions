### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:
- **Obstacle ID: 30758.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is stationary (velocity ~0) and located far from the ego vehicle's trajectory (X: 353.6127 vs Ego's X: 364.1226). Over time, the distance has remained large, and the obstacle is not in the same lanelet.
  - **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: The obstacle is stationary, and the ego vehicle is moving away. No risk of collision.
  - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 30762.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is stationary (velocity = 0) and located far from the ego vehicle's trajectory (Y: -114.541 vs Ego's Y: -132.7465). Over time, the distance has remained large, and the obstacle is not in the same lanelet.
  - **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: The obstacle is stationary, and the ego vehicle is moving away. No risk of collision.
  - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 30763.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is moving in the same general direction as the ego vehicle (similar orientation) but is behind the ego (Y: -148.4021 vs Ego's Y: -132.7465). Over time, the distance has been increasing, indicating the obstacle is falling further behind.
  - **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: The obstacle's velocity (7.6936) is slightly higher than the ego's (6.0291), but the distance is increasing due to the obstacle's deceleration (-1.8508). No immediate risk.
  - **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low Risk)

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. **Obstacle 30758.0 and 30762.0**: Both are stationary and far from the ego's path. No collision risk.
2. **Obstacle 30763.0**: Moving in the same direction but behind the ego. The distance is increasing, and the obstacle is decelerating. No collision risk.
3. **Ego Behavior**: The ego is decelerating but maintaining a safe distance from all obstacles.
4. **Conclusion**: No collision or extreme risk scenarios detected.
