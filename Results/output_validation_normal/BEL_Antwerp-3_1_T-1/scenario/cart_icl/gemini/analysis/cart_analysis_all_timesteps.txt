### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
The ego vehicle is moving forward and decelerating. It changes from lanelet 905.0 to 7.0, and finally, arrives at 906.0 in 0.5 seconds. No obstacles are in the same lanelet or on a direct collision course with the ego vehicle based on observed trajectories and lanelets.
