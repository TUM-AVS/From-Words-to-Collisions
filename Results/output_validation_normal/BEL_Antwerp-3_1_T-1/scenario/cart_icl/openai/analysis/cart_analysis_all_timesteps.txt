### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
Upon examining different obstacles, none posed a direct, immediate collision scenario. Trajectories indicate distinct paths from Ego or distances are substantial from the vehicle's lanelet currently. 

### Summary in JSON Format:

```json
{
    "CollisionObstacles": null,
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null,
    "ScenarioAnalysis": {
        "IsCollisionScenario": false,
        "Reasoning": "No obstacles on a collision course with Ego vehicle primarily due to separate trajectories or substantial distances."
    }
}
```

All obstacles are equally contained within their lanes or exhibit minimal engagement with Ego over the evaluated period, suggesting a scenario devoid of collision events.
