Obstacle 30762 is in the front-left of the ego vehicle, approaching longitudinally with a decreasing relative velocity.  The lateral distance is small (2.66 m) but not alarming given the current lack of lateral relative motion. However, the longitudinal distance is decreasing rapidly (13.60 m with a relative velocity of -6.03 m/s), indicating potential for a collision in the near future if this trend continues.

Obstacle 30763 is behind the ego vehicle and is very close longitudinally (-11.15m). It's slowly gaining on the ego vehicle (relative longitudinal velocity 1.66 m/s). Though not immediately dangerous, this obstacle requires monitoring.

Obstacle 30758 is further away than the others and poses less of an immediate risk.  While moving towards the ego longitudinally, it's also moving slightly away laterally.
