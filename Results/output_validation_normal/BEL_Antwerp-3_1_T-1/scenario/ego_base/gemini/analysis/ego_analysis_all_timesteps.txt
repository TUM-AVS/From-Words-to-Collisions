Obstacle 30762 is in the Front-left and closing in longitudinally at -6.03 m/s with a longitudinal distance of 13.60 m.  At this closing rate, a collision could occur in approximately 2.25 seconds if speeds remain constant. This represents a high risk. Obstacle 30758 is further away longitudinally (19.41m) but also closing at -5.90 m/s, posing a medium risk. Obstacle 30763, while behind the ego vehicle, is approaching quite rapidly (1.66 m/s) and is now at -11.15 m. This warrants attention, but the risk is lower compared to the front obstacles due to greater ability to maneuver.

Obstacle 30758 presents a medium risk with similar closing speed but greater distance. Obstacle 30763 is approaching rapidly from behind, warranting attention."
