### Safety analysis for timestep 0.9 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

There are no adjusted distances provided in the context. Therefore, the raw longitudinal and lateral distances will be used for this analysis, along with relative velocities and accelerations.  This may lead to less precise risk assessments. It is strongly recommended to provide adjusted distances in future queries for a more accurate collision analysis.

**Assumptions**: Since adjusted distances are missing, I will assume a vehicle size of 4m longitudinally and 2m laterally to create an estimate of risk, as this is crucial for proper TTC calculations. I'll also assume that "Front-left" implies the obstacle is primarily in front, slightly to the left, and a similar logic applies to other combined directions.


### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 30758**
    - Distance Risk reason: Located 19.41m longitudinally and 19.41m laterally in the front-left.  Considering the assumed vehicle size, this represents a moderately safe distance.
    - Distance safety score: 4
    - Time Risk reason: Approaching longitudinally at -5.90 m/s, but moving away laterally at 0.14 m/s.  Longitudinal TTC is roughly 3.29 seconds (19.41m / 5.9 m/s). Lateral movement is diverging.
    - Time safety score: 4
    - Overall Risk score: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 30762**
    - Distance Risk reason: At 13.60m longitudinally and 13.60m laterally in the front-left, this represents a closer distance and hence a higher risk than obstacle 30758.
    - Distance safety score: 3
    - Time Risk reason: Closing longitudinally at -6.03 m/s. Longitudinal TTC is approximately 2.25 seconds (13.60m / 6.03 m/s). No lateral movement.
    - Time safety score: 3
    - Overall Risk score: 3

- **Obstacle ID: 30763**
    - Distance Risk reason: Located behind the ego vehicle at -11.15m longitudinally and -11.15m laterally. This presents a moderate risk due to the proximity.
    - Distance safety score: 3
    - Time Risk reason: Approaching at 1.66 m/s longitudinally and minimal relative lateral velocity.  Since this obstacle is approaching from behind, a negative relative longitudinal velocity is expected for collision risk assessment. TTC is approximately -6.72s which, in this case, isn't a conventional TTC as it implies divergence in the immediate future, hence no immediate collision threat from the rear. 
    - Time safety score: 4
    - Overall Risk score: 4


### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
    "CollisionObstacle": null,
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null,
    "IsCollisionScenario": false,
    "Justification": "No obstacle poses an immediate collision risk. All obstacles have TTC values that provide sufficient time for maneuvering, assuming standard vehicle dynamics and reaction times. However, obstacle 30762 requires monitoring due to its closer proximity and approach speed."
