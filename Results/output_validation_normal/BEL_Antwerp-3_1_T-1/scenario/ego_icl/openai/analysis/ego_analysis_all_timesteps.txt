To evaluate the collision risks based on the provided scenario, we will analyze the trajectory of each obstacle at the most recent timestep (0.9 seconds), taking into account their adjusted distances and velocities.

### Obstacle-by-Obstacle Analysis

#### Obstacle 30758:
- **Position at 0.9 seconds:**
  - **Relative Direction:** Front-left
  - **Adjusted Longitudinal Distance:** Approximately 19.41 m
  - **Adjusted Lateral Distance:** Approximately 9.49 m
  - **Relative Velocity:** Longitudinal: -5.90 m/s (approaching), Lateral: 0.14 m/s (moving left)
  - **Motion Description:** Driving toward the ego car longitudinally, moving away laterally to the left.

- **Trajectory Analysis:**
  - Longitudinal distance decreasing due to negative velocity, lateral distance increasing as the obstacle moves left.
  - Given the relatively large longitudinal distance and lateral divergence, the risk of imminent collision is low.

- **Calculations:**
  - **Time-to-Collision (TTC):** Longitudinal TTC = distance / |velocity| = 19.41 / 5.90 = 3.29 seconds
  - **Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC):** As the lateral distance is increasing (9.49 m), MDC is significant.

- **Risk Assessment:** 
  - **Longitudinal Risk:** Medium Risk (TTC < 3.0s)
  - **Lateral Risk:** No Risk (diverging laterally)
  - **Overall Risk Score:** Lowest is Medium Risk (3)

#### Obstacle 30762:
- **Position at 0.9 seconds:**
  - **Relative Direction:** Front-left
  - **Adjusted Longitudinal Distance:** Approximately 13.60 m
  - **Adjusted Lateral Distance:** Approximately 2.66 m
  - **Relative Velocity:** Longitudinal: -6.03 m/s (approaching)
  - **Motion Description:** Driving toward the ego car longitudinally, no lateral motion.

- **Trajectory Analysis:**
  - Both longitudinal and lateral distances are decreasing.
  - Shorter longitudinal distance compared to Obstacle 30758, implying higher risk.

- **Calculations:**
  - **Time-to-Collision (TTC):** Longitudinal TTC = distance / |velocity| = 13.60 / 6.03 = 2.26 seconds
  - **Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC):** Still safe but medium distance due to decreasing trajectory.

- **Risk Assessment:** 
  - **Longitudinal Risk:** Medium Risk (TTC < 3.0s)
  - **Overall Risk Score:** Medium Risk (3)

#### Obstacle 30763:
- **Position at 0.9 seconds:**
  - **Relative Direction:** Behind
  - **Adjusted Longitudinal Distance:** Approximately -11.15 m
  - **Adjusted Lateral Distance:** 0.00 m (aligned)
  - **Relative Velocity:** Longitudinal: 1.66 m/s (approaching)

- **Trajectory Analysis:**
  - Obstacle has slight longitudinal approach, given low velocity and distance.
  - Exact lateral alignment poses a risk if the ego car decelerates.

- **Calculations:**
  - **Time-to-Collision (TTC):** Longitudinal TTC not immediately critical due to slow approach.
  - **Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC):** Lateral alignment confirms potential risk if trajectory changes.

- **Risk Assessment:** 
  - **Longitudinal Risk:** High Risk (Longitudinal alignment close but slow approach)
  - **Overall Risk Score:** High Risk (2)

### Conclusion: Collision Scenario Determination

- **Collision Criterion:**
  - **No obstacles** have a score of 0 (Collision) or 1 (Extreme Risk).
  - Obstacle 30763 scores 2, which suggests monitoring.

- **Collision Scenario:** No imminent collision detected as per defined criteria.
