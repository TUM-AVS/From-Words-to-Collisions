Obstacle 30663 is in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle and initially poses a potential risk.  At t=0.1s, it's relatively close and accelerating towards the ego vehicle. However, by analyzing the subsequent timestamps, we see that while it continues to accelerate, its lateral movement doesn't suggest an imminent collision. Although the distance is closing, the rate isn't alarming enough to classify as extreme or collision. Further calculations and a larger prediction horizon might be needed for complete certainty.

Obstacle 30670 is also in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle and initially close behind. While its acceleration fluctuates, it generally remains behind the ego vehicle. The distance and relative velocities do not suggest an immediate collision risk.

Obstacle 30671 is behind the ego vehicle in the same lanelet.  Its behavior appears stable, and it doesn't pose an immediate threat.

Obstacle 30660 starts in a different lanelet, posing no risk.  It changes to lanelet 197.0, but remains far from the ego vehicle.

Obstacle 30668 is in a different lanelet throughout and doesn't present a risk.

Obstacle 30662 appears at t=0.9s in a different lanelet and does not pose a risk within the provided timeframe.
