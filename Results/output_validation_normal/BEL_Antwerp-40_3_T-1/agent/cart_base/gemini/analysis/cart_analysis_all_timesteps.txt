Obstacle 30663 is in the same lanelet (195) as the ego vehicle and initially poses a potential risk. At t=0.1s, it's at (356.9027, 540.2696) while the ego vehicle is at (352.1695, 549.9179).  The obstacle's velocity is initially lower than the ego vehicle's but it is accelerating at 1.5669 while the ego is decelerating.

By t=0.9s, obstacle 30663 has moved to lanelet 1045, seemingly crossing over or changing lanes.  While its velocity has increased significantly to 6.9362, its changing lanelet indicates it's no longer a direct threat of collision.

Obstacle 30670 is also in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle and its initial position is behind the ego vehicle, but very close. While 30670 starts with a lower velocity than the ego vehicle, its acceleration fluctuates significantly. This erratic acceleration pattern, particularly at the beginning of the timeframe, suggests a potential for unpredictable behavior that deserves attention. The fluctuating acceleration of this obstacle requires continuous monitoring.

Obstacle 30671 is located behind the ego vehicle in the same lanelet. It also has lower velocity than the ego vehicle, but its acceleration is also fluctuating. The position is not that close to the ego vehicle to be a high risk.
