Here's a collision risk analysis of the provided scenario focusing on the last timestep (0.9 seconds), utilizing previous timesteps to inform trajectory predictions:

**Ego Vehicle State at t=0.9s:**
* Position: (353.3585, 547.2579)
* Velocity: 3.5494 (units assumed to be m/s)
* Acceleration: -0.0012 (units assumed to be m/s^2)
* Orientation: -1.1356 rad

**Obstacles Analysis at t=0.9s:**

* **Obstacle 30660:**
    * Position: (366.4362, 522.1545)
    * Velocity: 7.4148
    * Acceleration: -0.2332
    * Lanelet: 197.0
    * Analysis: This obstacle is on a different lanelet (197) than the ego vehicle (195). The lateral separation is significant and increasing.  While the longitudinal distance is closing given the obstacle's higher velocity, the different lanelets and lateral motion suggest minimal risk in the short term.

* **Obstacle 30662:**
    * Position: (381.9612, 539.2324)
    * Velocity: 4.2159
    * Acceleration: 1.2769
    * Lanelet: 266.0
    * Analysis: This obstacle is also on a different lanelet (266). It's further away from the ego vehicle than Obstacle 30660 and the trajectories suggest divergence, indicating a low risk.

* **Obstacle 30663:**
    * Position: (359.2568, 535.9016)
    * Velocity: 6.9362
    * Acceleration: 1.9586
    * Lanelet: 1045.0
    * Analysis:  This obstacle is catching up to the ego vehicle. The accelerating nature of this obstacle warrants observation, as it could pose a medium risk.

* **Obstacle 30668:**
    * Position: (371.5854, 534.9581)
    * Velocity: 3.4239
    * Acceleration: -0.559
    * Lanelet: 266.0
    * Analysis: Similar to Obstacle 30662, this obstacle is on a different lanelet with diverging trajectory, indicating a low risk.

* **Obstacle 30670:**
    * Position: (349.1246, 556.9935)
    * Velocity: 3.3678
    * Acceleration: -2.5001
    * Lanelet: 195.0
    * Analysis: This obstacle is in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle and ahead. Although the obstacle is decelerating rapidly, its current motion suggests a low risk.

* **Obstacle 30671:**
    * Position: (345.0441, 567.2432)
    * Velocity: 3.4825
    * Acceleration: -1.2558
    * Lanelet: 195.0
    * Analysis: This obstacle is also ahead of the ego vehicle and decelerating but sufficiently spaced in front of the ego vehicle. No immediate concern but warrants a risk score of medium.
