At t=0.9s, the ego vehicle's position is (353.3585, 547.2579) with a velocity of 3.5494 m/s.  Let's analyze the obstacles:

* **Obstacle 30660:** Located in lanelet 197, this obstacle is laterally separated and poses no immediate risk.  Its longitudinal motion doesn't suggest a likely future collision.

* **Obstacle 30662:**  New obstacle appearing at t=0.9s in lanelet 266, laterally separated and no immediate risk.

* **Obstacle 30663:** In lanelet 1045 (previously 195), indicating a lane change.  While it's moving faster than the ego vehicle, its lateral movement reduces the risk.  Medium risk due to the lane change dynamics.

* **Obstacle 30668:**  Located in lanelet 266 and laterally separated, posing no immediate risk.

* **Obstacle 30670:** Located in the same lanelet (195) as the ego vehicle. Its position is behind the ego vehicle, but it has been consistently accelerating up to t=0.5s, before decelerating heavily.  It is not immediately dangerous due to their relative positions.

* **Obstacle 30671:** Located in the same lanelet (195) as the ego vehicle, and behind obstacle 30670, it initially poses no immediate threat.

Given that no obstacle poses an immediate collision risk (TTC close to 0) and sufficient lateral separation exists where needed, all obstacles except 30663 are assigned scores of 4 or 5. Obstacle 30663 receives a score of 3 due to the lane change dynamics and the potential for future interaction.  The closest obstacle in the same lane is 30670 and obstacle 30671, but their current behavior and location suggests no immediate danger.
