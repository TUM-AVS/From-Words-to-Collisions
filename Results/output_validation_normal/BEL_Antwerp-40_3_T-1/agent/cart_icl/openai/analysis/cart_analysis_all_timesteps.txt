In the provided scenario, we will analyze the positions and velocities of the obstacles with respect to the ego vehicle at the most recent time step, 0.9 seconds, to identify potential collision risks. The ego vehicle is located at position (353.3585, 547.2579) with a velocity of 3.5494 m/s and is in lanelet 195.0. We will calculate TTC and assess MDC for each obstacle relative to the ego vehicle.

Let's analyze each obstacle:

1. **Obstacle 30660.0**:
   - Current position: (366.4362, 522.1545), velocity: 7.4148 m/s.
   - Lanelet: 197.0, which suggests it's in a different lane from the ego vehicle.
   - Approximate longitudinal distance from the ego: 25.82 m.
   - No immediate collision risk due to different lane and sufficient distance.

2. **Obstacle 30662.0**:
   - Current position: (381.9612, 539.2324), velocity: 4.2159 m/s.
   - Lanelet: 266.0, so no immediate collision risk due to clear separation in lanelets.

3. **Obstacle 30663.0**:
   - Current position: (359.2568, 535.9016), velocity: 6.9362 m/s.
   - Lanelet: 1045.0, indicates likely diverging paths.
   - Longitudinal distance is approximately 11.65 m. Despite relatively closer distance, it's closing rate and different trajectory mitigate immediate risk.
   - MDC does not indicate imminent collision due to separate trajectories and sufficient gap.

4. **Obstacle 30668.0**:
   - Current position: (371.5854, 534.9581), velocity: 3.4239 m/s.
   - Lanelet: 266.0 indicates separation.
   - The obstacle is neither approaching the ego vehicle laterally nor longitudinally.

5. **Obstacle 30670.0**:
   - Current position: (349.1246, 556.9935), velocity: 3.3678 m/s.
   - Lanelet: 195.0, same as the ego vehicle.
   - Approximate longitudinal distance from the ego: 10.1 m, behind the ego vehicle, minor closing due to negative acceleration of the obstacle.
   - TTC calculations indicate safe values unless abrupt acceleration changes occur.

6. **Obstacle 30671.0**:
   - Current position: (345.0441, 567.2432), velocity: 3.4825 m/s.
   - Also located in lanelet 195.0 with roughly 20 m distance behind the ego vehicle.
   - Adequate distance maintained with minor risk of immediately reaching the ego path.

**Brief Explanation for Score 0 or 1:**
- None of the obstacles pose an extreme risk (score 1) or collision (score 0) for this timestep, based on MDC, TTC, and lanelet considerations.
