At t=0.9s, Obstacle 30668 is the most critical obstacle. It's approaching the ego car both longitudinally and laterally, with a longitudinal distance of 14.33m and a lateral distance of 9.73m.  While not immediately colliding, the closing velocity (-3.66 m/s longitudinally, -3.42 m/s laterally) suggests a potential high risk if the current trajectories continue, necessitating close monitoring. Obstacle 30662, while further away longitudinally (14.83 m) has a greater lateral distance (20.94 m) and slightly higher closing speeds (-3.77 m/s longitudinally, -4.21 m/s laterally). However, given its position relative to the ego car and the larger lateral separation, it presents a lower risk than obstacle 30668 at this specific timestep. Obstacles 30660 and 30663 are moving away longitudinally and therefore not currently high risk, and the behind objects are also not an immediate concern.
