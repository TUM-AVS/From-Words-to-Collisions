At t=0.9s, Obstacle 30668 is closest to the ego vehicle with a longitudinal distance of 14.33m and a lateral distance of 9.73m. It's approaching the ego car both longitudinally and laterally.  Given its continuous approach over the past time steps, it represents a potential risk. However, the distances and relative velocity suggest there is still time to react, placing it in the High-Risk category. Other obstacles are further away and moving away longitudinally, presenting less immediate concern. Obstacle 30662 enters the scene at this timestep and requires monitoring, but its lateral distance is significant. Obstacle 30670 is behind the ego car and relatively close, but it's currently moving away, though its motion has fluctuated in previous timesteps.
