### Safety analysis for timestep 0.9 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

**Assumptions and Clarifications:**

* Since adjusted distances (adjusted_d_long, adjusted_d_lat) are not provided in the scenario context, the provided real distances (DTClong, DTClat) will be used for this analysis.  It's *highly recommended* to incorporate adjusted distances for a more realistic evaluation in a real-world application.
*  TTC calculations are simplified due to the lack of adjusted distances and vehicle dimensions.  A more sophisticated TTC calculation would involve predicting future vehicle positions and considering their shapes.
* I'm assuming that a negative longitudinal distance means the obstacle is behind the ego vehicle, and a negative lateral distance means the obstacle is to the right of the ego vehicle.


### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 30660**
    - Distance Risk reason:  Located 23.77m longitudinally and 23.77m laterally in front of the ego vehicle.  Poses no immediate distance-based risk.
    - Distance safety score: 5
    - Time Risk reason: Moving away longitudinally and only slightly towards the ego vehicle laterally.
    - Time safety score: 5
    - Overall Risk score: 5

    - Overall Risk score: 3

- **Obstacle ID: 30670**
    - Distance Risk reason: At -6.11m longitudinally and laterally (behind), it's relatively close but behind the ego vehicle.
    - Distance safety score: 4
    - Time Risk reason:  Moving away longitudinally, posing no immediate risk.
    - Time safety score: 4
    - Overall Risk score: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 30671**
    - Distance Risk reason: At -17.12m longitudinally and laterally (behind), it poses no immediate risk.
    - Distance safety score: 5
    - Time Risk reason: Moving slightly towards the ego vehicle longitudinally, but the distance is significant.
    - Time safety score: 4
    - Overall Risk score: 4
