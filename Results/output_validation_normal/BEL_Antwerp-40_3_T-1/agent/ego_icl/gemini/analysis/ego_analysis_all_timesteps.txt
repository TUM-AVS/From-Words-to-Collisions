* **Obstacle 30660:** This obstacle is in front and moving away longitudinally, but its lateral motion shows it's approaching the ego vehicle from the left.  Over the past 0.9 seconds, the lateral distance has decreased significantly from 1.00m to 0.00m. The longitudinal distance shows no concern. Given the lateral velocity of -0.34 m/s and distance of 0.00m, TTC is 0s.  MDC is approximately 0m. This indicates a potential collision or extremely close pass. Risk level: 1 (Extreme Risk).

* **Obstacle 30662:** This is a new obstacle appearing only at 0.9 seconds, located to the front-left.  With a longitudinal distance of 14.83m and a lateral distance of 20.94m, immediate risk is low.  However, both the longitudinal and lateral velocities are negative (towards the ego vehicle). It's essential to monitor this obstacle in the subsequent timesteps.  TTC calculation needs adjusted distances, which aren't provided. Conservatively considering the closing velocities and distances, the risk level is currently assessed as 4 (Low risk) due to the distances, but needs further monitoring due to negative velocities.

* **Obstacle 30663:**  Located in front of the ego vehicle and moving away longitudinally, this obstacle presents minimal risk. The longitudinal distance has been increasing over the timesteps. With a longitudinal velocity of 3.37 m/s and a distance of 8.28 m, the TTC is approximately 2.46s. The lateral distance remains 0.00m indicating lane alignment, but not necessarily a collision. Risk level: 3 (Medium Risk).

* **Obstacle 30668:** This obstacle is approaching diagonally from the front-left. Both lateral and longitudinal distances are decreasing across the timesteps, indicating a potential risk. At 0.9 seconds, the longitudinal distance is 14.33m, and the lateral distance is 9.73m.  TTC calculations would require adjusted distances and velocity components which aren't available. However, given the closing motion in both dimensions, this warrants closer observation. Currently assessed as 4 (Low Risk) but requires monitoring.

* **Obstacle 30670:** This obstacle is behind the ego vehicle and slightly moving away. The longitudinal distance fluctuates slightly but remains around -6.11m. The lateral distance is consistently 0.00m.  With longitudinal velocity of -0.18 m/s and the distance is -6.11 m, TTC is approximately 33.94 seconds.  The consistent lateral alignment indicates the obstacle is likely in the same lane behind the ego vehicle. Risk level: 5 (Negligible Risk).

* **Obstacle 30671:** This obstacle is behind the ego vehicle and slightly moving away. The longitudinal distance has been essentially constant around -17.12m. The lateral distance is consistently 0.00m.  With longitudinal velocity of -0.07 m/s and the distance is -17.12 m, TTC is approximately 244 seconds. The consistent lateral alignment indicates the obstacle is likely in the same lane behind the ego vehicle. Risk level: 5 (Negligible Risk).
