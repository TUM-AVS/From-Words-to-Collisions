Let's evaluate each obstacle based on the most recent timestep (0.9 seconds):

### Obstacle Analysis

#### Obstacle 30660:
- **Direction**: Front
- **Adjusted Distances**: Longitudinal: 23.77 m, Lateral: 0.00 m
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal: 3.86 m/s, Lateral: -0.34 m/s
- **Trajectory**: Moving away from the ego vehicle longitudinally, and laterally moving slightly away
- **Motion Description**: Exact lateral alignment indicates alignment in lane, moving away
- **MDC**: Mainly consider longitudinal as lateral is 0.00 m. Movement away implies increasing distance.
- **TTC Calculation**: Since it's moving away, the TTC is not calculated for collision.

**Risk Assessment**: No collision or risk as distances are increasing.
- **Overall Risk Score**: `5`

#### Obstacle 30662:
- **Direction**: Front-left
- **Adjusted Distances**: Longitudinal: 14.83 m, Lateral: 20.94 m
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal: -3.77 m/s, Lateral: -4.21 m/s
- **Trajectory**: Moving toward the ego vehicle, both longitudinally and laterally
- **MDC**: The exact convergence not provided, but with both directions converging, it's notable.
- **TTC Calculation**: 
  - Longitudinal: 14.83 m / 3.77 m/s ≈ 3.93 s
  - Lateral: 20.94 m / 4.21 m/s ≈ 4.97 s 

**Risk Assessment**: The calculated TTC in both directions is greater than 3s but less than 5s.
- **Overall Risk Score**: `4`

#### Obstacle 30663:
- **Direction**: Front
- **Adjusted Distances**: Longitudinal: 8.28 m, Lateral: 0.00 m
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal: 3.37 m/s, Lateral: 0.42 m/s
- **Trajectory**: Moving away from the ego vehicle.
- **Motion Description**: Exact lateral alignment indicates alignment in lane, moving away.
- **MDC**: Since it's moving away from both longitudinal and lateral, increases in distance indicate negligible risk.
- **TTC Calculation**: Not toward the vehicle, movement indicates no collision trajectory.

**Risk Assessment**: SThe obstacle is moving away.
- **Overall Risk Score**: `5`

#### Obstacle 30668:
- **Direction**: Front-left
- **Adjusted Distances**: Longitudinal: 14.33 m, Lateral: 9.73 m
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal: -3.66 m/s, Lateral: -3.42 m/s
- **Trajectory**: Small distances with converging paths indicate notable risk.
- **MDC**: Converging from both directions, computed MDC is low.
- **TTC Calculation**:
  - Longitudinal: 14.33 m / 3.66 m/s ≈ 3.92 s
  - Lateral: 9.73 m / 3.42 m/s ≈ 2.85 s

**Risk Assessment**: The risk assessment, based on calculated MCC and reduce in distances, is notable.
- **Overall Risk Score**: `3`

#### Obstacle 30670:
- **Direction**: Behind
- **Adjusted Distances**: Longitudinal: -6.11 m, Lateral: 0.00 m
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal: -0.18 m/s, Lateral: -0.13 m/s
- **Trajectory**: Rearward motion with a stable distance indicates alignment but not collision risk.
- **MDC**: Exists due to exact alignment, yet unlikely for closer contact.
- **TTC Calculation**: Given rearward moving position, refers to safety.

**Risk Assessment**: The vehicle moving behind implies no collision scenarios relative to motion safety.
- **Overall Risk Score**: `5`

#### Obstacle 30671:
- **Direction**: Behind
- **Adjusted Distances**: Longitudinal: -17.12 m, Lateral: 0.00 m
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal: -0.07 m/s, Lateral: -0.21 m/s
- **Trajectory**: Rearward stable motion reflects safety in dimension indications.
- **MDC**: Non-threatening given negative longitudinal direction, spacing accounted.
- **TTC Calculation**: Not to be calculated for closer intervals.

**Risk Assessment**: Distance maintained to reflect no hazardous danger.
- **Overall Risk Score**: `5`
