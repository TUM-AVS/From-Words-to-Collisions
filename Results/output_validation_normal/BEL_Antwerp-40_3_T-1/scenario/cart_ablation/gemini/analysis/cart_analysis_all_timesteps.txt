Obstacle 30663 is in the same lane as the ego vehicle (lanelet 195) and is rapidly approaching from behind.  At t=0.9s, obstacle 30663 is at (359.2568, 535.9016) while the ego vehicle is at (353.3585, 547.2579). While the y-coordinates suggest some lateral separation, the x-coordinate difference of less than 6 meters, coupled with 30663's higher velocity (6.9362 vs ego's 3.5494) indicates a high probability of an imminent collision if obstacle 30663 does not decelerate substantially or change lanes. This is classified as an extreme risk.

Obstacle 30670 is also in the same lane as the ego vehicle (lanelet 195). At t=0.9s, obstacle 30670 is located at (349.1246, 556.9935) compared to the ego's position of (353.3585, 547.2579).  Although 30670 is ahead of the ego, its x-position is only slightly ahead while it has a higher y-position, and its velocity is rapidly decreasing (3.3678 at t=0.9s from 3.8325 at t=0.4s, with a negative acceleration throughout). This deceleration combined with its position relative to the ego creates an extreme risk of collision.
