At t=0.9s, Ego is in lanelet 195. Let's analyze the obstacles:

* **Obstacle 30663:** This obstacle is in lanelet 1045, which seems to be close to Ego's lanelet 195 based on prior positions. Its velocity (6.9362) is much higher than Ego's (3.5494) and it's moving towards Ego's lane based on previous location at 0.7. This poses a high risk if this obstacle merges into 195 ahead of Ego. However, its current position at 0.9s is still far enough away where a collision is not imminent in the next immediate moment.  Risk score: 2-3.

* **Obstacle 30670:** Located in the same lanelet as Ego (195) and is behind Ego. While its recent acceleration is negative, it still has a velocity of 3.3678 while Ego is at 3.5494. Given the proximity and velocity difference, a collision is possible if Ego decelerates suddenly or Obstacle 30670 accelerates.  Risk score: 2-3.

* **Obstacle 30671:** Also in lanelet 195 and behind Ego, further away than 30670. Its velocity is decreasing, further reducing risk. Risk score: 3-4.

* **Obstacle 30660, 30662, 30668:** These obstacles are in different lanelets (197 and 266) and are positioned laterally away from Ego, posing no immediate threat. Risk Score: 4-5.

Since no obstacle poses an immediate collision risk (score 0 or 1),  IsCollisionScenario is false.

{
  "CollisionObstacles": [],
  "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null,
  "ScenarioAnalysis": {
    "IsCollisionScenario": false,
    "Reasoning": "No obstacles pose an immediate collision risk at t=0.9s. Obstacle 30663 and 30670 have medium risk due to lane change proximity and same-lane velocity difference, but a collision is not imminent in the next moment."
