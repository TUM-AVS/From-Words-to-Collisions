### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep (0.9 seconds):

### Obstacle Analysis:

1. **Obstacle ID: 30660.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Located in lanelet 197.0, moving away from ego (lanelet 195.0). Distance is increasing over time.
   - **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: High velocity (7.4148) but moving away from ego. Relative velocity is positive.
   - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)

2. **Obstacle ID: 30662.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Located in lanelet 266.0, far from ego's lanelet (195.0). No intersection with ego's path.
   - **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: Moderate velocity (4.2159) but no convergence with ego's trajectory.
   - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)

3. **Obstacle ID: 30663.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Initially in same lanelet (195.0) but moved to lanelet 1045.0. Distance is increasing.
   - **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: High velocity (6.9362) but diverging path. Relative velocity is positive.
   - **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low Risk)

4. **Obstacle ID: 30668.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Located in lanelet 266.0, no overlap with ego's lanelet (195.0). Distance is stable.
   - **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: Low velocity (3.4239) and no convergence with ego's path.
   - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)

5. **Obstacle ID: 30670.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: In same lanelet (195.0) but behind ego. Distance is decreasing but still safe.
   - **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: Low velocity (3.3678) and decelerating (-2.5001). Closing speed is manageable.
   - **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low Risk)

6. **Obstacle ID: 30671.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: In same lanelet (195.0) but far behind ego. Distance is stable.
   - **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: Low velocity (3.4825) and decelerating (-1.2558). No immediate threat.
   - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. No obstacles are on a direct collision course with the ego vehicle.
2. Obstacles in the same lanelet (30670.0, 30671.0) are behind the ego and decelerating.
3. Obstacle 30663.0 has moved to a different lanelet and is diverging.
4. All other obstacles are in non-conflicting lanelets or moving away.
5. No immediate or extreme risks detected.
