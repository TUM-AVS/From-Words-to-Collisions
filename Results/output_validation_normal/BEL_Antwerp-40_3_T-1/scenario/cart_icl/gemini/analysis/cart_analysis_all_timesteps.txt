### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
No obstacles have a risk score of 0, so this is not a collision scenario. Obstacle 30663 and 30670 show high risk (score of 2), as they are close, in the same lane, and moving towards the ego vehicle. However, their deceleration in the most recent steps mitigates the immediate risk. Other obstacles are further away and/or exhibit diverging trajectories, posing lower risks.

### Summary in JSON Format:
