Obstacle 30668 is approaching the ego vehicle longitudinally and laterally from the front-left.  At 0.9 seconds, it is 14.33 meters longitudinally and 9.73 meters laterally, closing at speeds of -3.66 m/s and -3.42 m/s respectively. While not immediately colliding, the continuous approach and relatively close proximity warrants attention.

Obstacle 30662, appearing at 0.9 seconds, is also approaching longitudinally and laterally from the front-left. At 14.83 m longitudinally and 20.94 m laterally, its lateral distance is significantly greater than 30668, but its longitudinal approach (-3.77 m/s) and lateral speed (-4.21 m/s) raise some concern. It requires monitoring in the next few timesteps.

    "Reasoning": "No obstacle is currently colliding with the ego vehicle. Obstacles 30668 and 30662 pose the highest risk due to their converging trajectories and proximity, warranting close monitoring. However, at the current timestep, their distances and relative velocities do not indicate an immediate or extremely high risk of collision."
