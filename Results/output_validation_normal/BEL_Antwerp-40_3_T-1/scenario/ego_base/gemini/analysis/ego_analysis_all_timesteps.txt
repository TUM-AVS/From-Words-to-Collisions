Obstacle 30668 is approaching the ego car longitudinally and laterally from the front-left.  It is the closest obstacle at a longitudinal distance of 14.33m and a lateral distance of 9.73m, and its motion suggests a potential collision risk if the current trajectories continue. However, it's not an immediate collision risk.

Obstacle 30662 is also approaching from the front-left and further away than 30668 (longitudinal 14.83m and lateral 20.94m). While the lateral distance is greater, it's still moving towards the ego vehicle, so it bears monitoring but poses less of an immediate threat than 30668.

Obstacle 30670 is behind the ego vehicle and moving slightly away longitudinally (-6.11m and 0.0m lateral). Its longitudinal velocity fluctuates around 0 and its lateral velocity is near zero, representing minimal risk. 

Obstacle 30671 is also behind the ego and moving slightly away. Given its greater distance and similar behavior to 30670, it represents negligible risk.

Obstacles 30660 and 30663 are moving away from the ego vehicle longitudinally and pose no collision risk.
