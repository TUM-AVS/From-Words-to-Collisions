### Safety analysis for timestep 0.9 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

**Assumptions and Clarifications:**

* The prompt mentions "adjusted distances" (adjusted_d_long, adjusted_d_lat).  However, these values were NOT provided in the scenario description.  Therefore, I'm forced to use the provided `real distance` (DTClong, DTClat) values. This reduces the accuracy of the analysis.  For a real-world application, providing adjusted distances is crucial.
* I'm assuming that "Exact lateral alignment or unknown case" means the lateral velocity is close to zero or its behavior is unpredictable.
* I will infer TTC (Time To Collision) qualitatively based on distance, velocity, and acceleration since explicit TTC values are not provided.
* Similarly, MDC (Minimum Distance to Collision) will be assessed based on current distances and motion trends.
* I am assuming that no evasive action will take place and risk is assessed as a pure following of the current motion of the ego vehicle and the obstacles at time step 0.9s.


### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 30660**
- Distance Risk reason: Located front of the ego car, at 23.77m longitudinally and laterally. This implies the obstacle is diagonally ahead and relatively far.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Moving away longitudinally at 3.86 m/s and almost stationary laterally (-0.34 m/s).  No collision risk is apparent.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 30662**
- Distance Risk reason: Approaching from the front-left (14.83m longitudinally and laterally).  Requires monitoring.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Closing in both longitudinally (-3.77 m/s) and laterally (-4.21 m/s). This represents a potential collision risk.
- Time safety score: 2
- Overall Risk score: 3

- **Obstacle ID: 30663**
- Distance Risk reason: In front of the ego car at 8.28m longitudinally and laterally. Relatively close.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: Moving away longitudinally at 3.37 m/s, with a small lateral velocity (0.42 m/s). Risk appears low given the longitudinal movement.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 30668**
- Distance Risk reason:  Approaching from the front-left (14.33m longitudinally and laterally). Requires monitoring.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Closing in both longitudinally (-3.66 m/s) and laterally (-3.42 m/s). This represents a potential collision risk.
- Time safety score: 2
- Overall Risk score: 3

- **Obstacle ID: 30670**
- Distance Risk reason: Behind the ego car at -6.11m longitudinally and laterally. Relatively close.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: Slightly moving away longitudinally (-0.18 m/s) and laterally (-0.13 m/s).  Low risk given the motion direction.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 30671**
- Distance Risk reason: Behind the ego car at -17.12m longitudinally and laterally. Relatively far.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Slightly moving away longitudinally (-0.07 m/s) and laterally (-0.21 m/s). Low risk given the motion direction and distance.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5


### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
    "CollisionObstacle": null,
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null,
    "IsCollisionScenario": false,
    "Justification": "No obstacle has an overall risk score of 0 (collision) or 1 (extreme risk). Obstacles 30662 and 30668 show moderate risk (score 3) due to their approach from the front-left, but this does not constitute an immediate collision scenario given the current distances in this timestep."
