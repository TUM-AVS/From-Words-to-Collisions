* **Obstacle 30660:** This obstacle is in front and moving away longitudinally, but has been approaching laterally from the left over the observed timesteps. At the last timestep, the lateral distance is nearly zero, meaning it's essentially alongside the ego vehicle. Although the lateral velocity is negative, the small distance warrants caution.  Given the longitudinal motion is away from the ego vehicle, the primary concern is lateral.  The lateral velocity is -0.34 m/s, resulting in a relatively high TTC if calculated (TTC ~= 0/0.34), but it may still become a threat. This warrants a Medium Risk (3) due to the proximity and potential for lateral movement shifts. MDC is essentially 0m laterally.

* **Obstacle 30662:**  This obstacle appears in the last timestep in the front-left at a lateral distance of 20.94m and longitudinal distance of 14.83m. With negative relative velocity in both directions, it's approaching the ego vehicle. Even with negative velocity, the lateral and longitudinal distance would result in a risk level above 4, so we will score this as a medium risk (3)

* **Obstacle 30663:** This obstacle is directly in front of the ego vehicle and moving away longitudinally. The lateral distance remains 0.00m throughout, indicating perfect longitudinal alignment, but not necessarily a collision if the longitudinal distance increases and the car moves away. While the longitudinal distance is decreasing slightly in the first few timesteps, it consistently increases in later timesteps.  The risk here is assessed as Medium Risk (3) because of the close proximity and need to monitor for any sudden trajectory changes. MDC is essentially 0m laterally.

* **Obstacle 30668:** This obstacle is approaching from the front-left. Both lateral and longitudinal distances are decreasing across timesteps. At the last timestep, the distances are 9.73m (lateral) and 14.33m (longitudinal) respectively, with negative velocities indicating continued approach. This obstacle warrants a Low risk level (4)

* **Obstacle 30670:** This obstacle is behind the ego vehicle and initially moves away but starts approaching in later timesteps. The lateral distance is consistently 0.00m, indicating perfect longitudinal alignment.  However, the small negative relative velocity and the decreasing longitudinal distance is worth to take a close look at.  This obstacle is assessed as a Medium Risk (3) because the small velocity will make the risk level over 3 according to the distance.

* **Obstacle 30671:** Similar to 30670, but the longitudinal distance is significantly larger.  The obstacle starts very far away and does not appear to pose a threat. No risk (5).

**Collision Scenario Determination:**

No obstacle has a risk score of 0 (collision) or 1 (extreme risk). Therefore, this is NOT a collision scenario.
