### Obstacle-by-Obstacle Analysis

#### Obstacle 30660:
- **Position**: Front of ego vehicle
- **Adjusted Distances**: longitudinal 23.77 m, lateral 0.00 m
- **Relative Velocity**: longitudinal 3.86 m/s away, lateral -0.34 m/s towards
- **Motion Description**: Moving away longitudinally, approaching laterally from left
  - **TTC Longitudinal**: Not applicable (moving away)
  - **TTC Lateral**: Adjusted Distance / |Velocity| = 0.00 m / 0.34 m/s = 0 seconds (critical alignment rapidly)
  - **MDC**: As the car moves toward zero lateral alignment on the same longitudinal line, MDC effectively is approaching zero.
- **Risk Level**: Extreme risk in lateral, as the lateral distance is nearly zero with continued convergence.

#### Obstacle 30663:
- **Position**: Front of ego vehicle
- **Adjusted Distances**: longitudinal 8.28 m, lateral 0.00 m
- **Relative Velocity**: longitudinal 3.37 m/s away, lateral 0.42 m/s towards
- **Motion Description**: Moving away longitudinally, exact lateral alignment.
  - **TTC Longitudinal**: Not applicable (moving away)
  - **MDC**: With 0 lateral distance, the MDC is longitudinal distance = 8.28 m.
- **Risk Level**: No Risk due to diverging trajectories.

#### Obstacle 30668:
- **Position**: Front-left of ego vehicle
- **Adjusted Distances**: longitudinal 14.33 m, lateral 9.73 m
- **Relative Velocity**: longitudinal -3.66 m/s, lateral -3.42 m/s
- **Motion Description**: Driving toward egos longitudinally and laterally.
  - **TTC Longitudinal**: 14.33 m / 3.66 m/s = 3.92 s
  - **TTC Lateral**: 9.73 m / 3.42 m/s = 2.84 s
  - **MDC**: Paths converging implies significance in lower TTC value of lateral: minimum estimated point of scenario showing higher lateral reduction in relative path.
- **Risk Level**: Medium Risk as both longitudinal and lateral relative motions are converging, but the times are manageable.

#### Obstacle 30670:
- **Position**: Behind ego vehicle
- **Adjusted Distances**: longitudinal -6.11 m, lateral 0.00 m
- **Relative Velocity**: longitudinal -0.18 m/s far
- **Motion Description**: Moving away longitudinally.
  - **TTC Longitudinal**: Not applicable because it's moving away.
  - **MDC**: Negative distance behind; motion indicates no convergence.
- **Risk Level**: No Risk as it is moving away.

#### Obstacle 30671:
- **Position**: Behind ego vehicle
- **Adjusted Distances**: longitudinal -17.12 m, lateral 0.00 m
- **Relative Velocity**: longitudinal -0.07 m/s
- **Motion Description**: Moving away longitudinally.
  - **TTC Longitudinal**: Not applicable because it's moving away.
  - **MDC**: Negative distance and moving away from ego car.
- **Risk Level**: No Risk as it is moving away.

### Conclusion
Obstacle 30660 is approaching a critical alignment with a risk level indicating Extreme Risk due to nearly zero lateral distance in conjunction with aligned lateral velocity. Movement continues to converge to zero effectively assessing high potential for collision if unmitigated due to very short temporal overlap.

#### Collision Scenario Determination: YES
