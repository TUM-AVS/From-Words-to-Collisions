Here's the analysis and the JSON output:

**Analysis:**

Obstacle 30660: This obstacle starts relatively far from the ego vehicle and in a different lanelet (266 vs. 197).  While its y-coordinate is somewhat close to the ego vehicle's, its x-coordinate suggests a longitudinal separation.  It also appears to be moving away from the ego vehicle as time progresses. The change in lanelet to 1101 also indicates divergence.  Therefore, it does not represent a high collision risk.

Obstacle 30661: This obstacle also begins in a different lanelet (1047 and then 1103) than the ego vehicle.  Its y-coordinate places it significantly below the ego vehicle's path. While its x-coordinate suggests it is somewhat ahead of the ego vehicle and their velocities are similar, their paths don't seem to intersect given the lanelet information and constant y-coordinate difference. Hence, the risk of collision is low.

Obstacle 30662: This obstacle, like obstacle 30660, is in lanelet 266. Initially, its y-coordinate is farther from the ego vehicle than 30660.  However, over the time steps its x position decreases.  Still, the lane difference and the relatively constant y-separation suggest a low risk of collision.
