Obstacle 30660 initially poses a potential risk due to its proximity to the ego vehicle and differing orientation, suggesting a possible crossing trajectory.  However, its trajectory seems to be diverging from the ego vehicle's path over the subsequent timesteps.

Obstacle 30661 maintains a roughly parallel trajectory to the ego vehicle, but its lateral distance appears to be safe throughout the provided timeframe. Its fluctuating acceleration might require monitoring.

Obstacle 30662's behavior is more concerning. While initially somewhat distant, its erratic acceleration and deceleration suggest unpredictable movement.  Combined with its differing orientation, this makes its future trajectory uncertain and potentially risky.  It's important to note the significant negative acceleration at 0.8 seconds which makes future prediction challenging based on current data.

None of the obstacles are on a direct collision course or exhibiting behavior that definitively indicates an immediate collision within the observed time window. Continued observation and prediction are necessary, particularly for Obstacle 30662, to determine if the risk level escalates.
