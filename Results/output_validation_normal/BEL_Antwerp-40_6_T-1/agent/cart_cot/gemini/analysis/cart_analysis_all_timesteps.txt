At t=0.9s, the ego vehicle is at (370.2926, 513.5796) with a velocity of 6.8499 and heading -1.1358 radians.  Let's analyze each obstacle:

**Obstacle 30660:** Located at (367.619, 533.206) with velocity 5.5356 and heading -2.6462 radians. This obstacle is moving towards the ego vehicle's path, but the y-coordinate difference suggests a safe lateral distance.  Additionally, the difference in orientations implies diverging paths, reducing collision risk. However, given the relatively short distance and closing velocities, this warrants further monitoring.

**Obstacle 30661:** Located at (376.6154, 500.1007) with a velocity of 7.2233 and a heading of -1.1286 radians.  This obstacle is ahead of the ego vehicle and slightly to the right, and traveling in roughly the same direction. Though the y-coordinates suggest some lateral separation, the relatively small difference in x-coordinate, along with similar velocities and orientations, raises some concern.

**Obstacle 30662:** Located at (377.9463, 537.6128) with velocity 3.0193 and heading -2.7581 radians. This obstacle is further away laterally from the ego vehicle than obstacle 30660 and is moving more slowly. The diverging orientations also significantly reduce the collision risk.

Considering the latest positions, velocities, and orientations at t=0.9s:

* **No immediate collision is predicted.**  While obstacles 30660 and 30661 present some risk, further analysis suggests they are unlikely to collide with the ego vehicle in the very next timestep.

* **Obstacle 30661 poses the most significant risk** due to its proximity in the x-direction, similar velocity, and nearly parallel path to the ego vehicle. Obstacle 30660 also requires attention because of its converging trajectory, though the lateral separation and differing orientations suggest a lower risk than 30661.
