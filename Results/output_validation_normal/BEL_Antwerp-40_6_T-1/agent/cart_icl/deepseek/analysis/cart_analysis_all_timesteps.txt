### Analysis:

1. **Obstacle 30660 (ID: 30660)**:
   - **Position**: (367.619, 533.206) at 0.9s
   - **Orientation**: -2.6462 (radians)
   - **Velocity**: 5.5356 m/s
   - **Acceleration**: 1.2164 m/s²
   - **Relative Motion**: Moving towards the ego vehicle from the front-left side.
   - **TTC**: The distance between ego and obstacle is decreasing, but the lateral separation is significant (~13.6m at 0.9s). TTC is not immediate.
   - **Risk**: **Low (4)** due to sufficient lateral distance.

2. **Obstacle 30661 (ID: 30661)**:
   - **Position**: (376.6154, 500.1007) at 0.9s
   - **Orientation**: -1.1286 (radians)
   - **Velocity**: 7.2233 m/s
   - **Acceleration**: 0.0915 m/s²
   - **Relative Motion**: Moving in a similar direction as the ego vehicle but with a significant lateral separation (~13.5m at 0.9s).
   - **TTC**: The longitudinal distance is increasing, and lateral separation is large.
   - **Risk**: **Negligible (5)**.

3. **Obstacle 30662 (ID: 30662)**:
   - **Position**: (377.9463, 537.6128) at 0.9s
   - **Orientation**: -2.7581 (radians)
   - **Velocity**: 3.0193 m/s
   - **Acceleration**: -5.9456 m/s²
   - **Relative Motion**: Moving away from the ego vehicle with a significant lateral separation (~24.0m at 0.9s).
   - **TTC**: The distance is increasing.
   - **Risk**: **Negligible (5)**.

### Summary:
- No obstacles pose an immediate collision or extreme risk to the ego vehicle.
- All obstacles have sufficient lateral and longitudinal separation, with no significant risk of collision.
