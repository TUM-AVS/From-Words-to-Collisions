At t=0.9s, the ego vehicle is at (370.29, 513.58) with a velocity of 6.85 m/s.  Let's analyze each obstacle:

* **Obstacle 30660:** Located at (367.62, 533.21).  This obstacle is behind the ego vehicle and moving into lane 1101 which diverges from the ego vehicle's path.  While the Y coordinate suggests potential lateral proximity, the divergent paths and the obstacle's location behind the ego mitigate the risk. Risk: **Low (4)**

* **Obstacle 30661:** Located at (376.62, 500.10). This obstacle is ahead of the ego vehicle but significantly to the right (lower Y coordinate). It's moving into lane 1103 also expected to be diverging. There is no immediate risk of collision given the lateral separation. Risk: **Negligible (5)**

* **Obstacle 30662:** Located at (377.95, 537.61).  Ahead and to the left of the ego vehicle, this obstacleâ€™s position and lanelet 266 suggests it is not intersecting ego's direct path. Though position data alone puts it relatively near the ego, it is far ahead. There is minimal risk of collision due to lanelet separation. Risk: **Low (4)**

No obstacles present an immediate collision risk.
