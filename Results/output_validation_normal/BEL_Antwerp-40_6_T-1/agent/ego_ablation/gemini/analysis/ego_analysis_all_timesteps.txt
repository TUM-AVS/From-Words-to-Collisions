At t=0.9s, Obstacle 30660 is moving away longitudinally but towards the ego laterally.  It's the closest obstacle laterally (4.24m) and although the lateral speed is somewhat high (-5.53 m/s), the longitudinal motion and current distance suggest a medium risk. Obstacle 30661 poses negligible risk, moving away longitudinally at 10.38m with a slow relative velocity.  Obstacle 30662 is far away longitudinally (-14.06m) and laterally (15.46m) while moving away and thus presents negligible risk.  There are no collisions or extreme/high risk obstacles in this scenario.
