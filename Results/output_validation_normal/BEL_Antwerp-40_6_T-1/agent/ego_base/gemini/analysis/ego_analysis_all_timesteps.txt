At t=0.9s:
- Obstacle 30660: Rear-left, moving away longitudinally, moving closer laterally. Distance: 14.42m longitudinal, 4.24m lateral.  While moving closer laterally, the lateral distance is still relatively safe and the longitudinal motion is away from the ego vehicle.  Medium risk (3).
- Obstacle 30661: Front, moving away longitudinally at a slow speed, almost directly in front of the ego vehicle. Distance: 10.38m longitudinal, 0.00m lateral.  While directly ahead, it is moving away and at a safe distance. Low risk (4).
- Obstacle 30662: Rear-left, moving away longitudinally, but moving closer laterally.  Distance: 14.06m longitudinal, 15.46m lateral.  Given the distances and relative velocities/accelerations, this obstacle poses a low risk (4).
