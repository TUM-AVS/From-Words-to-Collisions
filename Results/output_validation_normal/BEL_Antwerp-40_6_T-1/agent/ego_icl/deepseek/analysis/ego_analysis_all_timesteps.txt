Let me analyze each obstacle at the most recent timestep (0.9 seconds):

**Obstacle 30660 (Rear-left):**
- Position: longitudinal -14.42m, lateral 4.24m
- Relative velocity: longitudinal -6.52 m/s (moving away), lateral -5.53 m/s (approaching)
- Motion: Moving away longitudinally but approaching laterally from left
- Analysis:
  - Longitudinal: Safe (moving away at 6.52 m/s)
  - Lateral: Closing at 5.53 m/s from 4.24m
  - TTC (lateral): 4.24/5.53 = 0.77 seconds (High Risk)
  - MDC: Current lateral distance is 4.24m (Low Risk)
  - Overall: High Risk (2) due to TTC < 1.0s

**Obstacle 30661 (Front):**
- Position: longitudinal 10.38m, lateral 0.00m
- Relative velocity: longitudinal 0.37 m/s (moving away), lateral 0.05 m/s
- Motion: Moving away longitudinally, exact lateral alignment
- Analysis:
  - Longitudinal: Moving away at 0.37 m/s from 10.38m (No Risk)
  - Lateral: 0.00m alignment but no closing velocity (No Risk)
  - TTC: N/A (diverging paths)
  - MDC: >5m (No Risk)
  - Overall: No Risk (5)

**Obstacle 30662 (Rear-left):**
- Position: longitudinal -14.06m, lateral 15.46m
- Relative velocity: longitudinal -7.01 m/s (moving away), lateral -3.02 m/s (approaching)
- Motion: Moving away longitudinally but approaching laterally from left
- Analysis:
  - Longitudinal: Safe (moving away at 7.01 m/s)
  - Lateral: Closing at 3.02 m/s from 15.46m
  - TTC (lateral): 15.46/3.02 = 5.12 seconds (No Risk)
  - MDC: >5m (No Risk)
  - Overall: No Risk (5)

Trajectory Analysis:
- Obstacle 30660 shows consistent lateral closing velocity (~5 m/s) with decreasing lateral distance
- Obstacle 30661 maintains safe longitudinal distance with minimal relative velocity
- Obstacle 30662 has large lateral distance despite approaching velocity
