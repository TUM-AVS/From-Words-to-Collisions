### Obstacle Analysis

#### Obstacle 30660:
- **Position and Trajectory**: Rear-left, moving away longitudinally while driving toward laterally.
- **Adjusted Distance**: Longitudinal -14.42 m, Lateral 4.24 m.
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal -6.52 m/s, Lateral -5.53 m/s.
- **Trajectory Analysis**:
  - **Longitudinal**: Distance increasing, indicating it's moving further away.
  - **Lateral**: Distance decreasing at a high rate (-5.53 m/s), suggesting a lateral closing.
- **TTC Calculation**:
  - Longitudinal TTC = Not applicable (moving away).
  - Lateral TTC = 4.24 m / 5.53 m/s ≈ 0.77 seconds.
- **MDC Analysis**:
  - Primarily lateral component considered due to lateral movement toward the ego vehicle.
  - MDC in lateral ≈ 4.24 m.
- **Risk Assessment**: High Risk due to significant lateral closing velocity resulting in a low lateral TTC and decreasing lateral distance.

#### Obstacle 30661:
- **Position and Trajectory**: Front of ego vehicle, exact lateral alignment.
- **Adjusted Distance**: Longitudinal 10.38 m, Lateral 0.00 m.
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal 0.37 m/s, Lateral 0.05 m/s.
- **Trajectory Analysis**:
  - **Longitudinal**: Distance stable/increasing at a very low rate.
  - **Lateral**: Exact lateral alignment, not closing laterally.
- **TTC Calculation**:
  - Longitudinal TTC = 10.38 m / 0.37 m/s ≈ 28.05 seconds.
  - Lateral component irrelevant due to alignment.
- **MDC Analysis**:
  - MDC > 5.0 m as the obstacle is moving away longitudinally.
- **Risk Assessment**: Negligible Risk due to very high longitudinal TTC and no imminent collision possibility.

#### Obstacle 30662:
- **Position and Trajectory**: Rear-left, moving away longitudinally while driving toward laterally.
- **Adjusted Distance**: Longitudinal -14.06 m, Lateral 15.46 m.
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal -7.01 m/s, Lateral -3.02 m/s.
- **Trajectory Analysis**:
  - **Longitudinal**: Distance increasing as it moves further away.
  - **Lateral**: Distance decreasing at -3.02 m/s, but far from the ego vehicle initially.
- **TTC Calculation**:
  - Longitudinal TTC = Not applicable (moving away).
  - Lateral TTC = 15.46 m / 3.02 m/s ≈ 5.12 seconds.
- **MDC Analysis**:
  - Primarily lateral distance, MDC would be around 15.46 m.
- **Risk Assessment**: Low Risk based on ample lateral TTC, although scenario needs monitoring due to trajectory toward the ego vehicle.

**Overall Summary**: Obstacle 30660 presents the highest risk level (2 - High Risk) mainly due to its lateral trajectory toward the ego vehicle with a decreasing lateral distance and a low TTC. Obstacle 30661 has a negligible risk due to its stable trajectory and large longitudinal distance. Obstacle 30662 has a low risk due to sufficient distance and TTC, although it requires observation.
