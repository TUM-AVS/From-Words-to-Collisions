At t=0.9s, Ego is at (370.29, 513.58) in lanelet 197.

Obstacle 30660 is at (367.62, 533.21) in lanelet 1101.  While the y-coordinate (533.21) suggests some distance, the x-coordinate (367.62) is very close to Ego's (370.29) and obstacle 30660's x coordinate has been generally decreasing, showing a potential trajectory conflict. This obstacle's lanelet changes indicate it's likely maneuvering, increasing uncertainty and potential risk.  Considering the proximity and trajectory, this warrants further analysis. However, given the information provided, the risk cannot definitively be classified as "Extreme".  It's closer to a "High Risk (2)" situation.


Obstacle 30661 is at (376.62, 500.10) in lanelet 1103.  The y-coordinate difference is substantial.  The x-coordinate, while ahead of the ego vehicle, is not concerning given the current velocities and short timeframe.  This is likely "Low Risk (4)" or "Negligible Risk (5)".

Obstacle 30662 is at (377.95, 537.61) in lanelet 266. While the y-coordinate suggests some distance, the x-coordinate (377.95) is close to Ego's (370.29) and this obstacle has shown erratic velocity changes, including significant deceleration in the last step. This warrants attention but currently does not present an extreme risk. This is likely a "Medium Risk (3)" given the uncertainty introduced by the fluctuating acceleration.
