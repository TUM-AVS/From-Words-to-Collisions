At t=0.9s, Ego is at (370.29, 513.58) in lanelet 197.

Obstacle 30660 is at (367.62, 533.21) in lanelet 1101.  While the y-coordinate difference isn't huge, the x-coordinate suggests this obstacle is moving away from the Ego vehicle.  The change in lanelets over the past few timesteps also supports that this obstacle is moving away and not towards the Ego vehicle.  Therefore, not a collision risk.

Obstacle 30661 is at (376.62, 500.10) in lanelet 1103. This obstacle is also spatially separated and trajectory analysis from prior time steps doesn't indicate an immediate collision risk.

Obstacle 30662 is at (377.95, 537.61) in lanelet 266.  Again, spatially separated and no indication of immediate collision risk.
