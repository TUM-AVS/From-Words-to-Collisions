### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep (0.9 seconds):

### Obstacle Analysis:

1. **Obstacle ID: 30660.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is moving towards the ego vehicle (Y-coordinate decreasing from 534.827 to 533.206 over 0.9s). Current distance is ~19.6m (sqrt((367.619-370.2926)^2 + (533.206-513.5796)^2)). The obstacle is in a different lanelet (1101.0 vs ego's 197.0), but trajectory shows convergence.
   - **Distance safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: Relative velocity is ~1.31m/s (ego: 6.85m/s, obstacle: 5.54m/s). TTC ~15s (distance/relative velocity). Acceleration trends show obstacle is decelerating slightly.
   - **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 3 (Medium Risk)

2. **Obstacle ID: 30661.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is moving parallel to the ego vehicle (similar orientation -1.1286 vs -1.1357). Current distance is ~12.5m. Both are moving in same direction with similar speeds.
   - **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: Relative velocity is ~0.37m/s (ego: 6.85m/s, obstacle: 7.22m/s). TTC ~34s. Acceleration trends show minor fluctuations.
   - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low Risk)

3. **Obstacle ID: 30662.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is moving away from the ego vehicle (Y-coordinate decreasing slowly from 538.696 to 537.6128). Current distance is ~24.1m. Different lanelet (266.0) and opposite trajectory.
   - **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: Relative velocity is ~3.83m/s (ego: 6.85m/s, obstacle: 3.02m/s). TTC ~6.3s but increasing as obstacle is decelerating rapidly (-5.95m/sÂ²).
   - **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low Risk)

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. No obstacles are in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle (197.0).
2. Obstacle 30660.0 shows the highest risk due to converging trajectory, but current distance and TTC indicate manageable risk.
3. All other obstacles are either moving parallel or away from the ego vehicle with safe distances.
4. No immediate collision risk detected in the current timestep or projected trajectory.
