### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
No obstacles are on a direct collision course with the ego vehicle.  All obstacles are either in different lanelets or exhibit diverging trajectories based on their positions, velocities, and accelerations over the observed time steps. Thus, it's not a collision scenario.
