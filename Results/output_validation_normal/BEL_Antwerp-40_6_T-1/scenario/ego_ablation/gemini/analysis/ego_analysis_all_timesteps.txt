Obstacle 30660 is moving away longitudinally but towards the ego car laterally.  At the last timestep (0.9 seconds), the lateral distance is only 4.24 meters and decreasing at a rate of -5.53 m/s. While not an immediate collision, the rapid lateral approach represents a significant risk.

Obstacle 30661 is moving away longitudinally and presents minimal lateral movement (possibly due to noise/inaccuracy). It does not represent a collision risk.

Obstacle 30662 is moving away longitudinally and slightly towards the ego car laterally. While the lateral speed is negative, the lateral distance is substantial (15.46m) and increasing, suggesting a low risk.
