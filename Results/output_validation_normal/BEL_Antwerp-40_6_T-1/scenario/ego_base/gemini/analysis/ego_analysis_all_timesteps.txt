At t=0.9s:
- **Obstacle 30660:** Located rear-left, moving away longitudinally and towards the ego car laterally.  The lateral distance is decreasing but still at 4.24m. This obstacle does not pose an immediate collision risk.
- **Obstacle 30661:** Located in front, moving away longitudinally and almost perfectly aligned laterally (0.00m). While the longitudinal distance is increasing, the near-perfect lateral alignment and relatively slow relative longitudinal velocity (0.37 m/s) require attention.  However, it is not an immediate collision risk.
- **Obstacle 30662:** Located rear-left, moving away longitudinally and towards the ego car laterally. Similar to Obstacle 30660, the lateral distance is decreasing (15.46 m) but not posing an immediate threat. It is worth monitoring due to the persistent lateral movement towards the ego vehicle.

Given that no obstacle poses an immediate collision risk in the last time step, the scenario is not considered a collision scenario.
