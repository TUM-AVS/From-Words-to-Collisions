### Safety analysis for timestep 0.9 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

It's important to note that while the provided data gives relative longitudinal and lateral distances and velocities, it *doesn't* give us enough information to accurately compute TTC (Time to Collision) or MDC (Minimum Distance to Collision) without knowing the ego vehicle's dimensions and the precise nature of the obstacles' predicted paths. The lateral movement of the obstacles towards the ego vehicle while the longitudinal distance increases suggests potential path intersection, but we can't determine if a collision is truly imminent based on this limited data.  Therefore, I'll make qualitative assessments based on the provided information.

### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID:** 30660
- **Distance Risk reason:**  Located rear-left and moving away longitudinally (-14.42m) but moving closer laterally (-14.42m). This lateral movement poses the primary concern. Since we don't have vehicle dimensions, we can't determine precisely how close it is, but the decreasing lateral distance merits attention.
- **Distance safety score:** 4 (Low Risk - for now. This could rapidly change to a higher risk depending on the lateral movement).
- **Time Risk reason:**  We lack the information to calculate TTC accurately. The obstacle is moving away longitudinally but towards the ego vehicle laterally.  We need more data to assess if these paths will intersect dangerously.
- **Time safety score:** 3 (Medium Risk - due to the uncertainty and the lateral movement towards the ego vehicle)
- **Overall Risk score:** 4 (Low Risk leaning towards Medium. Requires careful monitoring).


- **Obstacle ID:** 30661
- **Distance Risk reason:** Located in front and moving further away longitudinally (10.38m) and the lateral motion seems minimal or parallel to the ego vehicle (10.38m).  
- **Distance safety score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)
- **Time Risk reason:** Obstacle is moving further away longitudinally and lateral movement is minimal. No immediate time-related risk.
- **Time safety score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)
- **Overall Risk score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)


- **Obstacle ID:** 30662
- **Distance Risk reason:** Located rear-left and moving away longitudinally (-14.06m) but approaching laterally (-14.06m), similar to obstacle 30660. The lateral movement requires attention.
- **Distance safety score:** 4 (Low Risk - currently, but lateral motion warrants monitoring)
- **Time Risk reason:**  Similar to 30660, insufficient data to calculate TTC accurately. The converging lateral movement raises the risk level.
- **Time safety score:** 3 (Medium Risk due to lateral convergence).
- **Overall Risk score:** 4 (Low Risk leaning towards Medium risk due to lateral convergence).



### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
  "CollisionObstacle": null,
  "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null,
  "IsCollisionScenario": false,
  "Justification": "No immediate collisions detected, but obstacles 30660 and 30662 are approaching laterally while moving away longitudinally, requiring further monitoring. The provided data isn't sufficient to accurately determine TTC or MDC and therefore definitively rule out future collision possibilities."
