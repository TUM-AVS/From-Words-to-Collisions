### Analysis:

1. **Ego Vehicle Motion**:
   - The ego vehicle is decelerating (negative acceleration) consistently over the observed timesteps, with velocity decreasing from 9.2068 m/s to 7.3755 m/s.
   - The orientation is slightly negative (clockwise rotation), indicating a slight leftward drift, but the overall path remains in lanelet 347.0.

2. **Obstacle (ID: 30699) Motion**:
   - The obstacle is moving at a much slower velocity (~1.48 m/s) with minor fluctuations in acceleration.
   - The obstacle is in lanelet 1158.0, which suggests it is not in the same lane as the ego vehicle.
   - The obstacle's orientation (~1.1 radians) indicates it is moving at an angle relative to the ego vehicle.

3. **Relative Motion and Risk Assessment**:
   - The lateral distance between the ego and the obstacle is significant (the obstacle is at ~430.7 Y-coordinate, while the ego is at ~427.3 Y-coordinate, giving a lateral separation of ~3.4m).
   - The longitudinal distance is decreasing, but the obstacle is far ahead (~14.4m at 0.9s) and not in the same lane.
   - The TTC is not critical because the lateral separation ensures no immediate collision risk.
   - The MDC (minimum distance to collision) remains large due to the lateral separation.

4. **Risk Score**:
   - The obstacle poses **Negligible Risk (5)** because the lateral separation and non-intersecting paths ensure no collision risk.
