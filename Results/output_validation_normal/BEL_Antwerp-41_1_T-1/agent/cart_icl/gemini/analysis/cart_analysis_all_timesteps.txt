At t=0.9s, the ego vehicle at (-79.57, 427.35) is moving with a velocity of 7.38 m/s and decelerating at -0.39 m/s².  Obstacle 30699 is at (-65.17, 430.79) with a velocity of 1.48 m/s and decelerating slightly at -0.22 m/s².

The lateral distance between the ego and the obstacle is approximately 3.44 meters.  The longitudinal distance is approximately 14.4 meters. The relative longitudinal velocity is 7.38 - 1.48 = 5.9 m/s (ego is faster).  A simple TTC calculation (14.4 / 5.9 ≈ 2.44s) suggests some time to react. However, the different lane assignments (347 for ego and 1158 for the obstacle) and the orientations indicate these vehicles are likely on intersecting paths.  The obstacle's slow speed and the ego's deceleration suggest the ego vehicle *might* be approaching a junction and slowing down.

Without more context (e.g., lanelet map information, vehicle dimensions), it's difficult to precisely determine the risk.  The lateral distance and different lane markings suggest a low risk, yet if the lane merging/intersection geometry involves crossing the obstacle's path without yielding, it presents a greater hazard.  A conservative estimate, given the uncertainty, places this interaction in the medium-risk category as the ego vehicle has time to react by braking harder or adjusting its trajectory slightly, assuming lane-following behavior.
