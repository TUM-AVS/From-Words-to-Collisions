At t=0.9s, obstacle 30699 is located at a longitudinal distance of 9.66m and a lateral distance of 2.67m from the ego vehicle, in the front-left zone.  The obstacle is moving towards the ego vehicle longitudinally with a relative velocity of -6.86 m/s and moving away laterally with a relative velocity of 1.39 m/s. While the longitudinal distance is decreasing, the lateral distance is increasing, suggesting the obstacle might be moving on a diverging path. However, the longitudinal velocity is still concerning. Given the current rate of closing and assuming constant velocity (a simplification), a collision could occur in approximately 1.4 seconds. This warrants a high-risk assessment.
