At t=0.9s, obstacle 30699 is located 9.66m longitudinally and 2.67m laterally from the ego vehicle, in the front-left zone. The relative longitudinal velocity is -6.86 m/s, indicating the obstacle is approaching the ego vehicle.  The lateral velocity is 1.39 m/s, meaning it's moving away to the left. While the longitudinal distance is decreasing, the lateral movement suggests the obstacle might be diverging. However, the distance is still relatively close, warranting close monitoring and potentially placing it in a medium to high-risk category. More context like ego vehicle's intended trajectory and speed is needed for a definitive risk assessment.
