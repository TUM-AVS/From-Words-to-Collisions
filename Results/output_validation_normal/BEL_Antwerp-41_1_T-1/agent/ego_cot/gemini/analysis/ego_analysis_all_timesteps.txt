### Safety analysis for timestep 0.9s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:
- **Obstacle ID:** 30699
- **Distance Risk reason:** At 0.9 seconds, Obstacle 30699 is 9.66m longitudinally and 9.66m laterally away from the ego vehicle, located in the front-left.  While the distance is not extremely close, the continuous approach of the obstacle longitudinally (decreasing distance over multiple timesteps) warrants attention. The lateral movement away from the ego vehicle slightly mitigates the risk.
- **Distance safety score:** 3 (Medium Risk)
- **Time Risk reason:**  We don't have explicit TTC calculations, but based on the closing longitudinal velocity (-6.86 m/s) and the decreasing longitudinal distance over the past timesteps, a collision is possible if the current trend continues. The lateral velocity (1.39 m/s) suggests the obstacle is moving away laterally, which reduces the immediate risk.  Without explicit TTC values, precise risk assessment is difficult.
- **Time safety score:** 3 (Medium Risk)
- **Overall Risk score:** 3 (Medium Risk)
