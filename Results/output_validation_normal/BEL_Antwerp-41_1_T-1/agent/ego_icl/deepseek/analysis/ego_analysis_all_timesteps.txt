### Obstacle Analysis

#### Obstacle 30699 (Front-left of ego car)
- **Most Recent Timestep (0.9s):**
  - **Adjusted Longitudinal Distance:** 9.66 m (closing at -6.86 m/s)
  - **Adjusted Lateral Distance:** 2.67 m (increasing at 1.39 m/s)
  - **Relative Velocity:** 
    - Longitudinal: -6.86 m/s (approaching)
    - Lateral: 1.39 m/s (moving away)
  - **Motion Description:** Obstacle is driving toward the ego car longitudinally but moving away laterally to the left.

#### Trajectory Analysis
- The obstacle is consistently moving toward the ego car longitudinally (distance decreasing from 15.85 m to 9.66 m over 0.9s).
- The lateral distance is increasing (from 1.28 m to 2.67 m), indicating the obstacle is moving away from the ego car laterally.

#### Time-to-Collision (TTC)
- **Longitudinal TTC:** 
  - Distance = 9.66 m, Relative Velocity = 6.86 m/s (absolute value since it's closing).
  - TTC = 9.66 / 6.86 ≈ 1.41 seconds.
  - Risk Level: Medium (1.0 < TTC ≤ 3.0 seconds).
- **Lateral TTC:** 
  - Not applicable since the obstacle is moving away (lateral distance increasing).

#### Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC)
- The obstacle is moving away laterally, so the MDC is primarily determined by the longitudinal distance.
  - MDC = 9.66 m.
  - Risk Level: No Risk (MDC > 5.0 m).

#### Overall Risk Assessment
- The obstacle poses a **Medium Risk (3)** due to the longitudinal TTC (1.41 seconds).
- The lateral movement away from the ego car reduces the risk of collision.
