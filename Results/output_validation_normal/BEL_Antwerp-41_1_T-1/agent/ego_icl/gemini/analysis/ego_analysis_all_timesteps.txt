Obstacle 30699:

Trajectory Analysis: Over the past 0.9 seconds, obstacle 30699 has been moving closer to the ego vehicle longitudinally while moving further away laterally. The longitudinal distance has decreased from 15.85m to 9.66m, while the lateral distance has increased from 1.28m to 2.67m.

TTC Calculation:
Longitudinal TTC = 9.66m / 6.86 m/s = 1.41 seconds

Lateral TTC is not applicable as the obstacle is moving away laterally.

MDC Calculation:  Given the obstacle's trajectory (moving closer longitudinally but further laterally), the minimum distance to collision will occur in the future.  We can estimate it by continuing the trajectory trends. It's difficult to precisely calculate MDC without more future data, but based on the current trend, the MDC seems likely to be greater than the current lateral distance of 2.67m.

Risk Assessment:

* Longitudinal Risk:  The longitudinal TTC of 1.41 seconds suggests a Medium Risk (3).

* Lateral Risk: The increasing lateral distance suggests a Negligible Risk (5).


Overall Risk: Considering both longitudinal and lateral movements, the overall risk is Medium (3). The obstacle is approaching longitudinally at a moderate speed, but the lateral movement is creating a larger separation, mitigating the collision risk.
