### Obstacle-by-Obstacle Analysis

#### Obstacle 30699

**Trajectory Analysis Across Timesteps:**
- Over the 0.1-second intervals, the obstacle's longitudinal distance from the ego vehicle is decreasing each timestep, indicating that it is moving towards the ego.
- The obstacle's lateral distance, however, is increasing, suggesting it is moving away to the left relative to the ego vehicle. This lateral movement is confirmed by positive lateral velocities.

**Current Position (Most Recent Timestep at 0.9 seconds):**
- Adjusted longitudinal distance: 9.66m
- Adjusted lateral distance: 2.67m
- Relative longitudinal velocity: -6.86 m/s (approaching)
- Relative lateral velocity: 1.39 m/s (moving away)
  
**Risk Assessment:**
- **TTC Calculation:**
  - Longitudinal TTC = 9.66 m / 6.86 m/s â‰ˆ 1.41 seconds (approaching)
  - Lateral movement is not contributing to the collision as the obstacle moves away, so no lateral TTC is necessary.

- **MDC Calculation:**
  - Longitudinal MDC is impacted by the linear closure but is confirmed upwards as the vehicle does not have lateral alignment closure.
  - Lateral MDC is non-threatening due to increasing lateral distance.

- **Risk Scoring:**
  - Longitudinal TTC suggests a medium risk as it falls between 1.0 and 3.0 seconds.
  - Due to the obstacle moving laterally away, any potential risk is mitigated.

**Conclusion:**
- There is a Medium Risk associated with Obstacle 30699 based on the longitudinal TTC calculation while no imminent lateral risk supports maintaining risk score of 3 under these potentially diverging trajectories.
