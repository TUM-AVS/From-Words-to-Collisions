At t=0.9s, Ego is at (-79.57, 427.35) and the obstacle is at (-65.17, 430.79). The distance between them is approximately 15.5 meters.  While the obstacle is in a different lanelet, the ego vehicle's x-position is rapidly approaching the obstacle's x-position, and given the ego vehicle's deceleration and the small difference in y-position, a future collision within the next few seconds seems highly probable.  The different orientations suggest they are not travelling parallel, increasing collision risk. Therefore, this poses an extreme risk.
