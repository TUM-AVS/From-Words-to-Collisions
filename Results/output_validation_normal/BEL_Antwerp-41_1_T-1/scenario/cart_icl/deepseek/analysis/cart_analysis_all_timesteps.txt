### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep:  
Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:
- **Obstacle ID**: 30699.0  
  - **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is in a different lanelet (1158.0) than the ego vehicle (347.0). Over the past timesteps, the lateral distance between them has remained large (~20-25 units), and the obstacle is moving away from the ego's path.  
  - **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)  
  - **Time Risk reason**: The obstacle's velocity (~1.48 m/s) is much slower than the ego's (~7.38 m/s), and the relative distance is increasing. The acceleration trends show no convergence.  
  - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)  
  - **Overall Risk score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)  

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:  
1. **Lanelet Check**: Ego is in lanelet 347.0, obstacle is in lanelet 1158.0 (no overlap).  
2. **Trajectory Analysis**: Obstacle is moving slowly (~1.48 m/s) with minor acceleration fluctuations, while ego is decelerating but still moving faster (~7.38 m/s).  
3. **Distance Trend**: Lateral distance is stable (~20-25 units), and longitudinal distance is increasing (ego is moving away).  
4. **Collision Risk**: No intersection or convergence in trajectories.
