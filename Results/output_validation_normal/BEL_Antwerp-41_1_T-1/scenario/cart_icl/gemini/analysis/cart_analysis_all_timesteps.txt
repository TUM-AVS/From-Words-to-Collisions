### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 30698.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is far from ego and moving away laterally.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason:  No time-based risk due to lateral movement and distance.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 30699.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is somewhat close laterally, but poses minimal risk given current trajectories.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason:  Low relative velocity and no immediate threat based on past movement.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- Obstacle ID: 30700.0
- Distance Risk reason: Similar lateral position as 30698.0, but farther longitudinally, thus no risk.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Low relative velocity and no imminent threat.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 30703.0
- Distance Risk reason: Far from ego and not on a collision course.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: No immediate risk due to distance and trajectories.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 30704.0
- Distance Risk reason:  Far from ego and not on a collision course.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: No time-based risk due to distance and trajectories.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 30705.0
- Distance Risk reason: Far from ego and located in a different lanelet.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: No immediate time-based risk due to different lanelet and large distance.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
No obstacle presents an immediate collision risk. All obstacles are either far from the ego vehicle or moving in directions that do not pose a threat over the analyzed timeframe.  This is not a collision scenario.
