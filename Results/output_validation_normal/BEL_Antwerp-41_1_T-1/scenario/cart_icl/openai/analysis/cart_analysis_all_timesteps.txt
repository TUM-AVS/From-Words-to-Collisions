### Obstacle Analysis:

#### Obstacle: 30698.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle remains in a different lanelet with increasing distance from the ego vehicle's trajectory. Consistent slight acceleration and a mostly stable position indicates it's moving away.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: The low velocity and minimal acceleration over previous timesteps suggest a negligible risk of collision with the ego vehicle.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

#### Obstacle: 30699.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is located in a different lanelet with a relatively stable lateral position and consistent velocity changes. It's not approaching the ego vehicle's path significantly.
- **Distance safety score**: 4
- **Time Risk reason**: Slow and relatively constant velocity, aligning parallel to the ego path but not into it, reduces collision probability.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 4

#### Obstacle: 30700.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: Positioned aside and moving at a low speed parallel to the ego vehicle. Consistent trajectory without alignment into the ego path.
- **Distance safety score**: 4
- **Time Risk reason**: Low and mostly constant velocity, along with minimal acceleration, suggest low collision probability over time.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 4

#### Obstacle: 30703.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is in a separate pathway without convergence into the ego's trajectory. Its gradual directional change indicates it keeps moving parallel.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: Minor acceleration changes and stable velocity not threatening the ego vehicle path.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

#### Obstacle: 30704.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: Positioned significantly away from the ego vehicle with stable, non-converging motion and limited acceleration.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: Consistent speed and orientation changes are parallel, not toward the ego vehicle.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

#### Obstacle: 30705.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: This obstacle shows consistent motion in a different lanelet. Its higher velocity but lateral difference implies minimal risk of direct collision.
- **Distance safety score**: 4
- **Time Risk reason**: Although the velocity is higher, due to its maintained parallel trajectory, time to collision remains comfortably high.
- **Time safety score**: 4
- **Overall Risk score**: 4

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
The scenario at the most recent timestep shows no trajectories crossing the ego vehicle's current and projected path. All obstacles have a safe parallel course to the ego, with no evidence from past timesteps showing intention via acceleration or velocity to converge into the ego's path.
