Obstacle 30699 is moving towards the ego vehicle longitudinally while moving away laterally.  At the last timestep (0.9 seconds), the longitudinal distance is decreasing, but still relatively safe at 9.66 meters with a closing velocity of -6.86 m/s. The lateral distance is increasing, suggesting the obstacle is diverging. Although the longitudinal velocity is negative (approaching), the distance and relative lateral motion suggest the risk is not extreme.  However, the decreasing longitudinal distance warrants attention, placing it potentially in the medium to high-risk category, depending on the size and expected behavior of the obstacle. More data points beyond 0.9 seconds would be needed to confidently assess the risk level.
