At t=0.9s, obstacle 30699 is located 9.66m longitudinally and 2.67m laterally in the front-left of the ego vehicle.  It is approaching the ego vehicle longitudinally with a relative velocity of -6.86 m/s and moving away laterally at 1.39 m/s. Although the lateral movement suggests some divergence, the longitudinal distance is decreasing rapidly. While a collision isn't imminent in the next timestep, the continuous approach longitudinally and relatively high closing speed suggest a high risk of collision in the near future if the current trajectories are maintained.
