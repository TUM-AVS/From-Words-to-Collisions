### Safety analysis for timestep 0.9 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 30699
- Distance Risk reason: At 0.9 seconds, Obstacle 30699 is 9.66m longitudinally and 9.66m laterally away from the ego vehicle, located in the front-left. While the lateral distance suggests a low risk, the continuously decreasing longitudinal distance indicates a potential collision risk if the current relative velocity persists.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: The obstacle is moving towards the ego vehicle longitudinally with a speed of -6.86 m/s. Although there is lateral movement away from the ego vehicle (1.39 m/s), the dominant longitudinal motion poses a significant concern.  Without knowing the exact dimensions of the vehicles, a precise TTC calculation isn't possible, but the provided information suggests a medium to high risk due to the closing longitudinal distance. However, the positive relative longitudinal acceleration (0.30 m/sÂ²) indicates that the closing speed is decreasing, slightly reducing the risk.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3


### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
  "CollisionObstacle": null,
  "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null,
  "IsCollisionScenario": false,
  "Justification": "No obstacle is currently in a collision state (Overall Risk Score 0) or an extreme risk state (Overall Risk Score 1). Although Obstacle 30699 is approaching the ego vehicle longitudinally,  the lateral movement and the slightly positive longitudinal acceleration suggest that a collision is not imminent in the next few moments, making the overall scenario not yet classified as a collision scenario."
