### Obstacle-by-Obstacle Analysis

#### Obstacle 30699 (Most Recent Timestep: 0.9 seconds)
- **Direction**: Front-left of ego car
- **Adjusted Distances**: 
  - Longitudinal: 9.66 m (closing at -6.86 m/s)
  - Lateral: 2.67 m (increasing at 1.39 m/s)
- **Motion Description**: 
  - Obstacle is driving toward the ego car longitudinally.
  - Obstacle is moving away laterally to the left.

#### Trajectory Analysis (Across Timesteps)
1. **Longitudinal Distance**: 
   - Decreasing from 15.85 m to 9.66 m over 0.9 seconds.
   - Closing velocity is high (~7 m/s) but decreasing slightly due to positive relative acceleration (0.30 m/s² at 0.9s).
2. **Lateral Distance**: 
   - Increasing from 1.28 m to 2.67 m over 0.9 seconds.
   - Obstacle is moving away laterally at ~1.35 m/s consistently.

#### TTC Calculation
- **Longitudinal TTC**: 
  - Distance = 9.66 m, Relative Velocity = 6.86 m/s (absolute value since closing).
  - TTC = 9.66 / 6.86 ≈ 1.41 seconds (Medium Risk, TTC between 1.0-3.0s).
- **Lateral TTC**: 
  - Not applicable (lateral distance is increasing, so no collision risk in this dimension).

#### MDC Calculation
- The obstacle is diagonally positioned (front-left), so MDC is the smaller of the two distances when projected paths intersect.
- Since the lateral distance is increasing, the paths are diverging laterally. Thus, MDC is effectively the current lateral distance (2.67 m), which is Low Risk (MDC between 3.0-5.0m).

#### Risk Assessment
- **Longitudinal Risk**: Medium (TTC = 1.41s).
- **Lateral Risk**: No Risk (diverging paths).
- **Overall Risk**: Medium Risk (3) – Prioritize the higher risk (longitudinal).

### Collision Scenario Determination
- No obstacle has a risk score of 0 (collision) or 1 (extreme risk).
- The closest risk is Medium (3) for Obstacle 30699 due to longitudinal closing, but the lateral divergence ensures no imminent collision.
