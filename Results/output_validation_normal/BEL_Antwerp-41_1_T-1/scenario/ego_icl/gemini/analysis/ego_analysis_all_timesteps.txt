Obstacle 30699 Analysis:

Trajectory Analysis: Over the past 0.9 seconds, Obstacle 30699 has been moving closer to the ego vehicle longitudinally while moving further away laterally.  The longitudinal distance has decreased from 15.85m to 9.66m, while the lateral distance has increased from 1.28m to 2.67m. This indicates a diagonal trajectory where the obstacle is approaching from the front-left but also diverging to the left.

TTC Calculation (at t=0.9s):
* Longitudinal TTC = 9.66m / 6.86 m/s ≈ 1.41 seconds
* Lateral TTC =  2.67m / 1.39 m/s ≈ 1.92 seconds (not directly applicable for collision risk since it's diverging)

MDC Calculation (at t=0.9s):
Given the diagonal trajectory, the MDC will be the longitudinal distance at the point where the lateral paths would theoretically intersect.  Since the obstacle is moving away laterally, a simple Euclidean distance is suitable as the MDC for assessment. The MDC is greater than 2.67m (since it is diagonal, we can make this quick conclusion without the unnecessary trigonometric calculation).

Risk Assessment (at t=0.9s):
* Longitudinal Risk: Medium Risk (3) due to TTC of 1.41s
* Lateral Risk: No Risk (5) - distance is increasing
* Overall Risk: Medium Risk (3) - dominated by the longitudinal approach. Although the lateral motion is diverging, the longitudinal approach is the primary concern.


Collision Scenario Determination:

No obstacle has a risk score of 0 (Collision) or 1 (Extreme Risk). Therefore, this is NOT a collision scenario.
