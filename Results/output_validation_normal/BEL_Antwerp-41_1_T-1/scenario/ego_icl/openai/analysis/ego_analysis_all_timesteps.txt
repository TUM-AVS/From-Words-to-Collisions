### Obstacle Analysis

#### Obstacle 30699 Trajectory Analysis:
- **Timestep Overview:**
  - Obstacle 30699 is moving from a position of 15.85 m longitudinally and 1.28 m laterally to 9.66 m longitudinally and 2.67 m laterally between 0.1 and 0.9 seconds.
  - The obstacle is approaching the ego vehicle longitudinally and moving away laterally.
  
#### Most Recent Timestep Analysis (0.9 seconds):
- **Adjusted Distances** (use hypothetical values if not provided):
  - **Adjusted Longitudinal Distance:** 9.66 m
  - **Adjusted Lateral Distance:** 2.67 m
  
- **Relative Velocities:**
  - **Longitudinal:** -6.86 m/s (approaching)
  - **Lateral:** 1.39 m/s (moving away)

#### Time-to-Collision (TTC) Calculation:
- **Longitudinal TTC:** 
  - TTC = 9.66 m / |6.86 m/s| = 1.41 seconds

- **Lateral TTC:**
  - Since the obstacle is moving away laterally and the relative lateral velocity is positive (moving apart), TTC is not applicable for collision in lateral.

#### Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC) Calculation:
- **Longitudinal MDC:**
  - Approaching at current velocity implies reducing distance. However, given trajectory diverges in lateral direction, calculate MDC primarily longitudinal.
  - Prediction shows decreasing longitudinal distance, but no final intersection in lateral suggests MDC larger than 1.0 m.

- **Lateral MDC:**
  - Since lateral separation is increasing, move towards longitudinal component for MDC consideration.

#### Risk Assessment:
- **Longitudinal TTC:** 1.41 seconds falls in the Medium Risk category (3).
- **Lateral Path Divergence:** Results in no severe reduction in lateral distance.
- **MDC:** Combination of increasing lateral distance and relative motion suggests an MDC > 1.0m projected.

- **Overall Risk Score for Obstacle 30699:** 3 (Medium Risk)

### Conclusion
- **Collision Scenario:** The situation is not considered a collision scenario. TTC and MDC don't indicate an imminent collision (no risk score 0 or 1).
