Obstacle 30615 is in the same lane as the ego vehicle and initially quite far behind. However, over the time steps, the distance between the ego vehicle and obstacle 30615 is decreasing, indicating a potential risk.  While the fluctuating acceleration of 30615 makes it harder to predict precisely, the overall trend suggests a need to monitor this obstacle closely.

Obstacle 30618 starts in a different lane but moves into the ego vehicle's lane around timestamp 0.4 seconds. Its velocity is consistently higher than the ego vehicle's and it is accelerating, while the ego vehicle is decelerating. This creates a high-risk scenario of a potential rear-end collision.  The decreasing distance combined with these differing speed profiles makes this the most significant immediate risk.
