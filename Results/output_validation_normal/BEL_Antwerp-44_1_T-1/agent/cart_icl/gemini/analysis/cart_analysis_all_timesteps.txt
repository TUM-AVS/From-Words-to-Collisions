At t=0.9s, the ego vehicle is at (484.4433, 216.2206) with a velocity of 7.8227 m/s.  Let's analyze the two obstacles:

**Obstacle 30615:** Located at (489.1206, 234.4289) with a velocity of 5.7428 m/s. This obstacle is ahead of the ego vehicle and to its left.  The lateral distance is substantial, and while the longitudinal distance is decreasing, the relative velocity suggests a low risk of collision in the immediate future.  Further monitoring is needed, but the current situation does not present an immediate threat.

**Obstacle 30618:** Located at (478.0081, 192.3115) with a velocity of 7.7141 m/s. This obstacle is behind the ego vehicle and to its right. The lateral distance is significant, and although it's in a different lanelet, it appears to be merging into the ego vehicle's lane. The difference in orientation suggests a non-zero relative velocity, but a precise TTC calculation requires more information about the lane geometry. The current situation presents a medium risk due to the merging behavior and warrants close monitoring.

Approximate TTC and MDC calculations (assuming straight-line trajectories, which may not be accurate):

**Obstacle 30615:**
* Longitudinal distance: 489.1206 - 484.4433 = 4.6773 m
* Lateral distance: 234.4289 - 216.2206 = 18.2083 m
* Longitudinal relative velocity: 5.7428 - 7.8227 = -2.0799 m/s (obstacle is slower)
* Approximate TTC: 4.6773 / 2.0799 ≈ 2.25 s

**Obstacle 30618:**
* Longitudinal distance: 484.4433 - 478.0081 = 6.4352 m
* Lateral distance: 216.2206 - 192.3115 = 23.9091 m
* Longitudinal relative velocity: 7.8227 - 7.7141 = 0.1086 m/s (ego is slightly faster)
* Approximate TTC: 6.4352 / 0.1086 ≈ 59.26 s
