### Analysis:

1. **Ego Vehicle (30617.0)**:
   - **Position Evolution**: Progresses steadily from (482.6665, 209.3104) to (484.4433, 216.2206).
   - **Orientation**: Consistent orientation around 1.3191 radians.
   - **Velocity**: Decreases slightly from 7.984 m/s to 7.8227 m/s.
   - **Acceleration**: Minor negative acceleration indicating slight deceleration.

2. **Obstacle 30615.0**:
   - **Position Evolution**: Moves from (487.9779, 229.981) to (489.1206, 234.4289).
   - **Orientation**: Nearly constant, similar to the ego vehicle.
   - **Velocity**: Minor fluctuations, around 5.74 m/s throughout.
   - **Acceleration**: Minor oscillations, indicating stability.
   - **Relative Motion**: Despite proximity, velocity and orientation are similar to Ego, maintaining a safe distance.
   - **TTC & MDC**: No immediate reduction in relative distance or velocity that favors collision.

3. **Obstacle 30618.0**:
   - **Position Evolution**: Changes significantly from (476.7677, 188.8795) to (478.0081, 192.3115).
   - **Orientation**: Increases from 1.0788 to 1.2382 radians indicating lateral shift.
   - **Velocity**: Increases significantly from 6.0997 m/s to 7.7141 m/s, with substantial positive acceleration.
   - **Acceleration**: Remains positive throughout, indicating a strong acceleration primarily increasing velocity.
   - **Relative Motion**: Though positioned in the same lanelet as of later timesteps, current trajectory suggests movement in a different tangent, posing no direct collision threat.
   - **TTC & MDC**: It has a higher lateral offset with Ego, which continues to grow, alleviating collision concerns.

### Risk Analysis:
- **Obstacle 30615.0**: Despite being located in the same lanelet and closer proximity, it maintains enough relative distance and similar velocity with the ego to minimize any collision risk.
- **Obstacle 30618.0**: Acceleration and lateral trajectory significantly differ; while catching up, ample lateral separation precludes imminent collision likelihood.

### Summary:
- **No Collision Risk immediately apparent** for either obstacle based on detailed analysis of positions, velocity, trajectory, and acceleration relative to ego.
