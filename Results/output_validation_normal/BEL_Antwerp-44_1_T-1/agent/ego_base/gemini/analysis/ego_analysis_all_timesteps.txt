At t=0.9s, Obstacle 30615 is in front of the ego vehicle, approaching at -2.08 m/s with a longitudinal distance of 14.29m. This represents a medium risk (3) as there is still time and distance to react, though monitoring is necessary.  Obstacle 30618 is behind the ego vehicle, moving away at -0.13 m/s with a longitudinal distance of -20.25m. This poses a negligible risk (5) due to the increasing distance and slow relative velocity.
