### Safety analysis for timestep 0.9s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

**- Obstacle ID: 30615**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 30615 is in front of the ego vehicle at a lateral distance of 14.29m and a longitudinal distance of 14.29m. Although the distance is significant, the obstacle is moving towards the ego vehicle longitudinally with a negative relative velocity.  Since the lateral distance is equal to the longitudinal distance, and it's directly in the ego vehicle's path as it moves forward, a potential collision can happen if the ego vehicle maintains its current trajectory and the obstacle continues driving toward it.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason:  The continuous negative longitudinal relative velocity (-2.08 m/s) and the decreasing longitudinal distance indicate that the time to collision is not immediate but should be monitored.  Without lateral movement, the primary concern is the closing longitudinal distance.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

**- Obstacle ID: 30618**
- Distance Risk reason:  Obstacle 30618 is behind the ego vehicle with a significant longitudinal distance (-20.25m) and lateral distance (-20.25m). The negative values indicate the obstacle is behind and to the side of the ego car.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: This obstacle is moving away from the ego vehicle longitudinally (negative relative velocity of -0.13 m/s and increasing longitudinal distance), posing no immediate threat.  Lateral movement is not a concern given the direction and distance.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5
