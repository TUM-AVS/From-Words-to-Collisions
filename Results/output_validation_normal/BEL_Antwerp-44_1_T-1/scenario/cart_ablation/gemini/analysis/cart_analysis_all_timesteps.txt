At t=0.9s, Ego (30617.0) is in lanelet 298.0 at (484.4433, 216.2206).

Obstacle 30615.0 is also in lanelet 298.0 at (489.1206, 234.4289).  While it's further ahead longitudinally, the lateral distance is relatively small and warrants attention. Given the past trajectory, this obstacle seems to have erratic acceleration, but currently, it doesn't pose an immediate collision risk.

Obstacle 30618.0 is also in lanelet 298.0 at (478.0081, 192.3115). This places it behind and to the side of the Ego vehicle. While relatively close, the trajectories and velocities do not indicate an immediate collision risk.

No obstacle poses an extreme or collision risk at this timestep.
