At t=0.9s, Ego (30617.0) is in lanelet 298.0 at (484.4433, 216.2206).

Obstacle 30615.0 is also in lanelet 298.0 at (489.1206, 234.4289).  While the y-distance is significant, the x-distance is only about 4.7 meters. Given the speeds and relatively straight trajectories, this obstacle may pose a risk in the near future if the ego continues decelerating and obstacle 30615 maintains speed or accelerates. However, at this moment, there's no immediate danger of collision.

Obstacle 30618.0 is now also in lanelet 298.0 at (478.0081, 192.3115). This obstacle is further behind the ego than 30615.0 and presents less of a risk.

Therefore, no obstacle presents an extreme or collision risk at t=0.9s.
