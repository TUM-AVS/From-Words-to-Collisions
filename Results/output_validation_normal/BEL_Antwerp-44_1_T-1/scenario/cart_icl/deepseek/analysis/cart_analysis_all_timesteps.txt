### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep:

### Obstacle Analysis:

#### Obstacle ID: 30615.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is in the same lanelet (298.0) as the ego vehicle. Over the last 9 timesteps, the obstacle has been moving away from the ego vehicle (increasing Y-coordinate distance). Current distance is ~18.2m (longitudinal).
- **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
- **Time Risk reason**: The obstacle's velocity (5.7428 m/s) is lower than the ego's (7.8227 m/s), and the relative velocity is decreasing (ego is decelerating slightly). TTC is large (~18.2m / (7.8227 - 5.7428) ≈ 8.75s).
- **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
- **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low Risk)

#### Obstacle ID: 30618.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle has entered the same lanelet (298.0) at t=0.4s and is approaching the ego vehicle from behind (Y-coordinate decreasing). Current distance is ~23.9m (longitudinal).
- **Distance safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk)
- **Time Risk reason**: The obstacle's velocity (7.7141 m/s) is slightly lower than the ego's (7.8227 m/s), but it is accelerating (2.2848 m/s²). TTC is large (~23.9m / (7.8227 - 7.7141) ≈ 220s), but the trend shows closing gap.
- **Time safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk)
- **Overall Risk score**: 3 (Medium Risk)

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. Both obstacles are in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle at the most recent timestep.
2. Obstacle 30615.0 is moving away with a safe distance and TTC.
3. Obstacle 30618.0 is approaching from behind but still at a safe distance and TTC, though its acceleration trend warrants monitoring.
4. No immediate collision risk exists at the current timestep.
