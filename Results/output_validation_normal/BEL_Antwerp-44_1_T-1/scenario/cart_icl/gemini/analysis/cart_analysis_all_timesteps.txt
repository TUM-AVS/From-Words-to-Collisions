### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 30615.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is in the same lanelet as ego and getting closer.
- Distance safety score: 2
- Time Risk reason:  Relative velocities indicate potential for collision in near future.
- Time safety score: 2
- Overall Risk score: 2

- Obstacle ID: 30616.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is in a different lanelet and relatively far.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Lateral movement away from ego reduces risk.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- Obstacle ID: 30618.0
- Distance Risk reason: Although behind, obstacle is rapidly approaching ego within the same lanelet. 
- Distance safety score: 2
- Time Risk reason:  High relative velocity and acceleration indicate high risk potential.
- Time safety score: 2
- Overall Risk score: 2

- Obstacle ID: 30619.0
- Distance Risk reason: Stationary and not in ego's path.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason:  Poses no immediate threat.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5


### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
No immediate collision is detected at the most recent timestep. However, obstacles 30615.0 and 30618.0 present high risk due to their proximity and relative velocities in the ego vehicle's lanelet. This requires close monitoring and potential evasive maneuvers. While not an immediate collision scenario, it has a high probability of becoming one if no action is taken.


### Summary in JSON Format:
