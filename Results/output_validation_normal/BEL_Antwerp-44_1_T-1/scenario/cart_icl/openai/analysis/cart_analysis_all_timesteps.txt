### Obstacle Analysis:

**Obstacle 30615.0:**
- **Distance Risk reason:** This obstacle is in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle and is closing distance over time. Given its closer proximity, the distance risk is moderately high.
- **Distance safety score:** 2
- **Time Risk reason:** The obstacle's velocity shows minor fluctuations but remains lower than the ego vehicle, suggesting a potential collision course due to insufficient deceleration.
- **Time safety score:** 2
- **Overall Risk score:** 2

**Obstacle 30616.0:**
- **Distance Risk reason:** Located in a different lanelet, maintaining a consistent distance from the ego vehicle with no observable intersection trajectory.
- **Distance safety score:** 5
- **Time Risk reason:** The obstacle maintains a stable trajectory and speed, posing no immediate threat.
- **Time safety score:** 5
- **Overall Risk score:** 5

**Obstacle 30618.0:**
- **Distance Risk reason:** Initially in a different lanelet, but appears to change trajectory towards the ego lanelet. The distance to the ego vehicle is decreasing over time.
- **Distance safety score:** 3
- **Time Risk reason:** The obstacle has a consistent pattern of increasing speed, indicating possible convergence with the ego's path.
- **Time safety score:** 3
- **Overall Risk score:** 3

**Obstacle 30619.0:**
- **Distance Risk reason:** This obstacle remains stationary and poses no lateral or longitudinal risk to the ego vehicle.
- **Distance safety score:** 5
- **Time Risk reason:** With zero velocity and lack of movement, there's no immediate collision threat.
- **Time safety score:** 5
- **Overall Risk score:** 5

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. Identify potential collision risks based on lanelet locations and proximity changes.
2. Assess longitudinal and lateral movements of each obstacle.
3. Evaluate time-to-collision based on velocity trends relative to the ego.
4. Calculate scores by considering potential collision paths and reactiveness of the ego vehicle.

The scenario does not depict a collision event but suggests potential risks due mainly to obstacles 30615.0 and 30618.0, with changing proximities and velocities warranting attention for further actions.
