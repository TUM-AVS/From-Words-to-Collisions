Obstacle 30615 is approaching the ego vehicle head-on with a decreasing longitudinal distance over each time step.  While the lateral distance is zero, indicating perfect alignment, the relative longitudinal velocity is negative, meaning the obstacle is moving towards the ego vehicle. At the latest timestep (0.9 seconds), the obstacle is 14.29 meters away and approaching at -2.08 m/s. This represents a potential collision risk if the relative velocity does not decrease soon. Obstacle 30618 is moving away from the ego and does not present a collision risk.

  "ScenarioAnalysis": {
    "IsCollisionScenario": false,
    "Reasoning": "Obstacle 30615 is on a collision course with the ego vehicle, exhibiting an extreme risk. While not an immediate collision, the consistent closing velocity and exact lateral alignment suggest a high probability of impact if no evasive action is taken. Obstacle 30618 is moving away and poses no risk."
