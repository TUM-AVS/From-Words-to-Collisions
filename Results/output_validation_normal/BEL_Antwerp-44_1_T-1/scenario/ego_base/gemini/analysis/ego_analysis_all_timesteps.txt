At t=0.9s, obstacle 30615 is in front of the ego vehicle, at a longitudinal distance of 14.29m and approaching at -2.08 m/s. While it's closing in, it's not an immediate collision risk. Obstacle 30618 is behind the ego car, moving away at -0.13 m/s longitudinally and -0.62 m/s laterally, posing no risk.  Neither obstacle presents an immediate collision risk in the next timestep.

**Risk Levels and Definitions:**
<Collision (Score: 0)>: Actual collision has occurred or is unavoidable within the next timestep.
<Extreme Risk (Score: 1)>: Immediate collision or very high likelihood of impact. Urgent action is required.
<High Risk (Score: 2)>: Close to collision or highly probable collision path. Needs prompt attention and quick manoeuvring.
<Medium Risk (Score: 3)>: Moderate collision risk but manageable with timely reactions and proper strategies.
<Low Risk (Score: 4)>: Minimal collision risk. The situation is controllable with sufficient time to react.
<Negligible Risk (Score: 5)>: No significant collision risk. Obstacles are either moving away or far enough not to interfere.
