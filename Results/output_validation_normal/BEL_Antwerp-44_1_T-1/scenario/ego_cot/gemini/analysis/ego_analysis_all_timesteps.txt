### Safety analysis for timestep 0.9 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

**Assumptions and Clarifications:**

* **Missing Adjusted Distances:** The prompt emphasizes using *adjusted* distances (`adjusted_d_long`, `adjusted_d_lat`), but these values are not provided in the scenario context.  Therefore, the analysis will use the raw `DTClong` and `DTClat` values, acknowledging that the results might not be perfectly accurate without the adjustments.
* **TTC Calculation:** TTC will be calculated as `TTC = Distance / Relative Velocity`.  If the relative velocity is zero or moving away, TTC is considered infinite (no collision risk).
* **Lateral TTC:**  The provided data suggests the obstacles are either directly in front/behind or the lateral movement is not precisely known ("Exact lateral alignment or unknown case"). Due to this, the lateral TTC is more of a theoretical measure based on current velocities, which don't seem to fully reflect the situation.
* **MDC:** As no obstacle dimensions are given, MDC is approximated as the minimum distance seen within the provided timeframe.


### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 30615**
    - Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is in front and approaching longitudinally (DTClong decreasing). DTClat is also decreasing, meaning a possible lateral movement towards the ego vehicle's path might be occurring, even if data shows 0 lateral velocity. The distance of 14.29m is relatively close.
    - Distance safety score: 3 (Medium Risk)
    - Time Risk reason: Negative longitudinal relative velocity indicates approaching the ego vehicle. TTClong is approximately 14.29m / 2.08m/s = 6.87 seconds. Although there seems to be some fluctuation in relative acceleration, the general trend is closing.
    - Time safety score: 3 (Medium Risk)
    - Overall Risk score: 3 (Medium Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 30618**
    - Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is behind and moving away (DTClong increasingly negative). Lateral distance is also increasing.
    - Distance safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
    - Time Risk reason: The obstacle is moving away longitudinally. TTC is effectively infinite.
    - Time safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
    - Overall Risk score: 5 (Negligible Risk)

```json
{
    "CollisionObstacle": null,
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null,
    "IsCollisionScenario": false,
    "Justification": "No obstacles pose an immediate collision risk. Obstacle 30615 requires monitoring due to decreasing longitudinal distance and medium-risk TTC, but it's not yet an extreme risk."
