### Obstacle-by-Obstacle Analysis

#### Obstacle 30615 (Front of ego car)
- **Most Recent Timestep (0.9s)**:
  - Longitudinal distance: 14.29 m (adjusted)
  - Lateral distance: 0.00 m (adjusted)
  - Relative velocity: longitudinal -2.08 m/s (approaching), lateral 0.00 m/s (no lateral movement)
  - Motion: Driving toward the ego car longitudinally, exact lateral alignment.

- **Trajectory Analysis**:
  - Longitudinal distance decreases from 16.04 m (0.1s) to 14.29 m (0.9s), indicating consistent approach.
  - Lateral distance remains 0.00 m, indicating perfect alignment.
  - Relative velocity is stable (~-2.1 m/s), with minor fluctuations in acceleration.

- **TTC Calculation**:
  - Longitudinal TTC = 14.29 m / 2.08 m/s ≈ 6.87 s (No Risk, TTC > 5.0 s)
  - Lateral TTC: N/A (no lateral movement).

- **MDC Calculation**:
  - Since the obstacle is directly in front (lateral = 0.00 m), MDC is effectively the longitudinal distance (14.29 m).
  - MDC > 5.0 m (No Risk).

- **Overall Risk**:
  - TTC and MDC both indicate No Risk (5).
  - No collision or extreme risk.

#### Obstacle 30618 (Behind ego car)
- **Most Recent Timestep (0.9s)**:
  - Longitudinal distance: -20.25 m (adjusted, behind ego)
  - Lateral distance: 0.00 m (adjusted)
  - Relative velocity: longitudinal -0.13 m/s (very slow approach), lateral -0.62 m/s (moving away laterally)
  - Motion: Moving away longitudinally, exact lateral alignment.

- **Trajectory Analysis**:
  - Longitudinal distance increases slightly (from -19.44 m at 0.1s to -20.25 m at 0.9s), indicating the obstacle is moving away.
  - Lateral distance remains 0.00 m, but lateral velocity is negative (-0.62 m/s), meaning the obstacle is moving away laterally.
  - Relative longitudinal velocity is very small (-0.13 m/s), and acceleration is positive (0.77 m/s²), suggesting the obstacle is decelerating its approach.

- **TTC Calculation**:
  - Longitudinal TTC: Not applicable (relative velocity is negative, meaning moving away).
  - Lateral TTC: Not applicable (moving away laterally).

- **MDC Calculation**:
  - Since the obstacle is behind and moving away, MDC is effectively the longitudinal distance (20.25 m).
  - MDC > 5.0 m (No Risk).

- **Overall Risk**:
  - TTC and MDC both indicate No Risk (5).
  - No collision or extreme risk.

### Collision Scenario Determination
- Neither obstacle has a risk score of 0 (collision) or 1 (extreme risk).
- Both obstacles are at No Risk (5) due to large distances and diverging or stable trajectories.
