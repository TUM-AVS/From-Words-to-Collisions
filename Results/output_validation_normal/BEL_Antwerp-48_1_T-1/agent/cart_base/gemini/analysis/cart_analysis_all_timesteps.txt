Obstacle 30524 is in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle and initially poses a risk.  Let's analyze the distances over time:

* **0.1s:** Obstacle 30524 is at (116.3779, 380.617) and Ego is at (134.8006, 375.7655).  Distance is approximately 18.6.
* **0.2s:** Obstacle 30524 is at (117.0531, 380.3951) and Ego is at (135.5728, 375.5929). Distance is approximately 18.7.
* **0.3s:**  Distance is approximately 18.8.
* **0.4s:** Distance is approximately 19.0.
* ...
* **0.9s:** Distance is approximately 20.2.

The distance between the ego vehicle and obstacle 30524 is increasing over time.  While they are in the same lane, the obstacle is behind the ego vehicle, and the ego vehicle is decelerating more rapidly.  This implies that the risk is decreasing.

Obstacles 30519 and 30521 are in different lanelets and significantly further away. They do not represent an immediate collision risk.

Given this, there are no collision or extreme risk obstacles. Obstacle 30524 might be considered a medium risk (score 3) initially, but the risk rapidly diminishes as the ego vehicle pulls away. Since the prompt requires identification of specific risk levels (0, 1, and 2), and Obstacle 30524 does not qualify for any of these based on the provided context, it will not be included in the JSON output.
