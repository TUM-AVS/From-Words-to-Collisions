At t=0.9s, the ego vehicle (ID 30523) is at (139.5993, 374.7035) with a velocity of 3.9842 and decelerating at -1.48.  Let's analyze the risk posed by each obstacle at this timestep:

* **Obstacle 30519:** Position (148.9314, 361.3463), velocity 6.0758, acceleration -0.9206. This obstacle is quite far from the ego vehicle, both laterally and longitudinally.  Given the current trajectories, there is no immediate risk.

* **Obstacle 30521:** Position (155.3273, 388.9699), velocity 5.7448, acceleration 0.6316.  This obstacle is also relatively far from the ego vehicle and poses no immediate threat.

* **Obstacle 30524:** Position (121.8221, 378.9066), velocity 7.1355, acceleration -0.1801. This obstacle is in the same lane as the ego vehicle (lanelet 561) and is behind the ego vehicle. The x-coordinate difference (MDC longitudinal) is approximately |139.5993 - 121.8221| = 17.7772 units. While obstacle 30524 is traveling faster than the ego vehicle, both are decelerating and MDC longitudinal is quite large. The y-coordinate difference (MDC lateral) is very small, approximately |374.7035 - 378.9066| = 4.2031 units. MDC lateral is small, but less concerning than a small longitudinal difference since both are decelerating. Both lateral and longitudinal TTC is large since MDC lateral and MDC longitudinal is large.  This obstacle should be monitored, but poses no imminent danger. It might require attention in the upcoming seconds, depending on the evolution of their respective speeds.


Based on the provided data and the analysis above, at time t = 0.9s, none of the obstacles pose an immediate collision risk to the ego vehicle. The closest obstacle is 30524, which is in the same lane and approaching from behind and should be monitored. However, its current distance and the deceleration rates of both vehicles suggest a low probability of a collision in the very near future, based on current conditions.
