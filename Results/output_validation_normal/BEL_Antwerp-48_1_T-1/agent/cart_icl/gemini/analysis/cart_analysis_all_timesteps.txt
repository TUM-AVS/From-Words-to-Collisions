At t=0.9s, the ego vehicle (ID 30523) is at (139.5993, 374.7035) with a velocity of 3.9842 m/s and decelerating at -1.48 m/s². Let's analyze the risk posed by each obstacle:

* **Obstacle 30519:** Located at (148.9314, 361.3463), this obstacle is in a different lanelet and poses no immediate threat.  The lateral distance is significant, and the longitudinal distance suggests no likely collision in the near future.

* **Obstacle 30521:**  At (155.3273, 388.9699), this obstacle is also in a different lanelet and relatively far from the ego vehicle, presenting no immediate risk.

* **Obstacle 30524:** This obstacle, at (121.8221, 378.9066), is in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle (561). The obstacle is behind the ego vehicle and traveling faster. Thus there could be risk of collision if the ego vehicle brakes.

Let's perform some quick estimations. Assuming constant velocity for both vehicles, we can determine their x-coordinates at future time points.  The ego vehicle's x-position in t seconds from now is 139.6 + 3.98t, while the obstacle will be at roughly 121.8 + 7.14t. Setting these equal gives t ≈ 3.8s, after which their x-coordinates would coincide, suggesting overtaking and then a possible collision. However, we expect the ego vehicle to have a negative acceleration, so this time is likely overestimated. Let us estimate the distance between the two vehicles. At t = 0.9, we have the ego vehicle at y = 374.7 and the obstacle at y = 378.9, giving a y distance of roughly 4.2m.  A more complete analysis would involve accounting for acceleration, but given the current information, we would deem this a medium risk.
