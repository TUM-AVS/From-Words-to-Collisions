To analyze potential collisions, we'll begin by evaluating each obstacle's trajectory and relative motion compared to the ego vehicle in the most recent timestep (at 0.9 seconds).

**Ego Vehicle (at 0.9 seconds):**
- Position: (139.5993, 374.7035)
- Orientation: -0.2146
- Velocity: 3.9842 m/s
- Acceleration: -1.48
- Lanelet: 561.0

**Obstacle Analysis:**

1. **Obstacle 30519.0 (at 0.9 seconds):**
   - Position: (148.9314, 361.3463)
   - Orientation: -1.7523
   - Velocity: 6.0758 m/s
   - Acceleration: -0.9206
   - Lanelet: 169.0
   - Analysis: This obstacle is on a different lanelet and the lateral distance is significant, thus posing minimal risk.

2. **Obstacle 30521.0 (at 0.9 seconds):**
   - Position: (155.3273, 388.9699)
   - Orientation: -1.8638
   - Velocity: 5.7448 m/s
   - Acceleration: 0.6316
   - Lanelet: 167.0
   - Analysis: This obstacle is also on a different lanelet with a significant distance, posing no immediate risk of collision.

3. **Obstacle 30524.0 (at 0.9 seconds):**
   - Position: (121.8221, 378.9066)
   - Orientation: -0.2862
   - Velocity: 7.1355 m/s
   - Acceleration: -0.1801
   - Lanelet: 561.0
   - **Relative to Ego:**
     - Distance vector: ego to obstacle is approximately x = -17.7772 m, y = 4.2031 m.
     - This obstacle is in the same lanelet and relatively close.
   - **TTC & MDC:**
     - Closing in on the ego vehicle which has a lower speed.
     - Relative speed: Approximately 3.1513 m/s (7.1355 - 3.9842)
     - TTC: `Distance / Relative Speed` = 17.7 / 3.1513 â‰ˆ 5.61 seconds
     - Although the TTC is over 5 seconds, proximity within the same lanelet suggests caution is needed.
   - **Risk Assessment: Medium Risk**
     - Considering the deceleration of the ego and the presence in same lanelet.

**Overall Evaluation:**
- The closest obstacle in terms of trajectory is 30524.0, which is in the same lanelet and gradually closing in but is presently around 5.61 seconds away based on TTC calculations, suggesting a manageable medium risk when factoring deceleration patterns.

Conclusion: No obstacles present an immediate or extreme risk (scores 0 or 1). One obstacle (30524.0) is noteworthy due to proximity and lanelet sharing but remains manageable.
