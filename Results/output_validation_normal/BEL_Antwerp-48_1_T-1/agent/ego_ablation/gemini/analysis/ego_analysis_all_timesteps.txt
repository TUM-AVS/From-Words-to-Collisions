At t=0.9s, Obstacle 30519 is at a longitudinal distance of 7.45m and a lateral distance of -9.45m relative to the ego vehicle.  It is moving towards the ego longitudinally at -3.78 m/s and laterally away from the ego at -6.07 m/s. While it is approaching longitudinally, the lateral movement suggests it's diverging, reducing collision risk.

Obstacle 30521, at t=0.9s, is located at a longitudinal distance of 7.82m and a lateral distance of 15.68m.  It's moving towards the ego longitudinally (-4.43 m/s) and laterally (-5.73 m/s). This obstacle poses a greater risk than 30519 due to its closing longitudinal velocity and lateral movement towards the ego vehicle. While the lateral distance is significant, the combined velocities warrant attention.

Finally, obstacle 30524 is behind the ego at a longitudinal distance of -13.76m and directly behind it laterally (0.00m). It has a positive longitudinal velocity (3.13 m/s) indicating it is approaching the ego from behind. The lateral velocity is minimal (-0.51m/s). Though approaching, its longitudinal distance and relatively low velocity suggest ample time for reaction.
