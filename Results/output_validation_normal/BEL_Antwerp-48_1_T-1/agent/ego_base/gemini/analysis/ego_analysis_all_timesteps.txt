At t=0.9s:
- **Obstacle 30519 (Front-right):**  Longitudinal distance is decreasing, but still at 7.45m. Lateral distance is increasing (moving away).  Risk is likely medium (3) or low (4).
- **Obstacle 30521 (Front-left):** Longitudinal distance is decreasing, now at 7.82m. Lateral distance is decreasing (moving closer), but still relatively far at 15.68m. Risk is likely medium (3) or low (4).
- **Obstacle 30524 (Behind):**  Longitudinal distance is decreasing (getting closer) at -13.76m, but relative velocity indicates it's approaching rapidly at 3.13 m/s.  This obstacle poses the highest risk, likely a high risk (2).
