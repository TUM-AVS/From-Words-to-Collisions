### Safety analysis for timestep 0.9s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

**Assumptions and Clarifications:**

* Since adjusted distances (adjusted_d_long, adjusted_d_lat) are not provided, raw distances (DTClong, DTClat) will be used for this analysis.  This may lead to less precise risk assessments.
* TTC calculations will be simplified due to the lack of clear ego vehicle motion information.  A more comprehensive TTC would involve the ego vehicle's acceleration as well.
* A basic approach for TTC will be employed:  `TTC = Distance / Relative Velocity`.  If the relative velocity is positive (moving away), TTC is considered infinite (no collision risk).
*  Lateral movement analysis will not be included in calculating TTC.


### Obstacle Analysis:

**- Obstacle ID: 30519**
- Distance Risk reason: Located at 7.45m longitudinally and 7.45m laterally in the front-right. This is relatively close.
- Distance safety score: 3 (Medium Risk)
- Time Risk reason: Approaching longitudinally at -3.78 m/s.  TTC is approximately 1.97 seconds.
- Time safety score: 3 (Medium Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 3 (Medium Risk)

**- Obstacle ID: 30521**
- Distance Risk reason: Located at 7.82m longitudinally and 7.82m laterally in the front-left. This is relatively close.
- Distance safety score: 3 (Medium Risk)
- Time Risk reason: Approaching longitudinally at -4.43 m/s. TTC is approximately 1.76 seconds.
- Time safety score: 3 (Medium Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 3 (Medium Risk)

**- Obstacle ID: 30524**
- Distance Risk reason: Located at -13.76m longitudinally and -13.76m laterally (behind).
- Distance safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
- Time Risk reason:  Approaching longitudinally at 3.13 m/s (meaning it is getting closer while behind) TTC is approximately -4.39. Although the value is negative, since it is coming from behind we evaluate that the risk is not high.
- Time safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 4 (Low Risk)
