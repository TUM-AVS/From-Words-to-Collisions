### Obstacle-by-Obstacle Analysis:

#### **Obstacle 30519 (Front-right)**  
- **Latest Data (0.9s):**  
  - Adjusted longitudinal distance: 7.45 m (closing at -3.78 m/s)  
  - Adjusted lateral distance: -9.45 m (moving away at -6.07 m/s)  
  - Motion: Moving toward ego longitudinally but away laterally (right).  

- **Trajectory Analysis:**  
  - Longitudinal distance decreases (from 12.33m to 7.45m), but lateral distance increases (from -4.49m to -9.45m).  
  - No convergence in both dimensions.  

- **TTC Calculation:**  
  - Longitudinal TTC: 7.45 / 3.78 ≈ 1.97s (Medium Risk)  
  - Lateral TTC: Not applicable (moving away).  

- **MDC Calculation:**  
  - MDC is dominated by lateral distance (9.45m), which is increasing.  
  - No collision risk.  

- **Overall Risk:** **5 (Negligible Risk)**

#### **Obstacle 30521 (Front-left)**  
- **Latest Data (0.9s):**  
  - Adjusted longitudinal distance: 7.82 m (closing at -4.43 m/s)  
  - Adjusted lateral distance: 15.68 m (closing at -5.73 m/s)  
  - Motion: Approaching ego both longitudinally and laterally (left).  

- **Trajectory Analysis:**  
  - Both distances decrease (longitudinal: 13.02m → 7.82m; lateral: 20.34m → 15.68m).  
  - Convergence in both dimensions, but distances remain large.  

- **TTC Calculation:**  
  - Longitudinal TTC: 7.82 / 4.43 ≈ 1.77s (Medium Risk)  
  - Lateral TTC: 15.68 / 5.73 ≈ 2.74s (Medium Risk)  

- **MDC Calculation:**  
  - MDC is the smaller of the two distances: 7.82m (Low Risk).  

- **Overall Risk:** **3 (Medium Risk)**

#### **Obstacle 30524 (Behind)**  
- **Latest Data (0.9s):**  
  - Adjusted longitudinal distance: -13.76 m (approaching at 3.13 m/s)  
  - Adjusted lateral distance: 0.00 m (exact alignment, moving away at -0.51 m/s)  
  - Motion: Approaching longitudinally but laterally aligned (no lateral convergence).  

- **Trajectory Analysis:**  
  - Longitudinal distance decreases (from -14.53m to -13.76m), but lateral distance remains 0.00m (no lateral motion toward ego).  

- **TTC Calculation:**  
  - Longitudinal TTC: 13.76 / 3.13 ≈ 4.40s (Low Risk)  
  - Lateral TTC: Not applicable (moving away).  

- **MDC Calculation:**  
  - MDC is longitudinal (13.76m), which is large.  

- **Overall Risk:** **4 (Low Risk)**

### Key Findings:  
- No collision or extreme/high-risk obstacles detected.  
- **Obstacle 30521 (Front-left)** poses the highest risk (Medium Risk, score 3) due to convergence in both dimensions, but distances remain manageable.  
- Other obstacles are low or negligible risk.
