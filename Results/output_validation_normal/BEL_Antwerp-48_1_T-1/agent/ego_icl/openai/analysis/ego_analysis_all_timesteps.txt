Let's analyze each obstacle using the data from the most recent timestep (0.9 seconds) and referencing past trajectories for context:

### Obstacle 30519:
1. **Position and Movement:**
   - Front-right of the ego car.
   - Adjusted longitudinal distance: 7.45 m.
   - Adjusted lateral distance: -9.45 m.
   - Moving toward the ego car longitudinally and away laterally to the right.
2. **Relative Motion:**
   - Longitudinal velocity: -3.78 m/s (closing).
   - Lateral velocity: -6.07 m/s (moving away).
3. **Risk Calculations:**
   - **TTC (Longitudinal):** \( \text{TTC} = \frac{7.45}{3.78} \approx 1.97 \, \text{seconds} \) (Medium Risk: 3)
   - **MDC:** Adjusted longitudinal component is primary due to approaching motion; however, lateral movement reduces proximity concern.
4. **Assessment:**
   - Longitudinal TTC suggests medium risk, but lateral motion moving away reduces overall concern.
   - **Final Risk Score:** 3 (Medium Risk)

### Obstacle 30521:
1. **Position and Movement:**
   - Front-left of the ego car.
   - Adjusted longitudinal distance: 7.82 m.
   - Adjusted lateral distance: 15.68 m.
   - Moving toward the ego car both longitudinally and laterally.
2. **Relative Motion:**
   - Longitudinal velocity: -4.43 m/s (closing).
   - Lateral velocity: -5.73 m/s (closing).
3. **Risk Calculations:**
   - **TTC (Longitudinal):** \( \text{TTC} = \frac{7.82}{4.43} \approx 1.77 \, \text{seconds} \) (Medium Risk: 3)
   - **MDC:** Both distances reduce, but trajectory is across a larger lateral gap.
4. **Assessment:**
   - Although both directions are closing, relative distances maintain a low medium risk.
   - **Final Risk Score:** 3 (Medium Risk)

### Obstacle 30524:
1. **Position and Movement:**
   - Behind the ego car.
   - Adjusted longitudinal distance: -13.76 m.
   - Exact lateral alignment (0.00 m).
   - Moving toward the ego car longitudinally.
2. **Relative Motion:**
   - Longitudinal velocity: 3.13 m/s (approaching).
   - Lateral velocity: -0.51 m/s.
3. **Risk Calculations:**
   - As it is behind, the positive relative velocity reduces immediate concern.
   - **MDC:** Longitudinal gap remains significant; lateral proximity is aligned but non-colliding.
4. **Assessment:**
   - Does not present a collision threat due to significant distance.
   - **Final Risk Score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)

        "ObstacleID": "30524",
        "OverallRiskScore": "5"
    }
}
```

### Conclusion:
- Obstacle 30519 and 30521 pose medium risks due to their trajectories converging toward the ego vehicle, but not at an immediate collision threat level.
- Obstacle 30524, while aligned laterally, is safely distant in the longitudinal direction, offering a negligible risk.
