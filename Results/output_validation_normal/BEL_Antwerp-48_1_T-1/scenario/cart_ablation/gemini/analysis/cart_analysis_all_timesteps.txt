At t=0.9s, Ego (30523.0) is in lanelet 561.0 at (139.5993, 374.7035) with a velocity of 3.9842 m/s.

Obstacle 30524.0 is also in lanelet 561.0 at (121.8221, 378.9066) with a velocity of 7.1355 m/s.  While the y-coordinates suggest some lateral separation, the x-coordinates show Obstacle 30524.0 rapidly approaching Ego from behind. Given the speed differential and closing distance, an extreme risk of collision exists within the next few timesteps if obstacle 30524.0 doesn't decelerate significantly or change lanes.

Obstacles 30519.0 and 30521.0 are in different lanelets and pose no immediate threat.
