At t=0.9s, Ego (30523.0) is in lanelet 561.0 at (139.5993, 374.7035).

Obstacle 30524.0 is also in lanelet 561.0 at (121.8221, 378.9066). While the y-coordinates (lateral position) suggest some separation, the x-coordinates (longitudinal position) indicate 30524.0 is significantly behind Ego and moving slower.  Given the trajectories over the past timesteps, a collision is unlikely. This is a low risk.

Obstacles 30519.0 and 30521.0 are in different lanelets (169.0 and 167.0, respectively) and pose no immediate threat based on their current positions and trajectories.
