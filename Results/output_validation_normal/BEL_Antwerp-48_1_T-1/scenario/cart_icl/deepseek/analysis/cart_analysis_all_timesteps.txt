### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:
#### Obstacle ID: 30519.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is in a different lanelet (169.0) and moving away from the ego vehicle (X-coordinate decreasing). The distance is increasing over time.
- **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- **Time Risk reason**: The obstacle's velocity is higher than the ego's, and it is moving away. Relative velocity indicates no imminent collision.
- **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- **Overall Risk score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)

#### Obstacle ID: 30521.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is in a different lanelet (167.0) and moving away from the ego vehicle (Y-coordinate decreasing). The distance is increasing over time.
- **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- **Time Risk reason**: The obstacle's velocity is higher than the ego's, and it is moving away. Relative velocity indicates no imminent collision.
- **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- **Overall Risk score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)

#### Obstacle ID: 30524.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is in the same lanelet (561.0) as the ego vehicle but is moving away (X-coordinate increasing). The distance is increasing over time.
- **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
- **Time Risk reason**: The obstacle's velocity is higher than the ego's, and it is moving away. Relative velocity indicates no imminent collision.
- **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
- **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low Risk)

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. **Obstacle 30519.0**: In a different lanelet and moving away. No collision risk.
2. **Obstacle 30521.0**: In a different lanelet and moving away. No collision risk.
3. **Obstacle 30524.0**: In the same lanelet but moving away. Low risk due to increasing distance.
4. **Ego Vehicle**: Decelerating, reducing collision risk further.
5. **Conclusion**: No collision or extreme risk scenarios detected.
