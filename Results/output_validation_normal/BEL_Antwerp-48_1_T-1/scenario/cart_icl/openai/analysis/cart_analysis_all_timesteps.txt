- **Time Safety Score:** 5
- **Overall Risk Score:** 5

#### Obstacle 30526.0
- **Distance Risk Reasoning:** Lanelet 559.0, far from egoâ€™s trajectory, large lateral gap.
- **Distance Safety Score:** 5
- **Time Risk Reasoning:** Consistent large negative acceleration, no direct path towards ego.
- **Time Safety Score:** 5
- **Overall Risk Score:** 5

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis
The ego vehicle does not face immediate collision threats from any obstacles as most are in different lanelets or moving away. Obstacle 30524.0, while in the same lanelet, maintains a safe distance at this timestep, with no substantial risk of collision. Overall, this is not a collision scenario given the distances and velocities involved.
