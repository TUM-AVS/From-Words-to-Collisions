Obstacle 30519 is moving away laterally and its longitudinal velocity is decreasing, suggesting reduced risk. Obstacle 30521 is approaching both longitudinally and laterally, posing a potential risk. Obstacle 30524 is approaching from behind, also a potential risk but less immediate than 30521 due to the greater longitudinal distance.  At the most recent timestep, no obstacle poses an immediate collision risk. However, 30521 requires close monitoring due to its converging trajectory.
