At t=0.9s:
- **Obstacle 30519 (Front-right):**  Longitudinal distance is decreasing, indicating continued approach, but the lateral distance is increasing, suggesting the obstacle is moving further to the right and away from the ego vehicle's path. This obstacle does not pose an immediate collision risk.
- **Obstacle 30521 (Front-left):** This obstacle is getting closer both longitudinally and laterally, posing a potential risk. However, at the current distances (7.82m longitudinal and 15.68m lateral), a collision is not imminent in the next timestep.  This requires monitoring.
- **Obstacle 30524 (Behind):** This obstacle is approaching the ego vehicle rapidly from behind (longitudinal velocity 3.13 m/s). Although directly behind, the longitudinal distance is still -13.76m suggesting the risk is not extreme. Continuous monitoring is crucial.

Since no obstacle poses an immediate collision risk within the next timestep, the scenario is not considered a collision scenario at this point.


**Risk Levels and Definitions:**
<Collision (Score: 0)>: Actual collision has occurred or is unavoidable within the next timestep.
<Extreme Risk (Score: 1)>: Immediate collision or very high likelihood of impact. Urgent action is required.
<High Risk (Score: 2)>: Close to collision or highly probable collision path. Needs prompt attention and quick manoeuvring.
<Medium Risk (Score: 3)>: Moderate collision risk but manageable with timely reactions and proper strategies.
<Low Risk (Score: 4)>: Minimal collision risk. The situation is controllable with sufficient time to react.
<Negligible Risk (Score: 5)>: No significant collision risk. Obstacles are either moving away or far enough not to interfere.
