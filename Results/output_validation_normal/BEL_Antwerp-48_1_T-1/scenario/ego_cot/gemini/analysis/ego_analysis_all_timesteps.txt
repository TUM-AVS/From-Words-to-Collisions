### Safety analysis for timestep 0.9 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

There are no adjusted distances provided. I will use the provided real distances (DTClong, DTClat) and relative velocities (Vrel_long, Vrel_lat) to estimate TTC and perform the risk assessment.  It's crucial to understand that without adjusted distances or vehicle dimensions, this analysis will be less precise.

**Assumptions (due to lack of adjusted distances and ego vehicle information):**

* I will assume a simplified collision box for the ego vehicle and obstacles.
* Lateral movement away from the ego vehicle, even if the obstacle is approaching longitudinally, will be considered a mitigating factor for risk.



### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 30519**
- Distance Risk reason:  Located at 7.45m longitudinally and 7.45m laterally in the front-right.  This is moderately close, and the lateral movement away reduces the risk somewhat.
- Distance safety score: 3 (Medium Risk)
- Time Risk reason:  TTC calculation is complex without precise relative velocities and accelerations. Given the reducing longitudinal distance and the lateral movement away, the risk appears moderate.
- Time safety score: 3 (Medium Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 3 (Medium Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 30521**
- Distance Risk reason: Located at 7.82m longitudinally and 7.82m laterally in the front-left.  The relatively close longitudinal distance poses a concern.
- Distance safety score: 2 (High Risk)
- Time Risk reason:  Similar to 30519, TTC is difficult to determine precisely. The longitudinal approach combined with lateral movement towards the ego vehicle increases the risk.
- Time safety score: 2 (High Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 2 (High Risk)


- **Obstacle ID: 30524**
- Distance Risk reason: Located 13.76m behind the ego vehicle.  The longitudinal distance suggests no immediate risk.
- Distance safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
- Time Risk reason:  The obstacle is approaching the ego vehicle from behind, but the distance is substantial enough to offer reaction time. 
- Time safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 4 (Low Risk)



### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
    "CollisionObstacle": null,
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null,
    "IsCollisionScenario": false,
    "Justification": "While some obstacles (30521 in particular) present a high risk due to their proximity and movement towards the ego vehicle, the current snapshot at 0.9 seconds doesn't indicate an immediate collision. However, the situation requires careful monitoring and potential evasive maneuvers, especially regarding obstacle 30521."
