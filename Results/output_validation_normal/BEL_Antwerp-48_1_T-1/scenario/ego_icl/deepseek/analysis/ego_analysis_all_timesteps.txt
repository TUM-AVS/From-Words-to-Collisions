### Obstacle-by-Obstacle Analysis (Most Recent Timestep: 0.9s)

#### **Obstacle 30519 (Front-right)**
- **Adjusted Position**: Longitudinal 7.45m, Lateral -9.45m  
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal -3.78 m/s (approaching), Lateral -6.07 m/s (moving away)  
- **Motion**: Driving toward ego longitudinally but moving away laterally to the right.  

**TTC Calculation**:
- Longitudinal TTC = 7.45 / 3.78 ≈ 1.97s (Medium Risk)  
- Lateral TTC = N/A (moving away, no collision risk)  

**MDC Calculation**:
- Since the obstacle is moving away laterally, MDC is effectively the current lateral distance (9.45m, No Risk).  
- Longitudinal MDC is 7.45m (Low Risk).  

**Overall Risk**: Medium Risk (3) due to longitudinal approach.

#### **Obstacle 30521 (Front-left)**
- **Adjusted Position**: Longitudinal 7.82m, Lateral 15.68m  
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal -4.43 m/s (approaching), Lateral -5.73 m/s (approaching from left).  
- **Motion**: Driving toward ego both longitudinally and laterally.  

**TTC Calculation**:
- Longitudinal TTC = 7.82 / 4.43 ≈ 1.77s (Medium Risk)  
- Lateral TTC = 15.68 / 5.73 ≈ 2.74s (Medium Risk)  

**MDC Calculation**:
- Projected paths show both distances decreasing. MDC is the smaller distance (longitudinal 7.82m, Low Risk).  

**Overall Risk**: Medium Risk (3) due to converging trajectories.

#### **Obstacle 30524 (Behind)**
- **Adjusted Position**: Longitudinal -13.76m, Lateral 0.00m  
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal 3.13 m/s (approaching from behind), Lateral -0.51 m/s (minor lateral drift).  
- **Motion**: Driving toward ego from behind with exact lateral alignment.  

**TTC Calculation**:
- Longitudinal TTC = 13.76 / 3.13 ≈ 4.40s (Low Risk)  
- Lateral TTC = N/A (no lateral convergence).  

**MDC Calculation**:
- Lateral distance is 0.00m, but trajectories are not converging laterally (ego and obstacle are aligned). Longitudinal MDC is 13.76m (No Risk).  

**Overall Risk**: Low Risk (4) due to slow approach from behind.

### Trajectory Analysis
- **Obstacle 30519**: Moving away laterally but closing longitudinally. No imminent collision.  
- **Obstacle 30521**: Converging diagonally but distances remain large (>7m).  
- **Obstacle 30524**: Slowly approaching from behind with no lateral risk.  

### Final Determination
- **No obstacles** meet the criteria for Collision (0) or Extreme Risk (1).  
- Highest risk is Medium (Obstacles 30519 and 30521).
