* **Obstacle 30519 (Front-Right):**

    * **Trajectory:** This obstacle has been consistently moving closer to the ego vehicle longitudinally while moving further away laterally to the right across all timesteps.
    * **At t=0.9s:**
        * Longitudinal distance: 7.45m
        * Lateral distance: -9.45m (moving away)
        * Longitudinal relative velocity: -3.78 m/s (approaching)
        * Lateral relative velocity: -6.07 m/s (moving away)
    * **TTC:**
        * Longitudinal TTC = 7.45m / 3.78m/s = 1.97s
    * **MDC:** Due to the diverging lateral trajectory, the MDC is primarily determined by the longitudinal distance.  MDC ≈ 7.45m.
    * **Risk:**
        * Longitudinal risk: Medium (3) based on TTC.
        * Lateral risk: No Risk (5) due to increasing distance and diverging trajectory.
        * Overall Risk: Medium (3)

* **Obstacle 30521 (Front-Left):**

    * **Trajectory:** This obstacle is approaching the ego vehicle both longitudinally and laterally (from the left) across all timesteps.
    * **At t=0.9s:**
        * Longitudinal distance: 7.82m
        * Lateral distance: 15.68m (approaching from the left)
        * Longitudinal relative velocity: -4.43 m/s (approaching)
        * Lateral relative velocity: -5.73 m/s (approaching)
    * **TTC:**
        * Longitudinal TTC: 7.82m / 4.43m/s ≈ 1.77s
        * Lateral TTC: 15.68m / 5.73m/s ≈ 2.74s
    * **MDC:** Considering the converging trajectories, we should focus on the longitudinal distance.  MDC ≈ 7.82m.
    * **Risk:**
        * Longitudinal Risk: Medium (3) based on TTC.
        * Lateral Risk: Medium (3) based on TTC, although lateral distance is large enough to be considered low risk in isolation.
        * Overall Risk: Medium (3)

* **Obstacle 30524 (Behind):**

    * **Trajectory:** Initially moving away, this obstacle has been consistently approaching the ego vehicle longitudinally from behind while maintaining exact lateral alignment.
    * **At t=0.9s:**
        * Longitudinal distance: -13.76m (behind)
        * Lateral distance: 0.00m (exact alignment)
        * Longitudinal relative velocity: 3.13 m/s (approaching from behind)
        * Lateral relative velocity: -0.51 m/s
    * **TTC:**
        * Longitudinal TTC: 13.76m / 3.13 m/s ≈ 4.39s
    * **MDC:** The critical distance here is the lateral distance. MDC = 0.00m indicates the obstacle is currently directly behind the ego vehicle, and should be treated with great caution.
    * **Risk:**
        * Longitudinal risk: Low (4) based on TTC.
        * Lateral risk: High (2) due to direct alignment and the obstacle closing in from behind (MDC = 0m).
        * Overall Risk: High (2) due to the potential for a rear-end collision if lateral movement occurs.

**Collision Scenario Determination:**

No obstacle has a risk score of 0 (collision) or 1 (extreme risk). Therefore, this is NOT a collision scenario. However, obstacle 30524 poses a high risk due to its position directly behind the ego vehicle and closing speed.

**JSON Summary:**

```json
{
  "CollisionObstacle": {},
  "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {},
  "IsCollisionScenario": false,
  "Justification": "No obstacle has a risk score of 0 or 1. While obstacle 30524 presents a High Risk (2) from behind and has a lateral position of 0.00m, the longitudinal TTC remains 4.39s indicating no immediate collision"
}
