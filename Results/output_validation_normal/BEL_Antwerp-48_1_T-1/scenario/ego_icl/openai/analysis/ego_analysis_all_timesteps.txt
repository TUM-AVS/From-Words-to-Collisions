Let's analyze the risk for each obstacle at the most recent timestep (0.9 seconds), using the adjusted distances for accurate assessment.

### Analysis

#### Obstacle 30519 (Front-Right)
- **Adjusted Longitudinal Distance**: 7.45 m
- **Adjusted Lateral Distance**: -9.45 m
- **Relative Longitudinal Velocity**: -3.78 m/s (closing in)
- **Relative Lateral Velocity**: -6.07 m/s (moving away to the right)

**TTC Calculation**
- Longitudinal TTC = 7.45 m / 3.78 m/s ≈ 1.97 seconds
- Lateral TTC is irrelevant since it's moving away laterally.

**MDC**: Lateral movement is significant, increasing separation laterally despite closing longitudinally. Therefore, MDC is primarily influenced by longitudinal proximity, so approximately 7.45 m.

**Risk Assessment**: The calculated longitudinal TTC is within 3 seconds, prompting a Medium Risk (3) assessment. However, since the obstacle is angled away laterally, the risk doesn't escalate.

#### Obstacle 30521 (Front-Left)
- **Adjusted Longitudinal Distance**: 7.82 m
- **Adjusted Lateral Distance**: 15.68 m
- **Relative Longitudinal Velocity**: -4.43 m/s (closing in)
- **Relative Lateral Velocity**: -5.73 m/s (moving towards)

**TTC Calculation**
- Longitudinal TTC = 7.82 m / 4.43 m/s ≈ 1.77 seconds
- Lateral TTC = 15.68 m / 5.73 m/s ≈ 2.73 seconds

**MDC**: With both longitudinal and lateral components closing, consider the tighter of the distances: 7.82 m (longitudinal).

**Risk Assessment**: Given the converging velocities on both axes, this results in a Medium Risk (3) as the trajectories are closing significantly but remain over safe distances for now.

#### Obstacle 30524 (Behind)
- **Adjusted Longitudinal Distance**: -13.76 m (behind)
- **Adjusted Lateral Distance**: 0.00 m (exact alignment)
- **Relative Longitudinal Velocity**: 3.13 m/s (approaching from behind)

**TTC Calculation**
- Longitudinal TTC is negative since the obstacle is currently decreasing the gap from behind, so actual proximity is not imminent for collision given relative velocities.

**MDC**: Given that it's moving relative from behind with a lateral alignment, lateral MDC is governed by the exact alignment but not critical due to safe longitudinal distance.

**Risk Assessment**: Based on a stable and secure evolution of separation from the ego, it results in a Low Risk (4) due to longitudinal handling.

### Conclusion
- No obstacle currently indicates imminent collision, though closures prompt medium vigilance.
- None reach Extreme or immediate Collision risk settings.
