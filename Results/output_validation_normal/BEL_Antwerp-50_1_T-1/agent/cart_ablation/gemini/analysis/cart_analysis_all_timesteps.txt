Obstacle 30634 is in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle and is moving with a similar velocity.  Initially, it is ahead of the ego vehicle. However, its x-position is consistently increasing while the ego vehicle's x-position is also increasing.  The difference in their y-positions suggests that they are somewhat close, and the small fluctuations in obstacle 30634's acceleration could lead to a closer proximity. Therefore, this obstacle requires monitoring.

Obstacle 30633 is in a different lanelet and poses less risk. It's important to note that lanelet changes aren't mentioned, so assuming lanelet 1136 (and later 1135) are separate and parallel to lanelet 321.  It's spatially further from the ego vehicle.

Obstacle 30638 appears at 0.7 seconds and is also in a different lanelet (1337). Currently, it poses no immediate risk due to the spatial separation.  However, its high velocity and strong negative acceleration need to be observed in subsequent timesteps.

Considering the present data, obstacle 30634 represents a potential risk due to the proximity and shared lanelet with the ego vehicle.  No immediate collision is imminent, but the situation needs monitoring, placing it at a High-Risk level.
