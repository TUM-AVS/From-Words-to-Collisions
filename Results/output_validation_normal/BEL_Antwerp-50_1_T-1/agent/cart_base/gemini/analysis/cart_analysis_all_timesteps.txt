Obstacle 30634 is in the same lane as the ego vehicle and initially relatively close.  Over the provided time steps, obstacle 30634's y-coordinate is consistently and significantly smaller (meaning it's ahead of the ego vehicle). While its velocity is similar to the ego vehicle, the distance between them is increasing, suggesting a low risk of collision.

Obstacle 30633 is in a different lane and its y-coordinate is also smaller than the ego vehicle's, indicating it is ahead and to the right.  The trajectories don't appear to intersect in the near future. This also suggests a low risk of collision.

Obstacle 30638 appears at 0.7 seconds and is relatively far from the ego vehicle and in a different lane.  There's no immediate indication of a collision risk.
