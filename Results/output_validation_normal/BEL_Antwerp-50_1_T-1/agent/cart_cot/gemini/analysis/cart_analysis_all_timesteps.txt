At t=0.9s, the ego vehicle (ID 30636) is at (161.8967, -294.6467) with a velocity of 5.3467 and heading -1.4655 rad. We analyze its interaction with three obstacles:

* **Obstacle 30633:** Located at (165.2989, -312.8963), velocity 5.5277, heading -1.0331 rad. This obstacle is laterally separated and poses no immediate threat due to the lane boundaries.  Its trajectory indicates it's moving away from the ego vehicle.

* **Obstacle 30634:** Located at (159.5545, -272.4999), velocity 8.9079, heading -1.4655 rad. This obstacle is in the same lane as the ego vehicle, but ahead and moving faster.  While the current separation is safe, the closing velocity needs monitoring.

* **Obstacle 30638:** Located at (178.7082, -315.6195), velocity 9.1657, heading 2.661 rad. This obstacle poses no immediate threat due to its significant lateral and longitudinal separation.

**Calculations and Reasoning:**

Due to the different lane assignments and orientations, collision is highly unlikely with obstacles 30633 and 30638 within the foreseeable future. Therefore, we focus our analysis on obstacle 30634.

* **TTC (Longitudinal):**  Approximating both vehicles' motion as linear, we can estimate the time to collision.  The relative velocity is 8.9079 - 5.3467 = 3.5612.  The longitudinal separation is 272.4999 - 294.6467 = -22.1468.  Thus, the approximate time to collision is -22.1468 / 3.5612 â‰ˆ -6.2 seconds. The negative value indicates the obstacle is ahead and moving away relative to the ego vehicle's current slower speed.

* **MDC (Lateral):** Negligible, as both vehicles are largely within the same lane.


**Risk Assessment:**

* **Obstacle 30633:** Negligible Risk (5) - Different lanes, moving away.
* **Obstacle 30634:** Low Risk (4) - Same lane, but obstacle is ahead and moving slightly faster.  Sufficient time and space to react if necessary.  Continuous monitoring is needed.
* **Obstacle 30638:** Negligible Risk (5) -  Far away, different lane and orientation.
