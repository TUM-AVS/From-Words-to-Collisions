At t=0.9s, the ego vehicle (ID 30636) is located at (161.8967, -294.6467) with a velocity of 5.3467 and acceleration of -2.013.  Let's analyze the risk posed by each obstacle:

* **Obstacle 30633:** Located at (165.2989, -312.8963), this obstacle is relatively far from the ego vehicle, laterally and longitudinally.  While it shows a trend of slight lateral movement towards the ego vehicle's lanelet, the current distance and differing lanelet suggest a low risk.

* **Obstacle 30634:** Located at (159.5545, -272.4999), this obstacle is in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle and ahead. The obstacle's velocity (8.9079) is greater than the ego vehicle's and the distance is increasing. This indicates a low risk, tending towards negligible.

* **Obstacle 30638:** Located at (178.7082, -315.6195), this obstacle is significantly far laterally and longitudinally, posing no immediate threat. Its motion doesn't indicate a high risk of future collision either.

Overall, at t=0.9s, no obstacle presents an immediate collision risk. Obstacle 30633 requires further monitoring in subsequent time steps due to its lateral movement, although the current risk is low.
