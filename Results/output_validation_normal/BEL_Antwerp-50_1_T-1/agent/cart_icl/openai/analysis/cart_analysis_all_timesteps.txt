### Detailed Evaluation

At the most recent timestep (0.9 seconds), the positions, velocities, orientations, and accelerations of the ego vehicle and obstacles are provided. We need to assess the risk posed by each obstacle in the context of the ego vehicle's current behavior.

#### Ego Vehicle (ID: 30636)
- Position: (161.8967, -294.6467)
- Velocity: 5.3467 m/s
- Orientation remains relatively constant over time, indicating a roughly stable trajectory albeit with deceleration.

#### Obstacle Analyses

1. **Obstacle 30633**
   - Position at 0.9 seconds: (165.2989, -312.8963)
   - Velocity: 5.5277 m/s, increasing steadily
   - Trajectory: Located behind and to the left of the ego vehicle.
   - Relative longitudinal position: Behind by approximately 18.25m in terms of y-axis.
   - Relative lateral position: Ahead by approximately 3.4m on x-axis.
   - The increasing speed may slightly reduce the longitudinal distance, but the lateral gap remains sufficient.
   - **TTC is positive and relatively large**, indicating no immediate risk of collision. **Risk: Low (4)**

2. **Obstacle 30634**
   - Position at 0.9 seconds: (159.5545, -272.4999)
   - Velocity: 8.9079 m/s, relatively constant
   - Located within the same lanelet as the ego.
   - Relative longitudinal position: Ahead by approximately 22.15m in terms of y-axis.
   - Relative lateral position: Behind by 2.34m on x-axis.
   - **This obstacle is in the same lane but significantly ahead.**

   - **TTC = 22.15 / (8.9079 - 5.3467) = 22.15 / 3.5612 = 6.22s** (positive, indicating sufficient time).
   - **MDC is high with significant longitudinal distance.** **Risk: Medium (3)**

3. **Obstacle 30638**
   - Position at 0.9 seconds: (178.7082, -315.6195)
   - Velocity: 9.1657 m/s
   - Relative longitudinal position: Approaching from a different lanelet, far behind.
   - Relative lateral position: In a different lanelet, far on x-axis.
   - **There is no trajectory overlap.** **Risk: Negligible (5)**

### Summary of Key Risks

No obstacles are imposing an immediate collision risk or extreme risk. The highest risk level observed is Medium due to the proximity and same-lane presence of Obstacle ID 30634 but still manageable considering the distance and TTC.
