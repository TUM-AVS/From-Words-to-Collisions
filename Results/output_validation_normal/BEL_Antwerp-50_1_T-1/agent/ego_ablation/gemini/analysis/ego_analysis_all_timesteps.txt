At t=0.9s, Obstacle 30633 is in front of the ego vehicle, with a longitudinal distance of 14.00m and lateral distance of 0.00m. The relative longitudinal velocity is -0.33 m/s, indicating it is slowly moving towards the ego vehicle.  The lateral relative velocity is 2.32 m/s, suggesting it might be starting to move laterally away from the ego vehicle's path.  However, the decreasing longitudinal distance warrants close monitoring.

Obstacle 30634 is behind the ego vehicle at a longitudinal distance of -17.76m and a lateral distance of 0.0 m. Its relative longitudinal velocity is 3.56 m/s, meaning that it is approaching the ego vehicle from behind, albeit at a safe distance for now. There appears to be negligible lateral movement.

Obstacle 30638 is located front-left of the ego vehicle at a longitudinal distance of 18.12m and lateral distance of 12.90m.  Its relative longitudinal velocity is -10.41 m/s and lateral velocity is -7.64 m/s, indicating it is moving towards the ego vehicle both longitudinally and laterally from the left side. This obstacle poses a potential risk and requires careful monitoring.  While not immediately dangerous, the high closing speeds mean this obstacle has the greatest potential for a collision within the next few seconds.  It presents a higher risk than Obstacle 30633.
