At t=0.9s, Obstacle 30633 is in front of the ego vehicle, moving towards it longitudinally at a slow relative velocity (-0.33 m/s) and a distance of 14.00m.  Laterally, it's exhibiting some movement towards the ego car (2.32 m/s), but still at 0.00m lateral distance. This obstacle presents a medium risk (3) due to the closing longitudinal distance, even with the slow relative velocity, and the uncertain lateral movement.

Obstacle 30634 is behind the ego vehicle, moving towards it from behind (3.56 m/s) at a distance of -17.76m.  The lateral movement is negligible.  This obstacle poses a low risk (4) due to the substantial distance and the ego vehicle likely moving away based on other obstacle data.

Obstacle 30638 is in front and to the left of the ego vehicle. It is approaching the ego vehicle both longitudinally (-10.41 m/s) and laterally (-7.64 m/s).  With distances of 18.12m longitudinally and 12.90m laterally, this obstacle presents a high risk (2) due to the high closing velocities and relatively short distances.
