### Safety analysis for timestep 0.9 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

**Assumptions and Calculations:**

Since the provided scenario only includes real distances and not adjusted distances, I will use the real distances for the calculations.  In a real-world application, you would *always* use the adjusted distances which consider vehicle size and safe margins.  I will also assume a simplified TTC calculation: `TTC = Distance / Relative Velocity`. This calculation doesn't account for acceleration, which is a simplification.

**### Obstacle Analysis:**

**- Obstacle ID: 30633**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is in front, longitudinally at 14.00m and laterally at 14.00m.  This is moderately close, especially considering the lateral movement.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason:  The relative longitudinal velocity is -0.33 m/s (approaching).  TTC_long is 14.00 / 0.33 = 42.4 seconds.  The relative lateral velocity is 2.32 m/s. TTC_lat is 14 / 2.32 = 6.03 seconds. The lateral TTC raises concern.
- Time safety score: 2
- Overall Risk score: 2

**- Obstacle ID: 30634**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is behind, longitudinally at -17.76m and laterally at -17.76m. This poses no immediate risk.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Though the obstacle is behind and moving closer (relative longitudinal velocity of 3.56 m/s), it's still a safe distance away.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

**- Obstacle ID: 30638**
- Distance Risk reason:  Obstacle is in front-left, at 18.12m longitudinally and laterally.  This is a moderate distance, but the diagonal movement and closing velocities increase the risk.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: The relative longitudinal velocity is -10.41 m/s (rapidly approaching). TTC_long is 18.12 / 10.41 = 1.74 seconds. Relative lateral velocity is -7.64 m/s (also rapidly approaching from the left). TTC_lat is 18.12 / 7.64 = 2.37 seconds. These are short TTC values indicating high risk.
- Time safety score: 2
- Overall Risk score: 2
