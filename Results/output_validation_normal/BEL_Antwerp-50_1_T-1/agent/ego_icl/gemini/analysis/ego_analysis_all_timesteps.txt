* **Obstacle 30633 (Front):** This obstacle is directly in front of the ego vehicle and laterally aligned (0.00m lateral distance) throughout all timesteps. The longitudinal distance decreases from 16.39m to 14.00m over 0.9 seconds, indicating closing behavior. The relative longitudinal velocity is negative and its magnitude is decreasing (-4.51 m/s to -0.33 m/s), implying the closing speed is reducing. Given the near-zero longitudinal velocity at the last timestep, the TTC is very large if calculated directly, but the closing motion and small distance warrants closer inspection. Considering the latest longitudinal distance of 14.00m and the decreasing but still negative longitudinal velocity, the risk level is assessed as Medium (3) due to the proximity and the potential for future closing. Although lateral distance is zero, this doesn't imply collision as per instructions. The MDC is primarily determined by the longitudinal distance here (14.00m), thus MDC based risk is Low (4).

* **Obstacle 30634 (Behind):** This obstacle is directly behind the ego vehicle with exact lateral alignment (0.00m lateral distance) across all timesteps. The longitudinal distance (negative, since behind) decreases in magnitude from -18.92m to -17.76m. Critically, the relative longitudinal velocity is positive and increases from 0.46m/s to 3.56 m/s, meaning this obstacle is approaching the ego vehicle from behind and accelerating. Considering the decreasing distance, increasing positive velocity and the relatively small distance, this suggests a High (2) risk level.  The MDC is based on the longitudinal distance (17.76m), and thus MDC based risk is Low (4). We prioritize TTC based risk here.

* **Obstacle 30638 (Front-Left):** This obstacle is diagonally positioned from the ego vehicle. Both longitudinal and lateral distances are decreasing across timesteps (20.49m to 18.12m longitudinally, 14.42m to 12.90m laterally), suggesting a closing trajectory. The negative relative velocities (-10.41m/s longitudinally and -7.64m/s laterally) reinforce this. Considering the diagonal movement and closing behavior in both dimensions, MDC will be smaller than either of the longitudinal or lateral distances. Without precise trajectory projection, a conservative estimate based on the smaller lateral distance (12.90m) suggest a Low Risk (4) according to MDC criteria. Given the velocities and distances TTC_longitudinal =  18.12m / 10.41 m/s = 1.74s, and TTC_lateral = 12.90 / 7.64 = 1.69s. The lower TTC suggests a Medium Risk (3). We choose the risk level based on TTC.
