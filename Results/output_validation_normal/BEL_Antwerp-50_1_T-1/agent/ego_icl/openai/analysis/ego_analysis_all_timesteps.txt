### Obstacle Analysis

#### Obstacle 30633 (Front)
- **Position and Trajectory**
  - At 0.9s: Adjusted Distances: longitudinal 14.0m, lateral 0.00m.
  - Relative Longitudinal Velocity: -0.33 m/s (approaching).
  - Relative Longitudinal Acceleration: 1.19 m/sÂ².
  - **Trajectory**: Approaching but slowing down over time as velocity is decreasing, but still on a converging path.
  
- **Calculations**
  - **TTC**: \( \frac{14.00}{0.33} \approx 42.42s \) (Longitudinal direction)
  - **MDC**: 14.0m (Longitudinal)
  
- **Risk Assessment**
  - **TTC** is greater than 5 seconds indicating no immediate collision risk.
  - **MDC** is greater than 5.0m.
  - Given the decelerating trajectory, Longitudinal distance, and velocity, the risk is negligible.
  
#### Obstacle 30634 (Behind)
- **Position and Trajectory**
  - At 0.9s: Adjusted Distances: longitudinal -17.76m, lateral 0.00m.
  - Relative Longitudinal Velocity: 3.56 m/s (approaching).
  - **Trajectory**: Obstacle accelerating toward the ego vehicle.

- **Calculations**
  - **TTC**: \( \frac{17.76}{3.56} \approx 4.99s \) (Longitudinal direction)
  - **MDC**: -17.76m (Longitudinal: behind ego)

- **Risk Assessment**
  - While the **TTC** suggests a low risk, the velocity is converging. However, it's crucial to note the alignment situation with lateral exact alignment.
  - Risk is **Low** since the calculated TTC is close to 5 seconds, yet within safe limits with current trajectory progress.
  
#### Obstacle 30638 (Front-Left)
- **Position and Trajectory**
  - At 0.9s: Adjusted Distances: longitudinal 18.12m, lateral 12.90m.
  - Relative Longitudinal Velocity: -10.41 m/s (approaching).
  - Relative Lateral Velocity: -7.64 m/s (approaching from the left).
  - **Trajectory**: Approaching rapidly from a diagonal with both dimensions decreasing.

- **Calculations**
  - **Longitudinal TTC**: \( \frac{18.12}{10.41} \approx 1.74s \)
  - **Lateral TTC**: \( \frac{12.90}{7.64} \approx 1.69s \)
  - **MDC**: Could intersect within diagonal projection, but currently, it appears far given the current wide positions.

- **Risk Assessment**
  - Both dimensions are closing quickly, indicating a potentially high risk.
  - **TTC** for both dimensions shows the values around 1.7s, landing in the Medium risk category. 

### Summary
Given the analyses:

```json
{
    "CollisionObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "None",
        "OverallRiskScore": "None"
    },
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "None",
        "OverallRiskScore": "None"
    },
    "HighRiskObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "30638",
        "OverallRiskScore": "2"
    }
}
```

- **Obstacle 30633** and **30634** pose low/negligible risks. However, careful observation is needed if relative velocities shift.
- **Obstacle 30638**, with its rapid convergence from a diagonal, currently presents the highest risk among considered notwithstanding a High Risk rather than Extreme, given the current relative distances and converging velocities.
