At t=0.9s, Ego (30636.0) is in lanelet 321.0 at (161.8967, -294.6467) with a velocity of 5.3467 m/s.

Obstacle 30633.0 is in lanelet 1135.0 at (165.2989, -312.8963).  While the y-coordinate difference is significant, the x-coordinate difference is only ~3.4 meters.  Given the trajectories and the fact that lanelet 1135.0 may intersect or merge with 321.0 shortly (obstacle 30633.0 was previously in 1136.0), a collision risk cannot be ruled out with certainty in the next few timesteps. However, based on the current snapshot, it's not an *extreme* risk.

Obstacle 30634.0 is in the same lanelet (321.0) as Ego at (159.5545, -272.4999). This obstacle is behind Ego by ~2.3 meters in the x-direction and ~22 meters in the y-direction, posing no immediate threat.

Obstacle 30638.0 is in lanelet 1337.0 at (178.7082, -315.6195), which seems spatially separated from Ego's current location and trajectory.

Based on the provided data for t=0.9s, no obstacle presents an extreme or collision risk.

  "ScenarioAnalysis": {
    "IsCollisionScenario": false,
    "Reasoning": "No obstacles pose an immediate collision risk at t=0.9s. Obstacle 30633.0 needs further monitoring due to decreasing x-distance and potential lanelet merging."
