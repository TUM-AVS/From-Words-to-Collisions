At t=0.9s, Ego (30636.0) is in lanelet 321.0 at (161.8967, -294.6467) with a velocity of 5.3467 m/s.

Obstacle 30633.0 is in lanelet 1135.0 at (165.2989, -312.8963).  While the y-coordinates suggest some distance, the x-coordinates place it only about 3.4m ahead of the ego vehicle. Given the different lanelets and diverging trajectories based on previous timestamps, it's unlikely to be an immediate collision risk. This obstacle likely poses a medium risk at worst.

Obstacle 30634.0 is in the same lanelet 321.0 as Ego at (159.5545, -272.4999). This puts it roughly 2.3m behind Ego and traveling faster (8.9079 m/s).  This poses a potential risk as obstacle 30634 is approaching Ego rapidly from behind within the same lane.  However, there is still space and time for avoidance maneuvers, so this is likely a high (2) rather than extreme (1) risk.

Obstacle 30638.0 is in lanelet 1337.0 at (178.7082, -315.6195). This places it significantly further down the road and in a different lane, posing no immediate risk.

There are no imminent collisions or extreme risk obstacles identified at this timestep.
