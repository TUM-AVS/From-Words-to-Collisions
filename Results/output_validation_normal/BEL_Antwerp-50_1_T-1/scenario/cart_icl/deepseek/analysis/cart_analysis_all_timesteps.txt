### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep (0.9 seconds):

### Obstacle Analysis:
1. **Obstacle ID: 30633.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Located in lanelet 1135.0, while ego is in lanelet 321.0. The obstacle is moving away from the ego vehicle (increasing Y-coordinate difference). Distance is increasing over time.
   - **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: Relative velocity is low (ego is decelerating, obstacle is accelerating). TTC is high due to increasing distance.
   - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)

2. **Obstacle ID: 30634.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Located in the same lanelet (321.0) as ego. Distance is decreasing but still significant (~22.1472 units in Y-direction). Ego is decelerating, obstacle is maintaining speed.
   - **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: Relative velocity is low (~3.4392 units/s). TTC is high (~6.44 seconds).
   - **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low Risk)

3. **Obstacle ID: 30638.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Located in lanelet 1337.0, far from ego's lanelet (321.0). Distance is large (~38.8 units in X-direction, ~21.1 units in Y-direction).
   - **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: Moving away from ego (negative X-velocity). No collision risk.
   - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. **Obstacle 30633.0**: No risk (different lanelet, moving away).
2. **Obstacle 30634.0**: Same lanelet but safe distance and low relative velocity.
3. **Obstacle 30638.0**: Far away and moving away.
4. **Conclusion**: No collision or extreme risk obstacles.
