### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 30632.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is in a different lanelet and poses no immediate threat.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason:  Lateral velocity difference is significant; no risk of collision.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 30633.0
- Distance Risk reason: Although in a different lanelet initially, the obstacle's Y-coordinate suggests a potential lane change towards the ego vehicle's path, requiring monitoring.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: The obstacle is moving slower than the ego vehicle, but its continuous acceleration and potential lane change require careful observation.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3

- Obstacle ID: 30634.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is in the same lanelet and behind the ego vehicle. The distance is relatively safe but requires monitoring.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Obstacle has similar velocity and acceleration as ego, maintaining a safe following distance for now.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4


- Obstacle ID: 30635.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is in a different lanelet and poses no immediate threat.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Lateral velocity difference is significant; no risk of collision.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 30637.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is in the same lanelet and significantly ahead of the ego vehicle, posing no risk.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason:  Longitudinal velocity difference suggests increasing distance; no risk of collision.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 30638.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is in a different lanelet and its X-coordinate is significantly offset from the ego vehicle.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Lateral velocity difference is significant; no risk of collision.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4


### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
No obstacles have a risk score of 0, indicating no immediate collisions. Obstacle 30633.0 has a risk score of 3, requiring attention due to potential lane change and proximity. Other obstacles are assessed with scores of 4 or 5, indicating relatively low or negligible risk based on their trajectories and current behavior.  This is not a collision scenario.
