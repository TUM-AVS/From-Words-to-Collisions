### Obstacle Analysis at 0.9 Seconds:

#### Obstacle 30632
- **Distance Risk Reason**: The obstacle is consistently in a different lane from the ego vehicle and is moving away from the ego's trajectory. There has been no significant change in lateral proximity over recent timesteps.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 5
- **Time Risk Reason**: The obstacle is accelerating in a direction parallel to its initial movement and consistently distancing itself from the ego's trajectory, posing no immediate threat.
- **Time Safety Score**: 5
- **Overall Risk Score**: 5

#### Obstacle 30633
- **Distance Risk Reason**: The obstacle remains consistently ahead and is changing lanes. Minimal direct interference is expected, and its trajectory shows it is diverging from the ego vehicle's path.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 4
- **Time Risk Reason**: This obstacle has been accelerating, and while itâ€™s in a nearby lane, its trajectory is not converging with the ego vehicle. The velocity is moderate.
- **Time Safety Score**: 4
- **Overall Risk Score**: 4

#### Obstacle 30634
- **Distance Risk Reason**: While within the same lanelet, this obstacle has maintained a steady distance and speed. It is predicted to hold a parallel trajectory without convergence.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 4
- **Time Risk Reason**: Little deviation in speed and orientation; obstacles velocity and acceleration are stable, ensuring safe co-existence in the lanelet.
- **Time Safety Score**: 4
- **Overall Risk Score**: 4

#### Obstacle 30635
- **Distance Risk Reason**: The ego vehicle and this obstacle occupy different lanelets. Their paths have not converged significantly over the previous timesteps.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 5
- **Time Risk Reason**: Given its consistent speed and lack of alignment with the ego vehicle's trajectory, this obstacle presents no intersecting threat.
- **Time Safety Score**: 5
- **Overall Risk Score**: 5

#### Obstacle 30637
- **Distance Risk Reason**: Notable presence within the same lanelet as the ego vehicle but maintains a rearward position, moving parallel without intersection.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 4
- **Time Risk Reason**: The obstacle's moderate speeds and minor acceleration suggest no imminent collision risk toward the ego vehicle.
- **Time Safety Score**: 4
- **Overall Risk Score**: 4

#### Obstacle 30638
- **Distance Risk Reason**: Positioned far enough and in a different lanelet, moving in a path non-intersecting with the ego's current trajectory.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 5
- **Time Risk Reason**: The obstacle has been decelerating with negative acceleration trends, pulling it further from the ego's course.
- **Time Safety Score**: 5
- **Overall Risk Score**: 5

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
- The ego vehicle is predominantly in a lane where it doesn't intersect catastrophically with obstacles. Over the observed timeframes, none of the obstacles' trajectories intersect with the ego vehicle closely enough to warrant serious risk. The distances remain stable or increase relative to the ego.

### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
    "CollisionObstacles": [],
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null,
    "ScenarioAnalysis": {
        "IsCollisionScenario": false,
        "Reasoning": "All observed obstacles are maintaining or increasing their distance from the ego vehicle, with trajectory paths that do not indicate imminent intersecting risk within the given timeframe."
    }
}
```
The analysis indicates no imminent collision as all the current trajectories either run parallel or diverge from the ego vehicle's movement, with no obstacles presenting an extreme or collision risk.
