Obstacle 30633 is in front of the ego vehicle with a small longitudinal relative velocity (-0.33 m/s) and decreasing longitudinal distance. The lateral relative velocity is increasing and suggests a potential lateral movement of the obstacle, but the lateral distance remains 0. While not immediately a collision, the decreasing longitudinal distance and non-zero relative velocity warrants attention, placing it in a possible high-risk category.

Obstacle 30634 is behind the ego vehicle and poses no immediate risk. It shows increasing longitudinal relative velocity (3.56m/s), but the distance and motion suggest it's moving away from the ego vehicle.

Obstacle 30638, located front-left, exhibits concerning behavior. Although the absolute distances are relatively large (18.12m longitudinal, 12.90m lateral), both longitudinal and lateral relative velocities are significantly negative (-10.41 m/s and -7.64 m/s respectively), indicating it is rapidly approaching the ego vehicle. This, coupled with the prediction that it's moving towards the ego both longitudinally and laterally, signifies a potential high risk, warranting closer observation.
