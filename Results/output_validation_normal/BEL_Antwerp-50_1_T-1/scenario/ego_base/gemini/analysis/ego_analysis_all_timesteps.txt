At t=0.9s, Obstacle 30633 is in front of the ego car, approaching longitudinally with a small relative velocity (-0.33 m/s) and a lateral velocity of 2.32 m/s.  The lateral movement suggests a potential lane change or drift by Obstacle 30633 towards the ego vehicle. The longitudinal distance is 14.00m. This obstacle poses a potential risk, although not immediate.

Obstacle 30634 is behind the ego car, approaching with a relative longitudinal velocity of 3.56 m/s. The longitudinal distance is -17.76m. This obstacle is not an immediate threat.

Obstacle 30638 is front-left of the ego car, approaching both longitudinally (-10.41 m/s) and laterally (-7.64 m/s). The distances are 18.12m longitudinal and 12.90m lateral.  This obstacle is closing in rapidly and requires attention. However, given the distances and relative velocities, a collision isn't imminent in the next timestep. This poses a high risk.
