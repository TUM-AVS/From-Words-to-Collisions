### Safety analysis for timestep 0.9 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

It's important to note that the provided scenario information lacks ego vehicle dimensions and therefore, it's impossible to calculate adjusted distances (adjusted_d_long and adjusted_d_lat).  The analysis will proceed using the provided real distances (DTClong and DTClat), acknowledging that the results may not fully represent real-world risk.  Also, the scenario provides no information on lateral positioning other than "Front," "Front-Left," or "Behind." Without lateral position information, true TTC and MDC cannot be accurately calculated. The following estimations assume the obstacles' lateral movement will not result in a collision.


### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID:** 30633
- **Distance Risk reason:**  Obstacle is in front and approaching the ego vehicle longitudinally (DTClong decreasing). The lateral distance is also decreasing, suggesting a possible converging trajectory (DTClat decreasing).  Distance is moderately close (14.00m longitudinal and lateral).
- **Distance safety score:** 3 (Medium Risk)
- **Time Risk reason:** Without accurate lateral information, TTC cannot be reliably calculated.  Longitudinally, the obstacle is closing slowly (-0.33 m/s), but relative acceleration is positive, meaning the closing rate is decreasing.
- **Time safety score:** 3 (Medium Risk)
- **Overall Risk score:** 3 (Medium Risk)

- **Obstacle ID:** 30634
- **Distance Risk reason:** Obstacle is behind the ego vehicle and DTClong is increasing negatively meaning it is getting further away from the ego vehicle (-17.76m). It appears to be moving closer laterally, but without precise lateral data, it's unclear if this poses a risk.
- **Distance safety score:** 4 (Low Risk)
- **Time Risk reason:**  The obstacle is moving away longitudinally, so the TTC longitudinally is high.  Lateral movement is unclear.
- **Time safety score:** 4 (Low Risk)
- **Overall Risk score:** 4 (Low Risk)


- **Obstacle ID:** 30638
- **Distance Risk reason:** Obstacle is in front and to the left of the ego vehicle and approaching relatively quickly (DTClong and DTClat decreasing, both at 18.12m).  This represents a potential risk.
- **Distance safety score:** 3 (Medium Risk)
- **Time Risk reason:**  Obstacle has significant negative longitudinal and lateral closing velocities (-10.41 m/s and -7.64 m/s respectively). While longitudinal acceleration is positive, the velocities indicate a concerning closing rate.  Accurate TTC without lateral positioning is impossible.
- **Time safety score:** 2 (High Risk)
- **Overall Risk score:** 2 (High Risk)
