* **Obstacle 30633 (Front):** This obstacle is directly in front of the ego vehicle and has maintained a near-zero lateral distance over all timesteps.  The longitudinal distance is decreasing, but relatively slowly.  The relative longitudinal velocity is negative but increasing towards zero, indicating the closing speed is slowly decreasing.  Let's analyze the most recent timestep (0.9s):

    * Longitudinal distance: 14.00m
    * Longitudinal relative velocity: -0.33 m/s (approaching)
    * TTC (longitudinal): 14.00m / 0.33 m/s ≈ 42.4s
    * MDC: Effectively the lateral distance, which is 0.00m. This represents a potential collision point, though not a collision itself.
    * Longitudinal Risk: No Risk (5) based on TTC. However, lateral alignment means constant observation is required.
    * Lateral Risk: Medium Risk (3) because sustained zero lateral distance requires close monitoring.

    * Overall Risk: Medium Risk (3) - While TTC is high, the persistent lateral alignment requires caution.

* **Obstacle 30634 (Behind):**  This obstacle is directly behind the ego vehicle and maintains a near-zero lateral distance. The longitudinal distance is decreasing, meaning the obstacle is approaching the ego vehicle.  Analyzing the most recent timestep (0.9s):

    * Longitudinal distance: -17.76m
    * Longitudinal relative velocity: 3.56 m/s (approaching)
    * TTC (longitudinal): 17.76m / 3.56 m/s ≈ 5.0s
    * MDC: Effectively the lateral distance which is 0.00m. The alignment means ongoing monitoring is needed.
    * Longitudinal Risk: Low Risk (4) based on TTC.
    * Lateral Risk: Medium Risk (3) due to persistent lateral alignment, which requires observation.

    * Overall Risk: Low Risk (4)  - While TTC suggests low risk, the constant lateral alignment necessitates caution.


* **Obstacle 30638 (Front-Left):**  This obstacle is approaching the ego vehicle from the front-left. Both longitudinal and lateral distances are decreasing. Analysis at 0.9s:

    * Longitudinal distance: 18.12m
    * Lateral Distance: 12.90m
    * Longitudinal relative velocity: -10.41 m/s
    * Lateral relative velocity: -7.64 m/s
    * TTC (longitudinal): 18.12m / 10.41 m/s ≈ 1.7s
    * TTC (lateral): 12.90m / 7.64 m/s ≈ 1.7s
    * MDC: Requires more information to calculate accurately but is likely >5 based on current and projected distance.
    * Longitudinal Risk: Medium Risk (3)
    * Lateral Risk: No Risk (5)

    * Overall Risk: Medium Risk (3) -  TTC suggests potential risk.

**Collision Scenario Determination:**  No obstacle has a risk score of 0 (collision) or 1 (extreme risk).  Therefore, this is NOT a collision scenario.
