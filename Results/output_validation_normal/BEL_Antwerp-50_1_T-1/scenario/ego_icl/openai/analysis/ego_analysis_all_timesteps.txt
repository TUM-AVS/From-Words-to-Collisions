### Obstacle-by-Obstacle Analysis

#### Obstacle 30633 (Front)
- **Trajectory Analysis**: Moving toward the ego vehicle from the front, with decreasing longitudinal distance and exact lateral alignment.
- **Most Recent Adjusted Distances** (at 0.9s): Longitudinal 14.00m, Lateral 0.00m.
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal -0.33 m/s
  - **TTC Calculation**: 
    - Longitudinal TTC = 14.00 / |-0.33| ≈ 42.42 seconds (approaching slowly)
    - Lateral movement away does not factor into a forward collision in terms of alignment.
  - **MDC**: 0.00 meters (as lateral alignment is perfect)
- **Risk Assessment**:
  - MDC indicates high-risk due to lateral alignment, but longitudinally the TTC suggests monitoring.
  - Final score: **Medium Risk (3)** because trajectories are not converging rapidly.

#### Obstacle 30634 (Behind)
- **Trajectory Analysis**: Approaching from behind, with increasing velocity indicating it is slowly catching up.
- **Most Recent Adjusted Distances** (at 0.9s): Longitudinal -17.76m, Lateral 0.00m.
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal 3.56 m/s
  - **TTC Calculation**:
     - Longitudinal TTC = |-17.76| / 3.56 ≈ 4.99 seconds (approaching slowly)
  - **MDC**: 17.76 meters (adjusted)
- **Risk Assessment**:
  - TTC near 5 seconds suggests low risk.
  - Final score: **Low Risk (4)** as approach is gradual.

#### Obstacle 30638 (Front-Left)
- **Trajectory Analysis**: From the front-left, moving both longitudinally and laterally towards the ego vehicle.
- **Most Recent Adjusted Distances** (at 0.9s): Longitudinal 18.12m, Lateral 12.90m.
- **Relative Velocities**: Longitudinal -10.41 m/s, Lateral -7.64 m/s
  - **TTC Calculation**:
    - Longitudinal TTC = 18.12 / |-10.41| ≈ 1.74 seconds
    - Lateral TTC = 12.90 / |-7.64| ≈ 1.69 seconds
  - **MDC**: Given paths are converging -> MDC < 1.0m due to trajectories.
- **Risk Assessment**:
  - Both longitudinal and lateral TTCs are short; trajectories converge in less than 2 seconds.
  - Final score: **High Risk (2)** due to rapid approach in both dimensions.

### Collision Scenario Determination
- **CollisionObstacle**: None at collision level (0)
- **ExtremeRiskObstacle**: None at extreme risk level (1)
- **High Risk**: Obstacle 30638 poses high risk due to converging trajectories from front-left, mostly because of low TTCs.
- **Medium Risk**: Obstacle 30633 due to alignment, but moderated by low relative velocity
- **Low Risk**: Obstacle 30634 due to slow approach speed from behind

This is **not a collision scenario** as no obstacle scores 0 or 1, but it flags significant caution needed, especially with Obstacle 30638's trajectory.

    "Justification": "No obstacle reaches extreme risk level. Highest risk from Obstacle 30638 is high due to converging trajectories, but not imminent collision."
