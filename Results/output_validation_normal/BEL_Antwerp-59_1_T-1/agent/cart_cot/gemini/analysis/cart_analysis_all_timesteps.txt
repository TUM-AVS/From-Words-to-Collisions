Here's the collision risk analysis for the provided scenario at t=0.9s:

**Ego Vehicle State:**

* Position: (-365.9145, -358.4604)
* Orientation: -0.7945963271087896 rad
* Velocity: 2.8271 m/s
* Acceleration: 1.358 m/sÂ²

**Obstacles Analysis at t=0.9s:**

* **Obstacle 30494:**
    * Position: (-355.2684, -344.0861)
    * Velocity: 8.0004 m/s
    * Distance to Ego: ~25.2 meters
    * TTC: Approaching 3 seconds if velocities remain constant. Obstacle is moving faster than the ego vehicle.
    * Risk Assessment: Medium (3). Although the obstacle is at a safe distance currently and no immediate collision risk is apparent, the relatively high speed and the predicted trajectory require attention.


* **Obstacle 30498:**
    * Position: (-374.5381, -355.9675)
    * Velocity: 3.4532 m/s
    * Distance to Ego: ~9.3 meters
    * TTC: Approaching 3 seconds if velocities remain constant. Lateral separation needs continuous monitoring. 
    * Risk Assessment: Medium (3). The distance is somewhat close, but the moderate speeds of both vehicles suggests adequate time to react if necessary.


* **Obstacle 30499:**
    * Position: (-364.8879, -377.7656)
    * Velocity: 14.1629 m/s
    * Distance to Ego: ~19.4 meters
    * TTC: Approaching 1.3 seconds if velocities remain constant. This obstacle poses the most significant immediate risk due to its high velocity.
    * Risk Assessment: High (2).  Close proximity combined with high speed warrants quick evasive action by the ego vehicle.


* **Obstacle 30500:**
    * Position: (-383.8472, -354.2438)
    * Velocity: 2.3199 m/s
    * Distance to Ego: ~19.7 meters
    * TTC: Relatively safe if velocities remain constant.
    * Risk Assessment: Medium (3). Moderate distance and speed present a manageable risk.


* **Obstacle 30502:**
    * Position: (-392.5804, -352.4626)
    * Velocity: 1.5558 m/s
    * Distance to Ego: ~28.8 meters
    * TTC: Safe, assuming constant velocities.
    * Risk Assessment: Low (4). Distance and speeds suggest minimal risk.


* **Obstacle 30503:**
    * Position: (-369.1446, -379.832)
    * Velocity: 7.4905 m/s
    * Distance to Ego: ~22.3 meters
    * TTC: Approaching 3 seconds if velocities remain constant.
    * Risk Assessment: Medium (3).  The high speed needs monitoring, but currently not a severe threat.
