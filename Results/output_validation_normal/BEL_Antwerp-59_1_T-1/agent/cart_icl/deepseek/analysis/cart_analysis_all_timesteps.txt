### Analysis of the Scenario:

1. **Obstacle 30499 (at 0.9s):**
   - **Position**: (-364.8879, -377.7656)  
   - **Velocity**: 14.1629 m/s (high speed, moving towards ego's lanelet 125.0)  
   - **Relative Motion**: The obstacle is moving rapidly towards the ego's vicinity (lanelet 125.0 is adjacent to ego's lanelet 980.0).  
   - **TTC**: Estimated TTC is very low due to high relative velocity and proximity.  
   - **Risk**: **Extreme Risk (1)** - Immediate collision likely if trajectories intersect.

2. **Obstacle 30503 (at 0.9s):**
   - **Position**: (-369.1446, -379.832)  
   - **Velocity**: 7.4905 m/s (moving towards ego's lanelet 126.0)  
   - **Relative Motion**: The obstacle is in lanelet 126.0, which is adjacent to ego's lanelet 980.0. The lateral distance is decreasing.  
   - **TTC**: Moderate but closing fast.  
   - **Risk**: **High Risk (2)** - Close to collision, needs quick action.

3. **Obstacle 30494 (at 0.9s):**
   - **Position**: (-355.2684, -344.0861)  
   - **Velocity**: 8.0004 m/s (moving away from ego's lanelet 122.0)  
   - **Relative Motion**: The obstacle is in a different lanelet (122.0) and moving away.  
   - **Risk**: **Low Risk (4)** - Minimal risk, sufficient time to react.

4. **Obstacle 30498 (at 0.9s):**
   - **Position**: (-374.5381, -355.9675)  
   - **Velocity**: 3.4532 m/s (moving in lanelet 111.0, away from ego)  
   - **Relative Motion**: The obstacle is in a different lanelet (111.0) and moving away.  
   - **Risk**: **Negligible Risk (5)** - No significant risk.

5. **Obstacle 30500 (at 0.9s):**
   - **Position**: (-383.8472, -354.2438)  
   - **Velocity**: 2.3199 m/s (moving in lanelet 111.0, away from ego)  
   - **Relative Motion**: The obstacle is in a different lanelet (111.0) and moving away.  
   - **Risk**: **Negligible Risk (5)** - No significant risk.

6. **Obstacle 30502 (at 0.9s):**
   - **Position**: (-392.5804, -352.4626)  
   - **Velocity**: 1.5558 m/s (moving in lanelet 111.0, away from ego)  
   - **Relative Motion**: The obstacle is in a different lanelet (111.0) and moving away.  
   - **Risk**: **Negligible Risk (5)** - No significant risk.
