At t=0.9s, the ego vehicle at (-365.91, -358.46) is analyzed against the following obstacles:

* **Obstacle 30494:** Located at (-355.27, -344.09), this obstacle poses a low risk.  It's moving faster than the ego vehicle and located diagonally behind in a different lanelet.  Although the distance is not extremely large, the different trajectories suggest a low probability of conflict.  A safe score of 4 is assigned.

* **Obstacle 30498:** Located at (-374.54, -355.97), this obstacle is behind and slightly to the left of the ego vehicle in a different lanelet and it is moving slower than the ego vehicle.  Therefore there is no immediate risk, resulting in a score of 5.

* **Obstacle 30499:** Located at (-364.89, -377.77), this obstacle is situated significantly south of the ego vehicle, and its motion suggests it's moving even further south in a different lanelet. This poses no immediate threat, so a score of 5 is given.

* **Obstacle 30500:** Located at (-383.85, -354.24) and moving west and slower than the ego vehicle, this obstacle is behind and slightly to the left of the ego. It does not pose any immediate risk and is assigned a score of 5.

* **Obstacle 30502:** Located at (-392.58, -352.46), this obstacle is far west of the ego and poses no immediate threat. Its trajectory isn't intersecting with the ego's path in the near future. It receives a score of 5.

* **Obstacle 30503:** At (-369.14, -379.83), this obstacle is located diagonally behind and to the left of the ego vehicle in a different lanelet. The trajectories suggest no immediate danger. Thus, a score of 4 is given.
