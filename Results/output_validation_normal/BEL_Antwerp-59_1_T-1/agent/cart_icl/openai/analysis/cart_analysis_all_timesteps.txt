To provide an accurate analysis, I will examine each obstacle's potential risk to the ego vehicle at the most recent timestamp (0.9 seconds).

**At 0.9 seconds:**

### Obstacle 30494:
- **Position**: (-355.2684, -344.0861)
- **Relative Position to Ego**: Approximately 13.8m away laterally and approximately 14.37m longitudinally
- **Velocity**: 8.0004
- The obstacle is moving with a higher velocity, but given the distance across lanes (different lanelets), there is negligible immediate risk.

### Obstacle 30498:
- **Position**: (-374.5381, -355.9675)
- **Relative Position to Ego**: Approximately 8.42m away laterally and approximately 17.08m longitudinally
- **Velocity**: 3.4532
- This obstacle is relatively behind the ego and moving towards it in a different lanelet, but their positions indicate no immediate risk.

### Obstacle 30499:
- **Position**: (-364.8879, -377.7656)
- **Relative Position to Ego**: Approximately 19.75m away laterally and close longitudinally (front and slightly below)
- **Velocity**: 14.1629 (decreasing)
- This obstacle is in a different lanelet and is lateral to the ego vehicle. Despite its higher velocity, it is not a collision threat due to lane separation.

### Obstacle 30500:
- **Position**: (-383.8472, -354.2438)
- **Relative Position to Ego**: Approximately 22.93m away laterally and approximately 17.38m longitudinally
- **Velocity**: 2.3199
- This obstacle is not on a collision course, given the distance and lanelet separation.

### Obstacle 30502:
- **Position**: (-392.5804, -352.4626)
- **Relative Position to Ego**: Approximately 27.21m away laterally and approximately 35.67m longitudinally
- **Velocity**: 1.5558
- Its position is at a safe distance, given its path, and on a different lanelet.

### Obstacle 30503:
- **Position**: (-369.1446, -379.832)
- **Relative Position to Ego**: Approximately 21.38m away laterally and approximately 0.97m longitudinally
- **Velocity**: 7.4905
- This obstacle is approaching from behind but is lateral and on a different lanelet. Still, it is the closest in proximity to the ego vehicle, moving at a high speed, necessitating careful monitoring.

### Key Observations:
- **Most risky**: Obstacle 30503 due to its high approaching speed. However, because of the separate paths (lanelet differences), there isnâ€™t immediate extreme risk.
- **All other obstacles** seem to carry negligible immediate risk given the lanelet differences and distances.
  
### Conclusion
From the data provided, there are no collisions or extreme risk situations based on position, velocity differential, and lanelet separation.
