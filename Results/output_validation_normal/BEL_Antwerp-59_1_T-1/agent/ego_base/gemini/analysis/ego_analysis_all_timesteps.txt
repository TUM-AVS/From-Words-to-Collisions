At t=0.9s, Obstacle 30494 is alongside the ego vehicle (lateral distance 16.06m) but moving away laterally, posing negligible risk. Obstacle 30498 is behind the ego vehicle and slightly to the right, moving away longitudinally but towards the ego car laterally. While relatively close (-3.31m longitudinal, -2.80m lateral), its low longitudinal velocity (0.0 m/s) suggests it's not an immediate threat. Obstacle 30499, despite its decreasing longitudinal distance (9.99m) and high closing velocity (-9.71 m/s), is moving away laterally (albeit slowly), so it's not an immediate collision risk. Obstacles 30500 and 30502 are behind and to the right, moving away longitudinally and thus not immediate risks. Finally, Obstacle 30503 is moving away both longitudinally and laterally, posing no risk. Therefore, no obstacle presents an extreme or high risk of collision.
