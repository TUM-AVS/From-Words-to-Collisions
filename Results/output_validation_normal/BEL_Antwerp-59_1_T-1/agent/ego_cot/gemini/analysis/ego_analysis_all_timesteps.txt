### Safety analysis for timestep 0.9s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

**Assumptions and Clarifications:**

* Since adjusted distances (adjusted_d_long, adjusted_d_lat) are not provided in the scenario description, the provided real distances (DTClong, DTClat) will be used for analysis.  This is not ideal and may lead to less accurate risk assessments.  It is *strongly* recommended to include adjusted distances in future scenario descriptions for a more robust analysis.
*  TTC will be approximated using distance and relative velocity: TTC = Distance / Relative Velocity.  This is a simplification. More sophisticated TTC calculations consider acceleration and other factors.
*  A negative TTC value indicates that the obstacle is moving away from the ego vehicle in that direction (longitudinally or laterally).
* It is crucial to understand that the provided scenario context does not explicitly state the size and shape of the ego vehicle and other obstacles.  This makes true risk assessment difficult.

### Obstacle Analysis:

**- Obstacle ID: 30494**
- Distance Risk reason:  The obstacle is in the Left of the ego car. The real distance is longitudinal 0.00 m and lateral 0.00 m, indicating a very high risk of collision.
- Distance safety score: 0
- Time Risk reason: The longitudinal relative velocity is negative, but lateral velocity is positive meaning obstacle is driving toward ego vehicle from the left side, combined with the zero distance, resulting in a very high risk.
- Time safety score: 0
- Overall Risk score: 0

**- Obstacle ID: 30498**
- Distance Risk reason: The obstacle is in the Rear-right of the ego car with a longitudinal distance of -3.31 m and a lateral distance of -3.31 m.  This implies some proximity.
- Distance safety score: 2
- Time Risk reason:  While moving away longitudinally, the obstacle is moving closer laterally.
- Time safety score: 2
- Overall Risk score: 2

**- Obstacle ID: 30499**
- Distance Risk reason: Located at 9.99m longitudinally and laterally from the ego car in the front-right direction.  This offers a reasonable safety margin.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason:  Although the distance is substantial, the obstacle is approaching both longitudinally and laterally. The high magnitudes of the relative velocity necessitate continuous monitoring.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3

**- Obstacle ID: 30500**
- Distance Risk reason:  Positioned at -11.06 m longitudinally and laterally in the Rear-right of the ego car, indicating considerable distance.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Moving further away longitudinally, but getting closer laterally. The relative speeds suggest enough time to react.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

**- Obstacle ID: 30502**
- Distance Risk reason:  Considerable distance at -18.45 m longitudinally and laterally in the Rear-right of the ego car.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Moving further away longitudinally, but getting closer laterally. The low relative speeds imply ample time to react.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

**- Obstacle ID: 30503**
- Distance Risk reason: Located at 8.48 m longitudinally and laterally in the Front-right of the ego car, indicating a safe distance.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: While moving away laterally, the obstacle is approaching longitudinally.  The low relative speeds and substantial distance reduce the immediate risk.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4
