At t=0.9s:

* **Obstacle 30494 (Left):** Lateral distance is 16.06m, longitudinal 0m, and lateral velocity is moving away from ego (6.91 m/s).  Longitudinal velocity (-6.85m/s indicates motion is somewhat toward the ego vehicle because obstacle passed ego vehicle, but the obstacle is already in the left of the ego, so there is no risk of collision. Although it shows exact longitudinal alignment, lateral motion is diverging. Risk: Negligible (5).

* **Obstacle 30498 (Rear-right):** Longitudinal distance is -3.31m, lateral -2.80m. Longitudinal velocity is -0.00 m/s, lateral velocity is 1.99 m/s. Although the longitudinal velocity is 0 and the motion description says that the obstacle is moving away longitudinally, the small negative longitudinal distance indicates the obstacle is very close behind the ego vehicle. The lateral distance is also small and negative, and the lateral velocity indicates the obstacle is moving towards the ego vehicle laterally. Combining these factors suggests an increasing risk. MDC ≈ 3m, TTC not applicable for longitudinal since relative velocity ≈ 0 but lateral TTC ≈ 1.4s, suggests a Medium Risk. Overall Risk: Medium (3).

* **Obstacle 30499 (Front-right):** Longitudinal distance is 9.99m, lateral -11.18m. Longitudinal velocity is -9.71 m/s, lateral velocity is 12.38 m/s.  Both longitudinal and lateral velocities show approach, but distances are relatively large. Longitudinal TTC ≈ 1.0s, Lateral TTC ≈ 0.9s. MDC ≈ 10m, TTC suggests high risk while MDC suggests a lower risk. Because we prioritize high risk, therefore, Overall Risk: High (2).

* **Obstacle 30500 (Rear-right):** Longitudinal distance is -11.06m, lateral -8.23m, longitudinal velocity is -0.92 m/s (moving away), and lateral velocity is 1.33 m/s (approaching). The obstacle is behind and to the right of the ego vehicle, with relatively large distances. Lateral TTC ≈ 6.1s. MDC ≈ 13m, TTC suggests no risk while MDC suggests a low risk. Because we prioritize low risk, Overall Risk: Low (4).

* **Obstacle 30502 (Rear-right):** Longitudinal distance is -18.45m, lateral -13.22m, longitudinal velocity is -1.52 m/s (moving away), and lateral velocity is 0.85 m/s (approaching). The obstacle is relatively far behind and to the right. Lateral TTC ≈ 15.5s. MDC ≈ 22.5m, TTC suggests no risk while MDC suggests no risk. Overall Risk: Negligible (5).

* **Obstacle 30503 (Front-right):** Longitudinal distance is 8.48m, lateral -15.67m, longitudinal velocity is 0.81 m/s (moving away), lateral velocity is -6.55 m/s (moving away). Both are moving away and are at safe distance. Longitudinal TTC isn't applicable and lateral TTC isn't applicable.  MDC ≈ 17.8m, TTC and MDC suggests no risk. Overall Risk: Negligible (5).
