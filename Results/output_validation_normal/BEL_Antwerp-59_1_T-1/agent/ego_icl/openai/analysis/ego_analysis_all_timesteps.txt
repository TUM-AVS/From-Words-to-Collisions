## Obstacle-by-Obstacle Analysis and Trajectory Assessment

### Obstacle 30494

**Trajectory Analysis:**
- Positions moved from Front-left towards Left over timesteps.
- Longitudinal distance decreased consistently, indicating possible convergence.
- Lateral distance increased significantly, suggesting the obstacle is turning away laterally.

**At 0.9 seconds:**
- Adjusted Longitudinal Distance: 0.00 m
- Adjusted Lateral Distance: 16.06 m
- Relative Longitudinal Velocity: -6.85 m/s (approaching)
- Relative Lateral Velocity: 6.91 m/s (moving away)
  
**TTC and MDC Analysis:**
- Longitudinal alignment occurred, meaning a high risk of longitudinal closeness.
- TTC (longitudinal) = 0.00 m / |-6.85 m/s| = 0s (which implies immediate intersection if there wasn't lateral separation)
- With significant lateral distance and moving further away laterally, the current risk is moderated by large lateral clearance.
  
**Risk Assessment:**
- Overall, the longitudinal zero distance and converging longitudinal velocity imply an Extreme Risk due to chance of misalignment correction leading to collision.

### Obstacle 30498

**Trajectory Analysis:**
- Continuously maintained Rear-right position, moving slightly.
- Longitudinal and lateral distances fluctuating but within a consistent lower magnitude range.

**At 0.9 seconds:**
- Adjusted Longitudinal Distance: -3.31 m
- Adjusted Lateral Distance: -2.80 m
- Relative Longitudinal Velocity: 0.00 m/s
- Relative Lateral Velocity: 1.99 m/s (approaching laterally)
  
**TTC and MDC Analysis:**
- Longitudinally steady with minimal movement, indicating lateral approach.
- TTC (lateral) = 2.80 m / |1.99 m/s| ≈ 1.41 seconds
- MDC would indicate no immediate risk as it lacks a closing trajectory on the longitudinal axis.
  
**Risk Assessment:**
- Stable enough longitudinally, though lateral approach could become significant. Medium Risk.

### Obstacle 30499

**Trajectory Analysis:**
- Shifts from Front-right position, adjusting closer longitudinally while varying laterally.
- Consistent closing velocity towards the ego vehicle.

**At 0.9 seconds:**
- Adjusted Longitudinal Distance: 9.99 m
- Adjusted Lateral Distance: -11.18 m
- Relative Longitudinal Velocity: -9.71 m/s (approaching)
- Relative Lateral Velocity: 12.38 m/s (closing in)

**TTC and MDC Analysis:**
- TTC (longitudinal) = 9.99 m / |-9.71 m/s| ≈ 1.03 seconds
- TTC (lateral) is not significant at such a high lateral closing velocity and initial separation.
- High Risk due to rapid longitudinal closure with potential lateral intersection.

### Obstacle 30500

**Trajectory Analysis:**
- Maintains Rear-right position with steady adjustment.
- Mainly poses a lateral approach risk due to trajectory.

**At 0.9 seconds:**
- Adjusted Longitudinal Distance: -11.06 m
- Adjusted Lateral Distance: -8.23 m
- Relative Longitudinal Velocity: -0.92 m/s
- Relative Lateral Velocity: 1.33 m/s

**TTC and MDC Analysis:**
- Consistent distancing with minor lateral shift towards the ego vehicle.
- Neither dimension suggests immediate collision threat.
  
**Risk Assessment:**
- Low Risk, with significant buffer zones and movement variability unlikely leading to collision.

### Obstacle 30502

**Trajectory Analysis:**
- Continues heavily in the Rear-right zone.
- Minimal longitudinal and lateral coordination observable.

**At 0.9 seconds:**
- Adjusted Longitudinal Distance: -18.45 m
- Adjusted Lateral Distance: -13.22 m
- Relative Longitudinal Velocity: -1.52 m/s
- Relative Lateral Velocity: 0.85 m/s

**TTC and MDC Analysis:**
- TTC values non-critical due to large separation distances and moderate velocities.
  
**Risk Assessment:**
- Negligible, with no significant risk indicators where convergence is possible soon.

### Obstacle 30503

**Trajectory Analysis:**
- Attempts to maintain Front-right quadrant consistently over time.
- Adjusts distally both longitudinally and laterally.
  
**At 0.9 seconds:**
- Adjusted Longitudinal Distance: 8.48 m
- Adjusted Lateral Distance: -15.67 m
- Relative Longitudinal Velocity: 0.81 m/s (approaching)
- Relative Lateral Velocity: -6.55 m/s (moving away)

**TTC and MDC Analysis:**
- All factors indicate non-threatening movement, with diverging movements.
  
**Risk Assessment:**
- Negligible Risk, with large separation and velocities consistent with safety.
