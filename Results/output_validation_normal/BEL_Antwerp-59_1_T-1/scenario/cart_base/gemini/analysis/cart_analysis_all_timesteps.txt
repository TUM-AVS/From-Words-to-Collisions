Obstacle 30499 is showing a concerning trajectory. It's located in lanelet 125 and moving at a high velocity (14.16 m/s) towards the ego vehicle's general vicinity, while the ego vehicle is in lanelet 980. While not an immediate collision at this timestep (0.9s), the high speed of obstacle 30499 combined with the relative positions warrants classifying it as an extreme risk, as a slight deviation in either vehicle's trajectory could lead to a collision in the next few timesteps.  Other obstacles are not presenting an immediate collision risk at this timestep.
