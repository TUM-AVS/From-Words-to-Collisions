### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep (0.9 seconds):

### Obstacle Analysis:

1. **Obstacle ID: 30494.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Moving away from ego in the positive X direction (increasing distance). Current distance: ~10.65m.
   - **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: High velocity (8.0 m/s) but moving away. No immediate threat.
   - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 5

2. **Obstacle ID: 30498.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Moving towards ego but still ~9.38m away in negative X direction.
   - **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: Moderate velocity (3.45 m/s) with increasing acceleration. Needs monitoring.
   - **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 4

3. **Obstacle ID: 30499.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Rapidly approaching from behind (Y direction), distance ~19.3m but closing fast.
   - **Distance safety score**: 2 (High Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: Very high velocity (14.16 m/s) with deceleration, but still closing fast.
   - **Time safety score**: 2 (High Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 2

4. **Obstacle ID: 30500.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Moving away in negative X direction (~17.93m away).
   - **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: Low velocity (2.32 m/s) moving away.
   - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 5

5. **Obstacle ID: 30502.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Far away (~26.67m) in negative X direction.
   - **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: Low velocity (1.56 m/s) moving away.
   - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 5

6. **Obstacle ID: 30503.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Moving perpendicular to ego in Y direction (~21.37m away).
   - **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: High velocity (7.49 m/s) but not directly towards ego.
   - **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 4

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. No obstacles are in immediate collision path (risk score 0).
2. Obstacle 30499.0 is the highest risk (score 2) due to rapid approach from behind.
3. Other obstacles are either moving away or at safe distances.
4. Ego vehicle is decelerating, which helps mitigate risks.
5. Scenario is not currently a collision scenario but requires monitoring of obstacle 30499.0.
