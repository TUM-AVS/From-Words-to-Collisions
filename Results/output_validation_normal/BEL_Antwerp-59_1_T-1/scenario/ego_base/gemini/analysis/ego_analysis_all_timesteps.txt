At t=0.9s, Obstacle 30494 is directly beside the ego vehicle (lateral distance of 16.06m and longitudinal distance 0.0m) and moving away laterally. There are no immediate collisions. However, obstacle 30499 is approaching the ego vehicle longitudinally at -9.71 m/s with a longitudinal distance of 9.99m.  While it's also moving laterally towards the ego vehicle at 12.38 m/s, the lateral distance of 11.18m suggests this obstacle may pose a high risk in the near future. Obstacles 30500 and 30502 are moving away longitudinally and do not pose an immediate threat, and obstacle 30503 is moving away longitudinally.
