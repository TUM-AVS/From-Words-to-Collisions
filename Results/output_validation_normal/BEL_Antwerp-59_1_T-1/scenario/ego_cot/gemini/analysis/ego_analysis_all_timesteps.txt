### Safety analysis for timestep 0.9 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

**Assumptions and Clarifications:**

* The prompt mentions "adjusted distances" (adjusted_d_long and adjusted_d_lat), but these values are not provided in the scenario context.  Therefore, I will use the given real distances (DTClong, DTClat) for my analysis.  This may impact the accuracy of the risk assessment.
* I will infer TTC based on the provided distance and velocity information.  A precise TTC calculation requires a model of future behavior, which is not available here. I will assume constant velocity for a very short horizon for the TTC estimation.
* A collision is assumed when the distance in either longitudinal or lateral direction is effectively zero.

### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 30494**
- Distance Risk reason:  Almost overlapping with the ego vehicle (0.0m longitudinal and lateral distance).  Located to the left.
- Distance safety score: 0
- Time Risk reason: Based on the previous timesteps, this obstacle has been consistently approaching the ego vehicle. Although lateral motion suggests it *might* just barely avoid a direct collision, the longitudinal velocity indicates very high risk.
- Time safety score: 1
- Overall Risk score: 0 (Collision imminent)

- **Obstacle ID: 30498**
- Distance Risk reason: Relatively close behind the ego vehicle (-3.31m longitudinal, -3.31m lateral).
- Distance safety score: 2
- Time Risk reason:  Longitudinal velocity is almost zero, suggesting a possible stationary state relative to the ego vehicle, but the lateral motion indicates increasing risk.
- Time safety score: 2
- Overall Risk score: 2 (High Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 30499**
- Distance Risk reason:  Relatively far from the ego vehicle at this timestep (9.99m longitudinal and lateral). Located front-right.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Closing velocity is high in both longitudinal and lateral directions. The current distance provides some buffer, but the trajectory suggests a potential future collision.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3 (Medium risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 30500**
- Distance Risk reason:  Reasonably far behind and to the right of the ego vehicle (-11.06m longitudinal, -11.06m lateral).
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason:  Moving away longitudinally but closing laterally.  The current distance and velocities suggest no immediate danger.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4 (Low risk)


- **Obstacle ID: 30502**
- Distance Risk reason: Far behind and to the right of the ego vehicle (-18.45m longitudinal, -18.45m lateral).
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Moving further away longitudinally but closing laterally, but the distance and velocities suggest no imminent danger.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5 (Negligible risk)


- **Obstacle ID: 30503**
- Distance Risk reason:  Reasonably far from the ego vehicle (8.48m longitudinal and lateral). Located to the front-right.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Moving away longitudinally, and the lateral motion poses no immediate threat given the current distance and lateral velocity.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4 (Low Risk)
