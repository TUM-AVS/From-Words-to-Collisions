Let me analyze the most recent timestep (0.9 seconds) for collision risks:

**Obstacle 30494 (Left):**
- Adjusted distance: longitudinal 0.00m, lateral 16.06m
- Relative velocity: longitudinal -6.85 m/s (approaching), lateral 6.91 m/s (moving away)
- Motion: Exact longitudinal alignment, moving away laterally
- Analysis: 
  - Longitudinal TTC = 0.00/6.85 = 0s (but lateral distance increasing)
  - MDC = lateral distance = 16.06m (no collision path)
- Risk: 5 (No Risk) - despite longitudinal alignment, lateral distance is large and increasing

**Obstacle 30498 (Rear-right):**
- Adjusted distance: longitudinal -3.31m, lateral -2.80m
- Relative velocity: longitudinal 0.00 m/s, lateral 1.99 m/s (approaching)
- Motion: Moving away longitudinally, approaching laterally
- Analysis:
  - Lateral TTC = 2.80/1.99 = 1.41s
  - MDC = longitudinal distance = 3.31m
- Risk: 3 (Medium Risk) - moderate lateral approach but safe longitudinal distance

**Obstacle 30499 (Front-right):**
- Adjusted distance: longitudinal 9.99m, lateral -11.18m
- Relative velocity: longitudinal -9.71 m/s (approaching), lateral 12.38 m/s (approaching)
- Motion: Approaching in both dimensions
- Analysis:
  - Longitudinal TTC = 9.99/9.71 = 1.03s
  - Lateral TTC = 11.18/12.38 = 0.90s
  - MDC = min(9.99, 11.18) = 9.99m
- Risk: 2 (High Risk) - rapid approach in both dimensions but still sufficient distance

**Obstacle 30500 (Rear-right):**
- Adjusted distance: longitudinal -11.06m, lateral -8.23m
- Relative velocity: longitudinal -0.92 m/s, lateral 1.33 m/s (approaching)
- Motion: Moving away longitudinally, approaching laterally
- Analysis:
  - Lateral TTC = 8.23/1.33 = 6.19s
  - MDC = longitudinal distance = 11.06m
- Risk: 5 (No Risk) - safe distances in both dimensions

**Obstacle 30502 (Rear-right):**
- Adjusted distance: longitudinal -18.45m, lateral -13.22m
- Relative velocity: longitudinal -1.52 m/s, lateral 0.85 m/s (approaching)
- Motion: Moving away longitudinally, approaching laterally
- Analysis:
  - Lateral TTC = 13.22/0.85 = 15.55s
  - MDC = longitudinal distance = 18.45m
- Risk: 5 (No Risk) - very safe distances

**Obstacle 30503 (Front-right):**
- Adjusted distance: longitudinal 8.48m, lateral -15.67m
- Relative velocity: longitudinal 0.81 m/s (moving away), lateral -6.55 m/s (moving away)
- Motion: Moving away in both dimensions
- Analysis:
  - Both distances increasing
- Risk: 5 (No Risk) - diverging paths

**Trajectory Analysis:**
- No obstacles show both dimensions converging to dangerous distances
- Obstacle 30499 is the most concerning with high approach speeds but still >1s TTC
- Obstacle 30494 has longitudinal alignment but safe lateral separation
- All other obstacles have safe distances or diverging paths

**Conclusion:** This is NOT a collision scenario. The closest risk is Obstacle 30499 with High Risk (2), but no obstacles meet collision (0) or extreme risk (1) criteria.
