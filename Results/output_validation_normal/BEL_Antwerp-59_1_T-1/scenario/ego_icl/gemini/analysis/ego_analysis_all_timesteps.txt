* **Obstacle 30494 (Left):**  This obstacle shows consistent lateral movement away from the ego vehicle, increasing from 8.84m to 16.06m over the timesteps.  Although longitudinally aligned (0.00m longitudinal distance), the lateral movement indicates no collision risk. The large lateral distance and diverging lateral trajectory mean TTC calculation is not relevant in this case.
    * Risk Score: 5 (No Risk)

* **Obstacle 30498 (Rear-right):** Initially behind the ego vehicle, this obstacle's longitudinal distance decreases from -4.55m to -3.31m. The lateral distance also shifts from 0.00m to -2.80m, indicating a slight rightward and forward movement relative to the ego vehicle. Although the longitudinal velocity is close to zero (-0.00 m/s), the small and decreasing distance, combined with the converging lateral movement from -0.06m to -2.80m suggests a potential collision risk if this converging trajectory continues.  The small longitudinal distance (-3.31m) and the consistent lateral approach towards the ego necessitates closer monitoring. MDC is approximately 2.8m.
    * Risk Score: 3 (Medium Risk - due to proximity and converging trajectory)

* **Obstacle 30499 (Front-right):** While this obstacle appears to be approaching longitudinally (decreasing from 3.70m to 9.99mâ€”this increase in distance at the latest timestep suggests the obstacle might be braking or changing lanes. However, given the initial approach from 3.70m, the fluctuation in longitudinal behavior needs careful attention. Laterally, it moves from -25.70m to -11.18m indicating lateral movement towards the ego. TTC calculations would be misleading due to varying longitudinal velocity across the time steps. The MDC in this case is the smallest distance at a given time step which is around 10m (considering both longitudinal and lateral distances). Due to the inconsistent data, and the final relative position and velocity, it would warrant a closer look. 
     * Risk Score: 4 (Low risk) 


* **Obstacle 30500 (Rear-right):** This obstacle is moving away longitudinally (from -13.13m to -11.06m). The lateral distance is also increasing (-0.92m to -8.23m), therefore moving away diagonally from the ego vehicle, and implying increasing MDC value with time.
    * Risk Score: 5 (No Risk)

* **Obstacle 30502 (Rear-right):** Similar to Obstacle 30500, this one is also moving further away both longitudinally (-21.52m to -18.45m) and laterally (-2.05m to -13.22m).
    * Risk Score: 5 (No Risk)

* **Obstacle 30503 (Front-right):** This obstacle has a large and increasing lateral distance (from -13.95m to -15.67m). Longitudinally, it initially approaches from 1.36m and reaches 8.48 m in the last timestep. The converging lateral movement combined with initial longitudinal approach warrants a low risk assignment.
    * Risk Score: 4 (Low risk).


**Collision Scenario Determination:**

No obstacle has a risk score of 0 or 1. Therefore, this is NOT a collision scenario.
