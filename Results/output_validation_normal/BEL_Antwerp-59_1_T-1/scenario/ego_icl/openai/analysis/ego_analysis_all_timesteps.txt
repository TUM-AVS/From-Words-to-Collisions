To analyze the risk of collision at the most recent timestep (0.9 seconds), we'll consider each obstacle individually and calculate the Time-to-Collision (TTC) and Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC) using the adjusted distances. We'll focus on the adjusted values as precise measurements for calculation.

### Obstacle Analysis

#### Obstacle 30494
- **Position**: Left of the ego car
- **Adjusted Longitudinal Distance**: 0.00 m (indicating exact alignment/co-location)
- **Adjusted Lateral Distance**: 16.06 m
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal: -6.85 m/s (driving away), Lateral: 6.91 m/s (moving away)
- **Motion Description**: Moving away laterally

**TTC and MDC Calculation**:
- Since the obstacle is moving away both longitudinally and laterally, the risk of collision is minimal.
- **TTC_longitudinal**: Not applicable as it is moving away (negative relative velocity).
- **MDC**: Primarily the lateral distance considering alignment, which is 16.06 m.

**Risk Assessment**:
- **No Risk (5)**: Given the obstacle's trajectory and increased lateral distance.

#### Obstacle 30498
- **Position**: Rear-right of the ego car
- **Adjusted Longitudinal Distance**: -3.31 m
- **Adjusted Lateral Distance**: -2.80 m
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal: -0.00 m/s, Lateral: 1.99 m/s (moving toward)
- **Motion Description**: Moving toward longitudinally with minor changes, but increasing in lateral distance.

**TTC and MDC Calculation**:
- **TTC_longitudinal**: Not applicable as relative velocity is effectively zero (already moving away/meant for steady position).
- **MDC**: The minimum lateral distance is considered most critical but increasing, indicating a reduced risk of imminent collision.

**Risk Assessment**:
- **Medium Risk (3)**: Due to relative stable positioning longitudinally but increasing lateral separation.

#### Obstacle 30499
- **Position**: Front-right of the ego car
- **Adjusted Longitudinal Distance**: 9.99 m
- **Adjusted Lateral Distance**: -11.18 m
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal: -9.71 m/s (approaching), Lateral: 12.38 m/s (approaching)
- **Motion Description**: Approaching in both components, possibly curving in towards path.

**TTC and MDC Calculation**:
- **TTC_longitudinal**: |9.99 m / -9.71 m/s| ≈ 1.03 seconds (Approaching)
- **MDC**: Both distances are relatively small, adjusted with the approach indicates some risk, but the lateral distance remains significant.

**Risk Assessment**:
- **Medium Risk (3)**: Due to complex trajectory yet no immediate imminent collision prediction.

#### Obstacle 30500
- **Position**: Rear-right of the ego car
- **Adjusted Longitudinal Distance**: -11.06 m
- **Adjusted Lateral Distance**: -8.23 m
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal: -0.92 m/s (moving away), Lateral: 1.33 m/s (approaching)
- **Motion Description**: Moving away longitudinally, approaching slightly laterally.

**TTC and MDC Calculation**:
- **TTC_longitudinal**: Not critical due to movement away.
- **MDC**: Considering lateral crossover incoming, the distance remains significant and increasing.

**Risk Assessment**:
- **Low Risk (4)**: Given movement continues primarily away on critical dimension.

#### Obstacle 30502
- **Position**: Rear-right of the ego car
- **Adjusted Longitudinal Distance**: -18.45 m
- **Adjusted Lateral Distance**: -13.22 m
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal: -1.52 m/s (moving away), Lateral: 0.85 m/s (approaching)
- **Motion Description**: Moving away longitudinally though lateral proximity decreasing slightly.

**TTC and MDC Calculation**:
- **TTC_longitudinal**: Not presently critical, moving away.
- **MDC**: Without significant immediate proximity change, lateral and longitudinal combined at effective safety.

**Risk Assessment**:
- **No Risk (5)**: Based on sustained longitudinal clearance.

#### Obstacle 30503
- **Position**: Front-right of the ego car
- **Adjusted Longitudinal Distance**: 8.48 m
- **Adjusted Lateral Distance**: -15.67 m
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal: 0.81 m/s (approaching), Lateral: -6.55 m/s (moving away)
- **Motion Description**: Moving away in critical lateral dimension while approaching longitudinal dimension.

**TTC and MDC Calculation**:
- **TTC_longitudinal**: |8.48 m / 0.81 m/s| ≈ 10.47 seconds (Safe viewing)
- **MDC**: Despite long approach, the moving away laterally permits sufficient clearance under normal trajectory.

**Risk Assessment**:
- **No Risk (5)**: Given ample prospective avoidance feature.

### Scenario Conclusion
Analyzing the most recent data using trajectory insights and obstacle movements indicates this scenario is not a collision scenario. Adjustments and confirmation show lateral and longitudinal clearances remaining safe under prediction with no imminent high-risk encoder.
