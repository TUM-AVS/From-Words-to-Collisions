The ego vehicle and obstacle 30694 are in the same lanelet initially.  The lateral distance between them is significant, but the obstacle is approaching the ego vehicle from behind at a higher speed initially.  However, both vehicles are decelerating. At t=0.4s, the obstacle changes to a different lanelet (1308), significantly reducing collision risk. While the distance between them continues to decrease in the following timesteps, the lane change suggests they are diverging. Therefore, there's no immediate collision risk.
