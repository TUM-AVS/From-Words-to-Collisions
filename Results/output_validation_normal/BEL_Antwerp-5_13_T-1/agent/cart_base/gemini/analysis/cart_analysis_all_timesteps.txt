The ego vehicle and obstacle 30694 are in the same lanelet (539) initially and moving in roughly the same direction (similar orientations).  The obstacle is behind the ego vehicle but traveling faster. However, at t=0.4s, the obstacle changes to lanelet 1308, diverging from the ego vehicle's path. This lane change mitigates the collision risk significantly. While they are still relatively close in proximity before the lane change, the subsequent trajectories indicate they are moving apart.  Therefore, there is no immediate collision risk.
