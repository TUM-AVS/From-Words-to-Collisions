### Analysis:

1. **Relative Motion and Distance**:  
   - At 0.9 seconds, the ego vehicle (ID: 30695) is at (-358.0567, -114.2893) and the obstacle (ID: 30694) is at (-365.5084, -130.6193).  
   - The Euclidean distance between them is approximately 18.5 meters.  
   - The obstacle is behind the ego vehicle and moving in the same lanelet (1308.0 for obstacle, 539.0 for ego, but lanelet transitions suggest they are on a shared path).  

2. **Velocity and Acceleration**:  
   - Ego velocity: 8.553 m/s (decelerating at -1.5583 m/s²).  
   - Obstacle velocity: 11.4629 m/s (decelerating at -2.0043 m/s²).  
   - Relative longitudinal velocity: ~2.91 m/s (obstacle is closing in).  

3. **Time to Collision (TTC)**:  
   - Relative longitudinal distance: ~16.4 meters (approximate projection along the lane).  
   - TTC = 16.4 / 2.91 ≈ 5.64 seconds.  
   - This TTC is relatively high, indicating no immediate collision risk.  

4. **Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC)**:  
   - The lateral separation (assuming same lanelet) is minimal, but the obstacle is behind and decelerating faster than the ego.  

5. **Risk Assessment**:  
   - The obstacle is closing in but at a manageable rate with sufficient time to react.  
   - No collision or extreme risk is observed in the given timesteps.
