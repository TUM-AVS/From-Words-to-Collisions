At t=0.9s, the ego vehicle at (-358.0567, -114.2893) is in lanelet 539. The obstacle (ID 30694) at (-365.5084, -130.6193) is in lanelet 1308.

Analyzing the provided data, we can observe the following:

1. **Lateral Separation:**  The obstacle and ego vehicle are in different lanelets, suggesting some degree of lateral separation.  However, the provided data doesn't give us lanelet geometry, so we cannot definitively assess the minimum lateral distance.  Assuming typical lane widths, a lateral distance of at least 3 meters is probable.

2. **Longitudinal Separation:**  The longitudinal distance at t=0.9s is approximately 7.45m. This separation is likely safe if the vehicles maintain their current trajectories and lanelets.

3. **Relative Velocity and Acceleration:**  While the vehicles have similar orientations and speeds, the detailed velocity and acceleration information is not enough to accurately calculate TTC without decomposing into longitudinal and lateral components relative to each vehicle's orientation. The raw provided data does not give enough information to fully analyze the interaction with the Cartesian data.

4. **Trajectory Prediction (Limited):** From the data, both vehicles seem to be decelerating.  However, the limited timeframe and the switch of the obstacle to a different lanelet at 0.4s makes predicting their future trajectories challenging. The provided data does not indicate an immediate risk of collision.

**Risk Assessment:**

Given the lateral separation due to different lanelets, and a moderate longitudinal separation with both vehicles decelerating, I classify the risk as "Low risk" (4).  The limited data and lack of clear lane geometry prevent a more precise TTC and MDC calculation, making it impossible to definitively rule out potential future conflicts as they move into and out of the lanelets mentioned. More information is needed to refine the analysis.
