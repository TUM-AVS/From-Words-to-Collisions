To evaluate the potential collision scenario between the ego vehicle and the obstacle at the specified timeframes, we need to analyze the relative positions, velocities, and potential engagement of each entity. Additionally, using the most recent available data (0.9 seconds), we will determine the Time to Collision (TTC) and Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC) metrics for risk assessment.

### Detailed Analysis

At 0.9 seconds:
- **Ego Position**: (-358.0567, -114.2893)
- **Obstacle Position**: (-365.5084, -130.6193)

#### Relative Position Analysis
- **Longitudinal Distance**: Obstacle is ahead longitudinally by approximately 7.4517 meters.
- **Lateral Distance**: The lateral displacement (difference in Y coordinates) is approximately 16.33 meters, indicating a considerable separation in lateral position.

#### Velocity and Orientation
- **Ego Velocity**: 8.553 m/s, orientation -1.9983 radians.
- **Obstacle Velocity**: 11.4629 m/s, orientation -1.9991 radians.

#### TTC Calculation
- **Relative Longitudinal Velocity**: The obstacle is moving faster than the ego vehicle. The relative closing velocity = 11.4629 - 8.553 = 2.9099 m/s (obstacle pulling away).
- **TTC**: Since the obstacle is ahead but moving away (positive relative velocity), TTC isn't applicable for collision estimation in this context.

#### MDC Consideration
- The significant lateral distance (~16.33 meters) reduces immediate collision risk.

### Summary Findings
Given these insights, the risk of collision at the last timestep is negligible. The motion indicates that the obstacle is not in the ego vehicle's immediate path, aligning in the same or adjacent lanelet but sufficiently apart laterally.

### Risk Scoring
- **Position**: 5
- **Orientation**: 5
- **Velocity**: 5
- **Acceleration**: 5

In conclusion, there is no immediate risk of collision in this scenario based on trajectory analysis, relative motion, and lane alignment. The distances involved, and the differential in speed while maintaining or increasing lateral separation, denote negligible collision risk at this moment.
