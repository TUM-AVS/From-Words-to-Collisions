At the most recent timestep (0.9 seconds), obstacle 30694 is 13.44 meters in front of the ego vehicle and moving away with a longitudinal velocity of 2.91 m/s.  The lateral distance is essentially zero, but the obstacle is moving longitudinally away from the ego vehicle, decreasing the risk. Given the increasing distance and separating velocity, there is no immediate risk of collision.
