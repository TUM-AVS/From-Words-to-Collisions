### Obstacle Analysis:

#### Obstacle 30694:
- **Direction**: Front of the ego car
- **Most Recent Timestep (0.9s)**:
  - **Adjusted Longitudinal Distance**: 13.44 m (increasing)
  - **Adjusted Lateral Distance**: 0.00 m (stable)
  - **Relative Velocity**: 
    - Longitudinal: 2.91 m/s (moving away)
    - Lateral: -0.01 m/s (negligible)
  - **Motion Description**: "Obstacle is moving away longitudinally. Exact lateral alignment or unknown case."

#### Trajectory Analysis:
- The obstacle is consistently moving away from the ego vehicle longitudinally (distance increases from 11.95 m to 13.44 m over 0.9s).
- Lateral distance remains 0.00 m (exact alignment), but there is no significant lateral movement (velocity ≈ 0 m/s).
- The relative velocity is positive longitudinally (2.91 m/s), meaning the obstacle is moving away from the ego vehicle.

#### TTC Calculation:
- Longitudinal TTC: Not applicable (distance increasing, relative velocity positive).
- Lateral TTC: Not applicable (no significant lateral movement).

#### MDC Calculation:
- Since the obstacle is moving away longitudinally and laterally stable, the MDC is effectively the current longitudinal distance (13.44 m), which is far greater than 5.0 m.

#### Risk Assessment:
- **Proximity**: Low (distance > 5.0 m and increasing).
- **MDC**: 13.44 m → No Risk (5).
- **TTC**: Not applicable (diverging paths).
- **Overall Risk**: Negligible (5).
