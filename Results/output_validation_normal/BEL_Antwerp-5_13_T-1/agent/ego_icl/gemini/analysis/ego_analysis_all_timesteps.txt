Obstacle 30694 is in front of the ego vehicle and has been consistently moving away over the past 0.9 seconds.  At the most recent timestep (0.9s), it is 13.44m longitudinally and 0.00m laterally away from the ego vehicle. The lateral alignment suggests the obstacle is in the same lane as the ego vehicle.

The longitudinal relative velocity is 2.91 m/s (moving away) and the lateral relative velocity is -0.01 m/s. Since the obstacle is moving away longitudinally, the TTC is not applicable for collision assessment. The MDC is essentially the lateral distance, which is 0.00m. However, since the obstacle is moving away longitudinally and slightly towards the ego vehicle laterally, a collision is highly unlikely.

Given the longitudinal distance of 13.44m and the fact that the obstacle is moving away, the risk is negligible.
