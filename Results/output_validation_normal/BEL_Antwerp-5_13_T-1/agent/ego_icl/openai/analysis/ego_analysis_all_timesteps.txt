To properly assess the collision risk of Obstacle 30694 with the ego vehicle, we focus on the most recent timestep (0.9 seconds) and the historical data to understand its trajectory. Here's a detailed analysis for Obstacle 30694:

### Trajectory Analysis
- **Position over time:** The obstacle is consistently moving away from the ego vehicle. Longitudinally, the distance increases steadily from 11.95m at 0.1 seconds to 13.44m at 0.9 seconds.
- **Velocity analysis:** Longitudinal velocity indicates a positive trend: starting at 1.68 m/s and increasing to 2.91 m/s, which means the obstacle is moving away from the ego car. The lateral velocity remains negligible.
- **Motion Description:** The consistent motion and increasing distance confirm that the obstacle is not closing in on the ego vehicle.

### Calculations
- **Time-to-Collision (TTC):** Since the obstacle is moving further away (positive relative velocity longitudinally), TTC is effectively not applicable. No projected intersection with the ego vehicle path.
- **Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC):**
  - Since the obstacle is moving away and the longitudinal distance is increasing, MDC > 5.0 meters over this timeframe.
  - Lateral MDC is effectively infinite since lateral motion is minimal and increasing longitudinally.

### Risk Assessment
- **Directional Focus:** As the obstacle is directly in front, we primarily assess longitudinal data. The lateral component does not indicate any concerning proximity.
- **Risk Scores:**
  - **TTC and MDC analysis points to No Risk.** The obstacle is moving away, and the distance gap is widening.
  - Based on current movement and trajectory, neither the TTC nor MDC metrics fall into concern zones for collision.

Given the above calculations and trajectory understanding, we conclude the following JSON summary of the risk assessment:

```json
{
    "CollisionObstacle": null,
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null,
    "HighRiskObstacle": null
}
```

Since Obstacle 30694 represents no immediate threat to the ego vehicle, it is categorized at a negligible risk level (5), thus not appearing in the Collision, Extreme Risk, or High Risk obstacle categories.
