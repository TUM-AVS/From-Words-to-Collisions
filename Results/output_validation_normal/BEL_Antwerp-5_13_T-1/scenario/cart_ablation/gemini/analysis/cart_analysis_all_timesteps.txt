At t=0.9s, the ego vehicle is at (-358.0567, -114.2893) in lanelet 539. The obstacle (ID 30694.0) is at (-365.5084, -130.6193) in lanelet 1308.  While the obstacle has moved to a different lanelet,  it's still important to assess the distance and relative velocities. The trajectories from previous timesteps show that both vehicles were initially in the same lanelet and the obstacle has since changed lanes, likely indicating a lane change maneuver. While a significant lateral separation is developing, it's not yet sufficient to completely rule out potential extreme risk, depending on the vehicle dimensions and the exact nature of the lane change. However, based on the provided data, it appears the risk is decreasing. Therefore, I classify this as a Medium risk (3) and not Extreme (1).
