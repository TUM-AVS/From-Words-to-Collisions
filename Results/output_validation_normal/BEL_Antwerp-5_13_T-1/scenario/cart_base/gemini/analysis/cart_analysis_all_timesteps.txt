At t=0.9s, the ego vehicle at (-358.0567, -114.2893) in lanelet 539 and the obstacle 30694 at (-365.5084, -130.6193) in lanelet 1308. While the obstacle has moved to a different lanelet, suggesting a diverging trajectory, it's crucial to consider the previous timesteps.  The obstacle was in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle up to t=0.4s and the lateral distance between them is still relatively small. Given their respective velocities and decelerations, a medium risk assessment is appropriate. Though the lane change lowers the immediate risk, the close proximity and recent shared lanelet warrant caution and continued monitoring.
