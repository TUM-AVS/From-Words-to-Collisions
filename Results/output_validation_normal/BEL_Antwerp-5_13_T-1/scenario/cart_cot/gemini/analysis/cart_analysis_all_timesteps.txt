### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 30694.0
- Distance Risk reason: The obstacle is in a different lanelet at the last timestep, significantly reducing the risk of collision. While initially in the same lane, the obstacle's trajectory shows a clear divergence into lanelet 1308.  The lateral distance is increasing over time.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Although both the ego vehicle and obstacle are moving in roughly the same overall direction (southward based on negative y-coordinate changes), the differing lanelets and increasing lateral separation lessen the time-based risk. Their velocities are similar, and both decelerating but their diverging paths are the critical factor.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. **Identify the most critical obstacles:** Obstacle 30694.0 was initially the most critical as it shared the same lanelet as the ego vehicle.
2. **Analyze their trajectories over all 10 timesteps:**  The obstacle's trajectory indicates a lane change, moving from lanelet 539 to lanelet 1308.  The ego vehicle remains in lanelet 539.
3. **Evaluate relative positions, velocities, and accelerations:** Initially, the obstacle was relatively close to and behind the ego vehicle.  However, the lateral distance increased as the obstacle changed lanes.  Both vehicles are decelerating, but this doesn't pose a collision risk given their diverging trajectories.
4. **Determine if any collision has occurred or is imminent:** No collision has occurred, and none is imminent based on the observed trajectories.
5. **Explain your reasoning for your conclusion:** The obstacleâ€™s lane change maneuver effectively mitigates the initial risk of collision. The increasing lateral distance and different lanelets at the most recent timestep significantly reduce the likelihood of impact.

    "Reasoning": "Although the obstacle started in the same lane and relatively close to the ego vehicle, its subsequent lane change into lanelet 1308 while the ego vehicle remained in lanelet 539 significantly reduced the risk of collision.  The increasing lateral separation over time and their diverging paths indicate no immediate or imminent collision risk."
