### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep:

### Obstacle Analysis:
- **Obstacle ID**: 30694.0  
  - **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is in a different lanelet (1308.0) compared to the ego vehicle (539.0) at the most recent timestep. The Euclidean distance between them is approximately 16.33 meters, which is relatively safe. Over the previous timesteps, the obstacle has been moving away from the ego vehicle.  
  - **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)  
  - **Time Risk reason**: The relative velocity between the ego vehicle (8.553 m/s) and the obstacle (11.4629 m/s) is ~2.91 m/s (obstacle moving faster). The TTC is ~5.61 seconds (distance/relative velocity), which is sufficient for the ego vehicle to react. The obstacle's acceleration trends show consistent deceleration.  
  - **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)  
  - **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low Risk)  

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. **Lanelet Check**: The obstacle transitions to lanelet 1308.0 at 0.4 seconds, while the ego remains in lanelet 539.0. No lane overlap.  
2. **Trajectory Analysis**: The obstacle is moving away from the ego vehicle with increasing separation distance over time.  
3. **Velocity/Acceleration**: The obstacle is decelerating but still moving faster than the ego, increasing the gap.  
4. **Collision Risk**: No immediate or high-risk collision threat due to sufficient distance and TTC.
