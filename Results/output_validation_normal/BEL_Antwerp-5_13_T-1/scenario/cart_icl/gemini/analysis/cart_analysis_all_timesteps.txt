### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 30691.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is in a different lanelet and relatively far from the ego vehicle.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason:  The obstacle's trajectory does not intersect with the ego vehicle's.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 30692.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is in a different lanelet and far from the ego vehicle.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: The obstacle's trajectory does not intersect with the ego vehicle's.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 30693.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is in a different lanelet and relatively far from the ego vehicle.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: The obstacle's trajectory does not intersect with the ego vehicle's.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 30694.0
- Distance Risk reason: Although in a different lanelet now, this obstacle was previously in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle and is relatively close.  Needs monitoring.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: The obstacle appears to be moving away from the ego vehicle based on past trajectory.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- Obstacle ID: 30696.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is in a different lanelet and far from the ego vehicle.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: The obstacle's trajectory does not intersect with the ego vehicle's.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5


### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
No obstacles are on a direct collision course with the ego vehicle. Obstacle 30694.0 changed lanelets and is moving away from the ego vehicle.  Therefore, this is not a collision scenario.

### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
  "CollisionObstacles": [],
  "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null,
  "ScenarioAnalysis": {
    "IsCollisionScenario": false,
    "Reasoning": "No obstacle is predicted to collide with the ego vehicle.  All obstacles are either in different lanelets or moving away from the ego vehicle's path."
  }
}
