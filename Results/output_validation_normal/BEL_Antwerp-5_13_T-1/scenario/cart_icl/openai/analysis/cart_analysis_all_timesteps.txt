### Obstacle Analysis:

#### Obstacle 30691:
- **Distance Risk Reason**: This obstacle is not in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle. Over the time steps, it has remained at a safe distance without crossing paths with the ego vehicle.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 5
- **Time Risk Reason**: The obstacle is decelerating significantly and moving away from the ego with reducing speed, posing no imminent threat.
- **Time Safety Score**: 5
- **Overall Risk Score**: 5

#### Obstacle 30692:
- **Distance Risk Reason**: The obstacle is located in a different lanelet and is not moving towards the trajectory of the ego vehicle.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 5
- **Time Risk Reason**: It maintains a consistent velocity and position without trend changes affecting the ego vehicle.
- **Time Safety Score**: 5
- **Overall Risk Score**: 5

#### Obstacle 30693:
- **Distance Risk Reason**: This obstacle consistently remains in a different lanelet, and the distance between the ego and the obstacle is significant.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 5
- **Time Risk Reason**: Although decelerating, its velocity trajectory does not imply an intersection with the ego's path.
- **Time Safety Score**: 5
- **Overall Risk Score**: 5

#### Obstacle 30694:
- **Distance Risk Reason**: The obstacle shares the lanelet with the ego vehicle between some intervals but due to their consistent trajectory patterns maintains a safe distance.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 4
- **Time Risk Reason**: Despite being in the same general lanelet, the obstacle's velocity and position show minimal risk of collision over the trajectory history.
- **Time Safety Score**: 4
- **Overall Risk Score**: 4

#### Obstacle 30696:
- **Distance Risk Reason**: Positioned in a different lanelet with no approach towards the ego vehicle.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 5
- **Time Risk Reason**: It shows a consistent and distinct path, velocity does not threaten the ego vehicle's trajectory.
- **Time Safety Score**: 5
- **Overall Risk Score**: 5

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
The analysis indicates that none of the obstacles present a collision risk based on their trajectories and distances from the ego vehicle. No intersecting paths or high-velocity approaches toward the ego are observed, suggesting an absence of immediate collision scenarios.
