Obstacle 30694 is moving away from the ego vehicle with increasing longitudinal distance and a positive longitudinal relative velocity.  The lateral distance is consistently zero, indicating perfect alignment or an unknown lateral position. While the relative acceleration fluctuates, the overall trend shows increasing separation. At the most recent timestep (0.9 seconds), the obstacle is 13.44 meters ahead and moving away at 2.91 m/s. This poses no immediate risk.
