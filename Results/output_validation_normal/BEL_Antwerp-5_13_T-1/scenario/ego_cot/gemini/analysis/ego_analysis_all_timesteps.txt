### Safety analysis for timestep 0.9 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 30694
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 30694 is located in front of the ego vehicle at a lateral and longitudinal distance of 13.44 meters.  This substantial distance suggests no immediate risk. The obstacle is moving away longitudinally.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason:  Since the obstacle is moving away from the ego vehicle with increasing longitudinal velocity, the TTC is very high. This suggests no immediate time-related collision risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5
