### Obstacle-by-Obstacle Analysis

#### Obstacle 30694 (Most Recent Timestep: 0.9s)
- **Position**: Front of ego car
- **Adjusted Distances**: 
  - Longitudinal: 13.44 m (raw distance, adjusted distance not provided, assuming raw distance is used)
  - Lateral: 0.00 m (exact alignment)
- **Relative Velocity**: 
  - Longitudinal: 2.91 m/s (moving away from ego)
  - Lateral: -0.01 m/s (negligible lateral movement)
- **Motion Description**: Obstacle is moving away longitudinally. Exact lateral alignment or unknown case.

#### Trajectory Analysis (Across Timesteps)
- The obstacle is consistently moving away from the ego vehicle longitudinally (distance increases from 11.95m to 13.44m over 0.9s).
- Lateral distance remains at 0.00m, but the relative lateral velocity is negligible (-0.01 m/s), indicating no significant lateral movement.
- The longitudinal relative velocity is positive and increasing (from 1.68 m/s to 2.91 m/s), confirming the obstacle is accelerating away from the ego vehicle.

#### TTC Calculation
- Longitudinal TTC: Not applicable (relative velocity is positive, meaning the obstacle is moving away; no collision course).
- Lateral TTC: Not applicable (lateral relative velocity is negligible and not converging).

#### MDC Calculation
- Since the obstacle is moving away longitudinally and laterally aligned, the MDC is effectively the current longitudinal distance (13.44 m), which is far beyond the 5.0 m threshold for "No Risk."
- Lateral MDC is 0.00 m, but since the obstacle is not moving laterally toward the ego, this does not indicate a collision risk.

#### Risk Assessment
- **Longitudinal Risk**: No Risk (5) - MDC > 5.0 m and TTC not applicable (moving away).
- **Lateral Risk**: No Risk (5) - MDC = 0.00 m but no converging motion.
- **Overall Risk Score**: 5 (No Risk).

### Conclusion
- No collision or extreme risk is present. The obstacle is moving away from the ego vehicle in the longitudinal direction and is not a threat.
- This is **not** a collision scenario.
