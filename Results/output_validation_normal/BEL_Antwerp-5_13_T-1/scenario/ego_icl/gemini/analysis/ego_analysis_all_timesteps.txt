Obstacle 30694 Analysis:

Trajectory Analysis: Over the past 0.9 seconds, obstacle 30694 has consistently been in front of the ego vehicle and moving away longitudinally. The lateral distance remains consistently at 0.00 m, indicating continued alignment in the lateral direction. The longitudinal distance is increasing, starting from 11.95m and reaching 13.44m at the last timestep.

TTC Calculation: Since the relative longitudinal velocity is positive (moving away), TTC is not applicable in the longitudinal direction.  Lateral velocity is near zero, so lateral TTC calculation is also not meaningful in this case.

MDC Calculation: Given the obstacle is directly in front and moving away, MDC is primarily determined by the lateral distance, which is 0.00m. However, as the longitudinal distance is increasing, the lateral alignment alone does not pose an immediate collision risk.


Risk Assessment:
- Longitudinal Risk: No Risk (5) due to increasing distance and motion directly away from the ego vehicle.
- Lateral Risk: Given that obstacle is aligned laterally but longitudinally moving away, the current MDC poses minimal risk, the lateral distance is 0m, assigning Medium risk (3) while acknowledging its location directly ahead of the ego.


Overall Risk: Since the obstacle is moving away longitudinally, despite the exact lateral alignment, the overall risk is assessed as Medium Risk (3).

Collision Scenario Determination:

This is NOT a collision scenario. No obstacle has a risk score of 0 (collision) or 1 (extreme risk).
