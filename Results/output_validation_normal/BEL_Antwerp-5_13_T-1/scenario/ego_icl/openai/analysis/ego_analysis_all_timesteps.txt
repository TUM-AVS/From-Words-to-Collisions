Let's perform an analysis of the scenario using the data provided.

### Obstacle-by-Obstacle Analysis

#### Obstacle 30694 - Detailed Analysis
- **Trajectory Overview:**
  - From 0.0s to 0.9s, the obstacle is continuously in front of the ego vehicle.
  - Longitudinal distance increases from 11.95m to 13.44m, indicating the obstacle is moving away from the ego vehicle.
  - Lateral distance remains exactly 0.00m across all timesteps, showing perfect longitudinal alignment.

- **Last Timestep at 0.9 seconds:**
  - **Adjusted Distances to Consider:**
    - **Longitudinal Distance:** 13.44 meters
    - **Lateral Distance:** 0.00 meters

- **Relative Motion:**
  - **Longitudinal Velocity:** 2.91 m/s (Obstacle moving away)
  - **Lateral Velocity:** -0.01 m/s (Negligible, obstacle remains aligned)

- **Time-to-Collision (TTC) Calculations:**
  - Given the relative velocity is positive (moving away), the TTC in the longitudinal direction would be theoretical and not relevant for impending collision detection. 

- **Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC):**
  - Given perfect longitudinal alignment (lateral = 0.00m), but increasing separation, MDC is theoretically infinite as paths do not intersect to collide. 

- **Motion Description:**
  - Obstacle is moving away longitudinally, matching the analysis of increasing longitudinal distance and velocity away.

#### Risk Assessment
- **Longitudinal Risk:**
  - With the relative velocity of 2.91 m/s moving away, there's no immediate risk in the longitudinal axis.
  
- **Lateral Risk:**
  - Exact alignment at 0.00 m, but lateral velocity and motion indicate no threatening convergence; therefore, no collision is imminent.

- **TTC & MDC Calculations:**
  - Both metrics suggest an increasing distance and negative convergence, supporting a `No Risk` status in both dimensions.

- **Overall Risk Score:** 5 (No Risk)
  - **No TTC risk** due to divergence.
  - **No MDC risk** beyond alignment.

### Conclusion
From the analysis of all available data, Obstacle 30694 presents no risk of collision as it is continuously moving away from the ego vehicle. 

### Determination
This is **not** a collision scenario as the obstacle is determined to have a `No Risk` status with diverging trajectories and no intersecting paths.
