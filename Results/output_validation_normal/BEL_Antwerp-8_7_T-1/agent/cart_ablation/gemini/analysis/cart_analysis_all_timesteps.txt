Obstacle 30597 is moving away from the ego vehicle and into a different lanelet (1046), posing no collision risk.

Obstacle 30598 is in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle (195).  While initially it appears to be slightly ahead and to the left of the ego vehicle, both its x and y positions are getting closer to the ego vehicle's over the timesteps. Additionally, obstacle 30598's velocity is similar to the ego vehicle, but its acceleration is fluctuating, making its future trajectory less predictable.  Due to the decreasing distance and the unpredictable acceleration, this poses a potential risk, classifying it as a High Risk.
