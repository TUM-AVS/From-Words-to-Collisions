Obstacle 30597.0 changes lanelets from 195 to 1046, suggesting a lane change maneuver away from the ego vehicle. Its lateral distance from the ego vehicle is significant and increasing. Although the longitudinal distance is decreasing, the lane change makes a collision unlikely.

Obstacle 30598.0 remains in the same lane as the ego vehicle (lanelet 195). Initially, it is behind the ego vehicle but its longitudinal distance to the ego vehicle is decreasing, implying it's approaching the ego vehicle from behind. While its acceleration fluctuates, its overall trend is towards the ego vehicle, increasing the collision risk if this trend continues. This warrants closer monitoring but doesn't represent an immediate collision risk yet.
