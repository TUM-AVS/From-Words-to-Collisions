### Analysis:

1. **Obstacle 30597 (ID: 30597)**:
   - **Position**: (360.7739, 533.1008) at 0.9s
   - **Relative Position to Ego**: Ego is at (352.2857, 549.6251), so obstacle is ahead and to the left.
   - **Relative Velocity**: Ego velocity is 5.6293 m/s, obstacle velocity is 5.3541 m/s (slower).
   - **TTC**: Not immediately critical as the obstacle is moving away from the ego's path (lanelet 1046.0 vs. ego's lanelet 195.0).
   - **MDC**: Lateral distance is significant, and longitudinal distance is increasing.
   - **Risk**: **Low (4)**.

2. **Obstacle 30598 (ID: 30598)**:
   - **Position**: (345.4857, 566.1252) at 0.9s
   - **Relative Position to Ego**: Ego is at (352.2857, 549.6251), so obstacle is behind and to the right.
   - **Relative Velocity**: Ego velocity is 5.6293 m/s, obstacle velocity is 8.5477 m/s (approaching from behind).
   - **TTC**: The obstacle is closing the distance but is still behind and in the same lanelet (195.0). The longitudinal distance is ~16.5m, and the relative velocity is ~2.92 m/s, giving a TTC of ~5.65s.
   - **MDC**: Lateral distance is minimal, but the obstacle is decelerating sharply (-3.7658 m/sÂ²).
   - **Risk**: **Medium (3)** due to the closing speed but sufficient time to react.
