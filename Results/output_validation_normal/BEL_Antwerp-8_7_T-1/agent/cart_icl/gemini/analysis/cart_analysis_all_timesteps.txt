At t=0.9s, the ego vehicle (ID 30595) is at (352.2857, 549.6251) with a velocity of 5.63 m/s and decelerating at -1.42 m/s². Let's analyze the two obstacles:

**Obstacle 30597:** This obstacle is at (360.7739, 533.1008), placing it in a different lanelet (1046) and laterally offset from the ego vehicle.  Its velocity is 5.35 m/s and decelerating at -1.50 m/s². Given the lateral separation and the fact that both vehicles are decelerating, the risk of collision is low.

**Obstacle 30598:** This obstacle is positioned at (345.4857, 566.1252) within the same lanelet (195) as the ego vehicle.  It is traveling at 8.55 m/s and decelerating sharply at -3.77 m/s². While the obstacle is ahead of the ego vehicle in terms of Y-coordinate (and thus might seem safe initially), the closing velocity needs to be carefully considered. Calculating relative motion between the ego and obstacle:

* **Relative Position (Y):** 566.1252 - 549.6251 = 16.5001 m
* **Relative Velocity (Y):** 8.55 - 5.63 = 2.92 m/s (Obstacle 30598 is moving faster)

Although the relative velocity indicates that Obstacle 30598 is moving faster currently, its substantial deceleration suggests it will slow down significantly in the near future.  A simplified TTC calculation (16.5001 / 2.92 ≈ 5.65s) would overestimate the time to collision in this case due to non-constant velocities. Considering the rate of deceleration (-3.77m/s²) and the approaching ego vehicle, the risk increases. This warrants a higher risk assessment.

**Risk Summary:**

* **Obstacle 30597:** Low Risk (4) - Due to lateral separation and deceleration.
* **Obstacle 30598:** Medium Risk (3) - Same lanelet, closing distance, but the sharp deceleration of the obstacle might avert a collision if the ego vehicle also reacts appropriately.
