### Analysis:

At **0.9 seconds**, the situation is analyzed for potential collisions focusing on the most recent timestep and using earlier steps for trajectory trends and motion patterns.

#### Ego Vehicle (30595.0)
- **Position**: (352.2857, 549.6251)
- **Orientation**: -1.160
- **Velocity**: 5.6293
- **Acceleration**: -1.4191
- **Lanelet**: 195.0

#### Obstacle 30597.0
- **Position**: (360.7739, 533.1008)
- **Orientation**: -1.0742
- **Velocity**: 5.3541
- **Acceleration**: -1.4985
- **Lanelet**: 1046.0

#### Obstacle 30598.0
- **Position**: (345.4857, 566.1252)
- **Orientation**: -1.1949
- **Velocity**: 8.5477
- **Acceleration**: -3.7658
- **Lanelet**: 195.0

### Assessment:

1. **Obstacle 30597.0**:
   - Relative position indicates this obstacle is far ahead on the Y-axis.
   - While both Ego and Obstacle 30597.0 have similar velocities, they are located in different lanelets, reducing direct collision risk.
   - **Risk Assessment**: Minimal risk of collision due to separate lanes and lack of significant converging vectors. **Overall Risk Score**: 5

2. **Obstacle 30598.0**:
   - This obstacle is in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle.
   - The relative positions suggest this obstacle is behind the ego vehicle and moving slightly faster.
   - **TTC and MDC** calculations indicate:
     - Relative longitudinal position:  -6.8m (behind ego)
     - Relative longitudinal velocity: 2.9184 m/s (closing in)
     - TTC = -6.8 / 2.9184 â‰ˆ -2.33s (overtaking from behind)
     - Lateral distance: negligible as same lanelet.
   - The obstacle's velocity and negative acceleration indicate it is slowing down yet still poses some risk as it is moving faster than the ego vehicle.
   - **Risk Assessment**: Close to collision, needs attention. **Overall Risk Score**: 2

No obstacle is in immediate collision or extreme risk, although Obstacle 30598.0 requires careful monitoring.
