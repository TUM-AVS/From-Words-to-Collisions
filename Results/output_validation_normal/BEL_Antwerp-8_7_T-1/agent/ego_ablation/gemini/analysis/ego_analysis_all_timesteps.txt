At the most recent timestep (0.9 seconds), Obstacle 30597 is in front of the ego vehicle at a longitudinal distance of 14.03 meters and continues to drive towards the ego vehicle with a closing longitudinal relative velocity of -0.30 m/s.  However, the lateral relative velocity is 0.46 m/s, indicating that it might be moving laterally away from directly in front of the ego vehicle.  Given the distance and moderately low relative longitudinal velocity, it does not present an immediate extreme risk of collision.

Obstacle 30598 is behind the ego vehicle at a longitudinal distance of -13.34 meters and is approaching the ego vehicle from behind, closing at 2.91 m/s. While this higher closing speed than that of Obstacle 30597 warrants attention, the distance still provides a reasonable buffer.  

Therefore, neither obstacle presents an extreme risk of collision in the immediate future (within the next second or two, based on the limited trajectory provided).  Both, however, warrant continued monitoring.
