At t=0.9s, Obstacle 30597 is in front of the ego vehicle at a longitudinal distance of 14.03m and moving towards the ego vehicle with a relative longitudinal velocity of -0.30 m/s.  Obstacle 30598 is behind the ego vehicle at a longitudinal distance of -13.34m and moving towards the ego vehicle (from behind) with a relative longitudinal velocity of 2.91 m/s.

Obstacle 30598 poses a higher risk due to its relatively high closing velocity and proximity. While both obstacles are relatively close, obstacle 30597's slow closing velocity suggests a low risk of collision in the immediate future. Obstacle 30598's closing velocity warrants a high-risk assessment, requiring attention.
