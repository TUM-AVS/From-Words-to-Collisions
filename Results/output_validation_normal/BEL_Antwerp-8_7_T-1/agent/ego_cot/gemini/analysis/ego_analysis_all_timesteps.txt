### Safety analysis for timestep 0.9s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

There are no adjusted distances provided in the context. Thus, the provided real distances (longitudinal and lateral) will be used directly in the analysis.  It is strongly recommended to provide adjusted distances for more accurate assessment in the future. It's important to note that using raw distances without accounting for vehicle size might lead to underestimation of risk.

**Obstacle Analysis:**

- **Obstacle ID:** 30597
- **Distance Risk reason:** Obstacle is located at 14.03m longitudinally and 14.03m laterally in front of the ego vehicle. The lateral distance and diagonal distance suggests no immediate risk, but the obstacle is moving towards the ego vehicle longitudinally.
- **Distance safety score:** 4
- **Time Risk reason:** The provided data shows the longitudinal relative velocity is negative and relatively small (-0.30 m/s).  Without adjusted distances and assuming a constant velocity, a rough estimate of TTClong would be greater than 45 seconds (14.03m / 0.30m/s), if the relative lateral velocity remained constant and there was no lateral movement from the ego vehicle, the TTClat would be approximately 30 seconds.
- **Time safety score:** 5
- **Overall Risk score:** 4


- **Obstacle ID:** 30598
- **Distance Risk reason:** Obstacle is located at -13.34m longitudinally and -13.34m laterally behind the ego vehicle.  The lateral distance and diagonal distance suggests no immediate risk, but the obstacle is approaching the ego vehicle longitudinally.
- **Distance safety score:** 4
- **Time Risk reason:** The provided data shows a positive longitudinal relative velocity of 2.91 m/s. Without adjusted distances and assuming a constant velocity, TTClong is roughly  4.58 seconds (13.34m / 2.91 m/s).  This suggests a potential risk if the ego vehicle were to brake or if the following vehicle's relative speed increased substantially. Assuming constant lateral velocity and no lateral movement from the ego vehicle, TTClat is approximately -44s. The negative sign suggests the objects are diverging laterally.
- **Time safety score:** 4
- **Overall Risk score:** 4
