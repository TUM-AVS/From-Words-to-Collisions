### Obstacle-by-Obstacle Analysis at the Most Recent Timestep (0.9 seconds)

**Obstacle 30597**
- **Position**: In front of the ego vehicle
- **Adjusted Distances**: Longitudinal = 14.03 m, Lateral = 0.00 m
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal = -0.30 m/s, Lateral = 0.46 m/s
- **Trajectory and Motion**: The obstacle is directly in front, moving toward the ego vehicle, confirmed by the negative longitudinal velocity, and motion description shows "Exact longitudinal alignment."

- **Time-to-Collision (TTC) Calculation**: 
  - Longitudinal direction is critical.
  - TTC = 14.03 m / 0.30 m/s = 46.77 seconds
  - Extremely high TTC implies a negligible collision risk based on current speed.

- **Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC)**:
  - The current distance is the MDC since it is closing slowly, and the lateral distance is already aligned.
  - MDC = 14.03 m

- **Risk Assessment**:
  - With a longitudinal distance of 14.03 m and a negligible closing rate, it interprets as negligible or low risk.
  - Risk Score: 5 (Negligible Risk)

**Obstacle 30598**
- **Position**: Behind the ego vehicle
- **Adjusted Distances**: Longitudinal = -13.34 m, Lateral = 0.00 m
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal = 2.91 m/s (closing), Lateral = -0.29 m/s
- **Trajectory and Motion**: The obstacle is behind, moving towards the ego vehicle with rapidly increasing relative speed, suggesting its approach.

- **Time-to-Collision (TTC) Calculation**:
  - Longitudinal direction is critical.
  - TTC = 13.34 m / 2.91 m/s = 4.58 seconds

- **Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC)**:
  - Since the trajectory is closing longitudinally at a considerable pace, the adjusted distance becomes MDC.
  - MDC = 0 m if trajectorial alignment approaches, but here MDC = ~13.34 m with continuous analysis.

- **Risk Assessment**:
  - A TTC of 4.58 seconds indicates a low to medium risk, as it's relatively close but not imminent given the distance.
  - Given closing speed and alignment, quick reaction advisable.
  - Risk Score: 4 (Low Risk)

**Summary**: 
- Obstacle 30597 presents negligible risk, with a very safe distance and no fast approach.
- Obstacle 30598 presents a low risk; although approaching quickly from behind, there is sufficient distance and time for the ego vehicle to react accordingly.
