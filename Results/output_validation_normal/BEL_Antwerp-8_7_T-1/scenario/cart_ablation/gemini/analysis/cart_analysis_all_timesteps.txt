At t=0.9s, Ego (30595.0) is at (352.2857, 549.6251) in lanelet 195.0.

Obstacle 30597.0 is at (360.7739, 533.1008) in lanelet 1046.0. This obstacle has moved to a different lanelet and poses no immediate risk.

Obstacle 30598.0 is at (345.4857, 566.1252) in lanelet 195.0.  While in the same lanelet, the y-coordinate difference suggests a longitudinal separation, and the x-coordinate difference is small but increasing.  Given the decelerations of both Ego and Obstacle 30598.0 over the past few timesteps, an extreme risk is unlikely.  This would require further analysis with more future timesteps to confirm if a risk exists due to the continuous decelerations.  For now, based on the current data, it's not an immediate extreme risk.

    "IsCollisionScenario": false,
    "Reasoning": "No obstacle presents an immediate collision risk at t=0.9s. Although Obstacle 30598.0 is in the same lanelet and relatively close, current data suggests sufficient separation."
