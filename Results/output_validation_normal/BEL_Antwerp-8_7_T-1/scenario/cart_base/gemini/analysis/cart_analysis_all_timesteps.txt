At t=0.9s, Ego (30595.0) is at (352.2857, 549.6251) in lanelet 195.0.

Obstacle 30597.0 is at (360.7739, 533.1008) in lanelet 1046.0.  This obstacle has been moving away from the ego vehicle and is now in a different lanelet, posing no immediate risk.

Obstacle 30598.0 is at (345.4857, 566.1252) in lanelet 195.0. While in the same lanelet, the y-coordinate difference suggests a longitudinal separation.  However, the x-coordinate difference is small (approximately 7 meters) indicating proximity. Considering the rapid deceleration of this obstacle (-3.7658 m/sÂ²), there is a high risk of collision in the next few timesteps if this trend continues. This classifies as an extreme risk.
