### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 30597.0
- Distance Risk reason: This obstacle is in a different lanelet (1046.0) than the ego vehicle (195.0) at the most recent timestep (0.9 seconds).  While its X position places it somewhat near the ego vehicle, the lane difference significantly reduces the risk of collision.  The historical data shows consistent movement in a separate lane.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: The obstacle's velocity and acceleration do not pose an immediate threat due to lane separation.  The history shows a slightly decreasing velocity.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 30598.0
- Distance Risk reason: Although this obstacle is in the same lanelet (195.0) as the ego vehicle, it maintains a longitudinal separation of roughly 7 meters over the observed time period. The history shows a roughly constant longitudinal distance.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason:  The obstacle's velocity is similar to the ego vehicle's. Although the obstacle exhibits some fluctuation in acceleration, it does not appear to represent an imminent threat.  The history shows initially similar velocities, with the ego vehicle then slowing down more rapidly than the obstacle vehicle.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4



### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. **Most critical obstacle:** Obstacle 30598.0 presents the most risk because it shares the same lanelet as the ego vehicle. Obstacle 30597.0 is in a different lanelet and presents negligible risk.
2. **Trajectory Analysis (All 10 Timesteps):**
    - Ego: The ego vehicle exhibits consistent braking (negative acceleration), resulting in a decrease in velocity over time. The orientation remains relatively stable within lane 195.0.
    - Obstacle 30597.0: It travels in lanelet 1046.0, a different lanelet than the ego vehicle. Its trajectory doesn't intersect with the ego vehicle's.
    - Obstacle 30598.0: Remains in lane 195.0, the same as the ego vehicle.  It initially travels faster than the ego vehicle, but slows down more slowly than the ego vehicle. The longitudinal distance between the ego vehicle and obstacle vehicle is roughly constant throughout.
3. **Relative Positions, Velocities, and Accelerations:** The greatest potential for collision exists with obstacle 30598.0 due to its proximity in the same lane. However, the longitudinal distance remains relatively constant. Both vehicles are slowing down. The ego vehicle's negative acceleration suggests an active attempt to increase its distance from the obstacle or maintain a safe following distance.
4. **Collision Determination:** Based on the provided data, no collision has occurred or is immediately imminent.
5. **Reasoning:** While obstacle 30598.0 shares the same lane, the consistent separation and the ego vehicle's braking behavior suggest a controlled situation.  There is no indication of a potential collision in the near future based on the current trends.
