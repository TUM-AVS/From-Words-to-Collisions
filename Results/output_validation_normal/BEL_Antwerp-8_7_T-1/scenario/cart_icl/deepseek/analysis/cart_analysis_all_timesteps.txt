### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep:

### Obstacle Analysis:

#### Obstacle ID: 30597.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is in lanelet 1046.0, while the ego vehicle is in lanelet 195.0. The positions over time show the obstacle is moving away from the ego vehicle (X-coordinate increasing, Y-coordinate decreasing). The current distance is ~8.2m (Ego: (352.2857, 549.6251), Obstacle: (360.7739, 533.1008)).
- **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
- **Time Risk reason**: The obstacle's velocity (5.3541 m/s) is slightly lower than the ego's (5.6293 m/s), and both are decelerating. The relative velocity is small (~0.275 m/s), but the distance is increasing.
- **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
- **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low Risk)

#### Obstacle ID: 30598.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is in the same lanelet (195.0) as the ego vehicle. The positions over time show the obstacle is moving towards the ego vehicle (Y-coordinate decreasing). The current distance is ~6.5m (Ego: (352.2857, 549.6251), Obstacle: (345.4857, 566.1252)).
- **Distance safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk)
- **Time Risk reason**: The obstacle's velocity (8.5477 m/s) is higher than the ego's (5.6293 m/s), but it is decelerating sharply (-3.7658 m/sÂ²). The relative velocity is ~2.918 m/s, and the distance is closing but deceleration may mitigate risk.
- **Time safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk)
- **Overall Risk score**: 3 (Medium Risk)

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. **Obstacle 30597.0**: Not in the same lanelet and moving away. Low risk.
2. **Obstacle 30598.0**: In the same lanelet and approaching, but decelerating. Medium risk.
3. No immediate collision or extreme risk observed in the most recent timestep.
4. Historical trends show no signs of imminent collision.
