- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 30593.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is far from ego vehicle and in a different lanelet. No risk observed in the provided trajectory.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Obstacle is moving slower than ego vehicle and decelerating further.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 30594.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is in a different lanelet and poses no immediate threat.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason:  Although moving with a similar speed as the ego vehicle initially, the trajectory shows no sign of convergence.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 30596.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is significantly far from ego vehicle and in a different lanelet.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Although moving at a similar speed, trajectories diverge.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 30597.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is moderately far from the ego vehicle, but in the same lanelet initially, then moves to a different lanelet.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Obstacle is moving somewhat slower than ego vehicle and decelerating, diverging from ego vehicle's path.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- Obstacle ID: 30598.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is in the same lanelet as ego vehicle, but sufficiently far behind.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Obstacle is moving with similar speed as ego vehicle, but trajectory shows no immediate convergence or risk.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- Obstacle ID: 30599.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is in a different lanelet and not on a collision course.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Obstacle's speed and trajectory do not pose a threat.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 30600.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is far from ego vehicle and in a different lanelet.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason:  Trajectory and speed don't indicate any risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
Based on the provided trajectories and relative positions/velocities at each timestep, no obstacle poses an immediate collision risk. The ego vehicle maintains a safe distance from all obstacles, and their trajectories suggest no imminent convergence. Therefore, this is not a collision scenario.
