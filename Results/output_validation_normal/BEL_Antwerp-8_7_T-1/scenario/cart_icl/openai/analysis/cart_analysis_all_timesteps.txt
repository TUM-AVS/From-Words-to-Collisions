### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep:
Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:
- **Obstacle ID: 30592**
  - **Distance Risk Reason**: This obstacle has remained stationary in lanelet 197. Its position hasn't changed, so no immediate trajectory intersecting with the ego vehicle is apparent.
  - **Distance Safety Score**: 5
  - **Time Risk Reason**: It has zero velocity indicating it's stationary with no sign of entering the ego vehicle's lane.
  - **Time Safety Score**: 5
  - **Overall Risk Score**: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 30593**
  - **Distance Risk Reason**: Positioned further out in lanelet 197. The distance has been reducing slowly but remains substantial for the timeframe.
  - **Distance Safety Score**: 3
  - **Time Risk Reason**: Moderate velocity and reducing acceleration indicate a reserved approach, but it's on a probable gradual convergence path with the ego vehicle.
  - **Time Safety Score**: 3
  - **Overall Risk Score**: 3

- **Obstacle ID: 30594**
  - **Distance Risk Reason**: It is in lanelet 268 and at a consistent healthy distance from the ego vehicle. Movements suggest it's on a parallel path.
  - **Distance Safety Score**: 5
  - **Time Risk Reason**: Maintaining speed and showing minor fluctuation suggests relative stability alongside the ego vehicle.
  - **Time Safety Score**: 5
  - **Overall Risk Score**: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 30596**
  - **Distance Risk Reason**: This obstacle is maintaining its distance significantly further away in lanelet 266.
  - **Distance Safety Score**: 5
  - **Time Risk Reason**: Constant velocity with minor adherence in motion path well away from the ego vehicle trajectory.
  - **Time Safety Score**: 5
  - **Overall Risk Score**: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 30597**
  - **Distance Risk Reason**: In lanelet 1046 with a pattern indicating a steady movement that is currently far from the ego vehicle. No collision approach perceived.
  - **Distance Safety Score**: 4
  - **Time Risk Reason**: Though velocity has been decreasing, it trends steadily with relatively safe deviation aligning away from ego positioning.
  - **Time Safety Score**: 4
  - **Overall Risk Score**: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 30598**
  - **Distance Risk Reason**: Previously closing in lanelet 195 with the ego vehicle, but last positions show a divergence of paths.
  - **Distance Safety Score**: 4
  - **Time Risk Reason**: Originally an overlapping trajectory; now, a clearer deviation apparent, easing imminent collision risk.
  - **Time Safety Score**: 4
  - **Overall Risk Score**: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 30599**
  - **Distance Risk Reason**: Continuously further from the ego path and within the expected range of lanelet 268 without interfering tendencies.
  - **Distance Safety Score**: 5
  - **Time Risk Reason**: The velocity adjustments showcase a control running tandem yet independent of ego vehicle influence.
  - **Time Safety Score**: 5
  - **Overall Risk Score**: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 30600**
  - **Distance Risk Reason**: In lanelet 266 with substantial separation maintained and further away from the ego vehicle direction.
  - **Distance Safety Score**: 5
  - **Time Risk Reason**: Consistently moving clear of ego trajectory and sustaining a safe path.
  - **Time Safety Score**: 5
  - **Overall Risk Score**: 5

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
After careful analysis of each obstacle's path and velocity, it's evident there is no present collision scenario. Obstacle 30598 briefly shared a lanelet path with the ego vehicle, but a divergence was noted reducing collision risk. Other obstacles show sufficient separation in lanelets or directional paths that mitigate immediate risks.
