Obstacle 30598 is approaching the ego vehicle from behind at a high relative longitudinal velocity (2.91 m/s) and is relatively close (13.34 m). While not an immediate collision, the rapid closing speed and the fact that relative longitudinal distance is decreasing with every timestep suggests a potential for collision if the ego vehicle were to brake suddenly or if obstacle 30598 continues to accelerate.  The lateral movement is minimal and not a primary concern. Obstacle 30597 is moving away from the ego vehicle laterally and slowly longitudinally. It poses no immediate risk.
