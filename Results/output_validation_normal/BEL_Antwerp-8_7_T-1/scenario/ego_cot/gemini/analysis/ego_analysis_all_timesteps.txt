### Safety analysis for timestep 0.9 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

**Assumptions and Clarifications:**

* Since "adjusted distances" are mentioned as critical but not provided, the analysis will be performed using the provided `real distance` values (DTClong, DTClat).  The lack of adjusted distances and vehicle dimensions introduces uncertainty in the true safety margins.
* TTC calculations assume constant velocity. This is a simplification, and real-world scenarios involve changing accelerations.
* A combined TTC and distance-based approach is used for risk assessment.

### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 30597**
- **Distance Risk reason:** Obstacle is in front of the ego vehicle at a longitudinal distance of 14.03m and a lateral distance of 14.03m. The exact lateral alignment is unknown, suggesting a possible crossing path if the ego vehicle were to continue straight.
- **Distance safety score:** 4 (Low Risk)
- **Time Risk reason:** The longitudinal relative velocity is -0.30 m/s, meaning the obstacle is slowly approaching the ego vehicle. Assuming constant velocity, the TTClong would be approximately 46.76 seconds (14.03m / 0.30m/s). The small negative relative longitudinal velocity and considerable distance suggest a low immediate risk, but the continued approach needs monitoring.  The lateral relative velocity is 0.46 m/s, and TTClat would be approximately 30.5 seconds (14.03 / 0.46 m/s).
- **Time safety score:** 4 (Low Risk)
- **Overall Risk score:** 4 (Low Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 30598**
- **Distance Risk reason:** Obstacle is behind the ego vehicle at a longitudinal distance of -13.34m and a lateral distance of -13.34m. While behind, the negative distances and "driving toward the ego car from behind" motion description indicate the obstacle is approaching.  The exact lateral alignment is unknown, which adds uncertainty to the risk.
- **Distance safety score:** 4 (Low Risk)
- **Time Risk reason:** The longitudinal relative velocity is 2.91 m/s, indicating the obstacle is closing the distance quickly. Assuming constant velocity, TTClong would be approximately 4.58 seconds (13.34 / 2.91 m/s). This relatively short time to collision in the rear, combined with lateral movement, presents a higher risk than the obstacle in front. The lateral relative velocity is -0.29m/s, resulting in a TTClat of approximately 46 seconds.
- **Time safety score:** 3 (Medium Risk)
- **Overall Risk score:** 3 (Medium Risk)
