### Obstacle-by-Obstacle Analysis (Most Recent Timestep: 0.9s)

#### **Obstacle 30597 (Front)**
- **Adjusted Distance**: Longitudinal 14.03m, Lateral 0.00m  
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal -0.30 m/s (approaching), Lateral 0.46 m/s (moving slightly away)  
- **Motion**: Driving toward ego longitudinally but with very low closing speed (-0.30 m/s). Laterally aligned but drifting away (0.46 m/s).  
- **TTC (Longitudinal)**:  
  - Distance = 14.03m, |Relative Velocity| = 0.30 m/s → **TTC = 14.03 / 0.30 ≈ 46.77s** (No Risk, TTC > 5s).  
- **MDC (Lateral)**:  
  - Lateral distance is stable/increasing (0.46 m/s away) → **MDC > 5.0m** (No Risk).  
- **Overall Risk**: **5 (No Risk)**.  

#### **Obstacle 30598 (Behind)**
- **Adjusted Distance**: Longitudinal -13.34m, Lateral 0.00m  
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal 2.91 m/s (approaching rapidly), Lateral -0.29 m/s (minor drift).  
- **Motion**: Driving toward ego from behind with increasing speed (acceleration trend from prior timesteps).  
- **TTC (Longitudinal)**:  
  - Distance = 13.34m, |Relative Velocity| = 2.91 m/s → **TTC = 13.34 / 2.91 ≈ 4.58s** (Low Risk, TTC just below 5s).  
- **MDC (Lateral)**:  
  - Lateral distance stable (0.00m alignment, minor drift) → **MDC ≈ 0.00m but not closing** (monitor).  
- **Overall Risk**: **4 (Low Risk)** due to TTC nearing 5s threshold, but no imminent collision.  

---

### Trajectory Analysis
- **Obstacle 30597**: Slowly closing longitudinal gap but with negligible risk (TTC extremely high). Lateral drift reduces risk further.  
- **Obstacle 30598**: Rapidly approaching from behind (TTC decreasing from 5s to 4.58s in 0.9s). If acceleration continues, TTC could drop to Medium Risk soon.  

---

### Final Determination  
- **No obstacles** meet collision (0) or extreme risk (1) criteria.  
- Highest risk is **Low Risk (4)** for Obstacle 30598 due to longitudinal TTC ≈ 4.58s.
