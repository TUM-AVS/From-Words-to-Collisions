## Obstacle Analysis

### Obstacle 30597 (In Front)
- **Most Recent Data (0.9 seconds):**
  - Adjusted Longitudinal Distance: 14.03 meters
  - Adjusted Lateral Distance: 0.00 meters (exact alignment)
  - Relative Velocity: Longitudinal -0.30 m/s (approaching), Lateral 0.46 m/s (moving away)
  - Relative Acceleration: Longitudinal -0.15 m/s², Lateral 0.02 m/s²

- **Trajectory Analysis:**
  - This obstacle is aligned longitudinally and is moving toward the ego vehicle with a slight decrease in approach speed, as denoted by the negative acceleration.
  - Lateral movement is diverging slightly, indicating a lateral alignment but a slight positional change over time.

- **TTC Calculation:**
  - Longitudinal TTC = 14.03 m / |0.30 m/s| = 46.77 seconds
  - Lateral movement is divergent.

- **MDC Analysis:**
  - Longitudinal MDC: 14.03 meters
  - Lateral MDC: 14.03 meters (given longitudinal alignment and no direct lateral intersection, de facto MDC limits risk)

- **Risk Assessment:**
  - Based on both TTC and MDC, no imminent collision risk.
  - **Risk Score:** 5 (No Risk)

### Obstacle 30598 (Behind)
- **Most Recent Data (0.9 seconds):**
  - Adjusted Longitudinal Distance: -13.34 meters (behind)
  - Adjusted Lateral Distance: 0.00 meters (exact alignment)
  - Relative Velocity: Longitudinal 2.91 m/s (approaching), Lateral -0.29 m/s (very slow relative movement)
  - Relative Acceleration: Longitudinal -0.82 m/s², Lateral 2.20 m/s²

- **Trajectory Analysis:**
  - This obstacle is catching up to the ego vehicle rapidly from behind, as shown by positive longitudinal velocity and consolidation with slight variance in lateral velocity.

- **TTC Calculation:**
  - Longitudinal TTC = -13.34 m / 2.91 m/s = 4.58 seconds 

- **MDC Analysis:**
  - Longitudinal MDC based on consistent approach: |13.34 meters| is current threshold.

- **Risk Assessment:**
  - Considering continuous convergence and acceleration, risk level is evaluated using projected trajectory.
  - **Risk Score:** 3 (Medium Risk)

## Final Collision Scenario Determination
- No obstacles with a risk score of 0 or 1 were identified.
- Therefore, not considered a collision scenario presently, despite rapid approach from behind.
