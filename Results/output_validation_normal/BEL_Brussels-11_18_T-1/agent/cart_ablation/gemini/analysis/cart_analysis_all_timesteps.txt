Obstacle 30261 is consistently near the ego vehicle and its y-coordinate is approaching the ego vehicle's y-coordinate. Initially, obstacle 30261's x-coordinate is greater than the ego vehicle's, but over time, the difference decreases.  From 0.4 seconds onwards, the acceleration of obstacle 30261 becomes highly negative, suggesting heavy braking or a potential error in the data. This erratic behavior and proximity makes it a high-risk obstacle. The other obstacles are relatively far and don't pose an immediate threat.  However, continuous monitoring is necessary.
