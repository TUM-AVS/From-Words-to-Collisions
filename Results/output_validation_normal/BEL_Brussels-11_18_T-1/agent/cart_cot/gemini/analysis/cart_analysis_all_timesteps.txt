At t=0.9s, the ego vehicle is at (21.35, -88.5623) with a velocity of 5.216 and acceleration of 0.55.  Let's analyze the risk posed by each obstacle at this timestep, considering their trajectories from previous timesteps.

**Obstacle 30257:** Position (28.1754, -112.9729), velocity 9.2273, acceleration -0.8206. This obstacle is significantly far from the ego vehicle in both x and y coordinates and poses no immediate threat.  Based on its trajectory, it's unlikely to intersect the ego vehicle's path in the near future.

**Obstacle 30258:** Position (17.3556, -104.2673), velocity 8.2949, acceleration 0.0323. While the x-coordinate is relatively close to the ego vehicle, the y-coordinate shows a considerable separation. The trajectories from prior timesteps indicate this obstacle is moving roughly parallel to the ego vehicle but with a greater negative y-velocity, increasing the separation distance.

**Obstacle 30259:**  No data is available for obstacle 30259 at t=0.9s.  We cannot assess its risk without this information.

**Obstacle 30260:** Position (13.1518, -100.7109), velocity 8.3318, acceleration 0.7606.  Similar to obstacle 30258, this obstacle is closer in the x-coordinate but significantly further in the y-coordinate compared to the ego vehicle. Its trajectory suggests a movement path parallel to the ego vehicle but with slightly less negative y-velocity, potentially resulting in a gradual increase in separation distance.

**Obstacle 30261:** Position (23.5497, -91.5803), velocity 4.5813, acceleration -5.5193. This obstacle is the closest to the ego vehicle in the recent timestep. The x-coordinate is near the ego vehicle's, and the difference in y-coordinates is also comparatively smaller than other obstacles. However, analysis of prior timestamps shows that obstacle 30261 is moving with a less negative y-velocity than the ego vehicle. Considering its deceleration, the risk is manageable but requires careful monitoring. This indicates a potential risk level score in the 2 or 3.


**Summary:**

Based on the available data at t=0.9s, no obstacle poses an immediate collision risk (score 0) or extreme risk (score 1). Obstacle 30261 represents the highest potential risk due to its proximity and relative motion, warranting a risk score of 2 or 3. No obstacle warrants a risk level of 0 or 1. Due to the lack of information about obstacle 30259 at this timestep, we cannot conclusively assess its risk.
