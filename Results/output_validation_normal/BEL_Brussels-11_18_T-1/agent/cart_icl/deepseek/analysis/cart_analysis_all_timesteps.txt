### Analysis:

1. **Obstacle 30261 (ID: 30261)**:
   - **Position**: (23.5497, -91.5803) at 0.9s, moving towards the ego vehicle.
   - **Relative Motion**: The ego is at (21.35, -88.5623), and the obstacle is approaching from the rear-left.
   - **TTC**: The relative longitudinal distance is ~3.02m, and the relative velocity is ~0.6347 m/s (ego: 5.216 m/s, obstacle: 4.5813 m/s). TTC ≈ 3.02 / 0.6347 ≈ 4.76s.
   - **MDC**: Lateral distance is significant (~3m), but the obstacle is decelerating sharply (-5.5193 m/s²).
   - **Risk**: **Low (4)** due to sufficient TTC and lateral separation.

2. **Obstacle 30260 (ID: 30260)**:
   - **Position**: (13.1518, -100.7109) at 0.9s, moving away from the ego vehicle.
   - **Relative Motion**: The obstacle is far ahead and laterally separated (~12m lateral distance).
   - **Risk**: **Negligible (5)**.

3. **Obstacle 30258 (ID: 30258)**:
   - **Position**: (17.3556, -104.2673) at 0.9s, moving away from the ego vehicle.
   - **Relative Motion**: The obstacle is far ahead and laterally separated (~15m lateral distance).
   - **Risk**: **Negligible (5)**.

4. **Obstacle 30257 (ID: 30257)**:
   - **Position**: (28.1754, -112.9729) at 0.9s, moving away from the ego vehicle.
   - **Relative Motion**: The obstacle is far ahead and laterally separated (~28m lateral distance).
   - **Risk**: **Negligible (5)**.

5. **Obstacle 30259 (ID: 30259)**:
   - **Position**: Not present at 0.9s (last seen at 0.8s).
   - **Risk**: **Negligible (5)** if no longer in the scene.
