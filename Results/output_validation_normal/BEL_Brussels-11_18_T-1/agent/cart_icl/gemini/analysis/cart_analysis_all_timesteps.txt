At t=0.9s, the ego vehicle at (21.35, -88.56) maintains a safe distance from most obstacles. Obstacle 30261, located at (23.55, -91.58), is the closest, but poses no immediate threat due to its lateral offset and the ego's decelerating motion trend.  Other obstacles are significantly further away and in different lanelets, presenting negligible risk.  Obstacle 30259 is not present in this timestep, suggesting it may have left the scene or its tracking was lost.
