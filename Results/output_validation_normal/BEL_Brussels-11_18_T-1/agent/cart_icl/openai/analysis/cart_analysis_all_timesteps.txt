### Analysis

For this scenario, let's analyze the most recent timestep where the obstacles and ego vehicle positions are at 0.9 seconds. We'll focus on the relative position, velocity, and trajectory of each obstacle compared to the ego vehicle.

**Ego Vehicle at 0.9 seconds:**
- Position: (21.35, -88.5623)
- Lanelet: 1759.0
- Velocity: 5.216 m/s

**Analyzing Obstacles:**

1. **Obstacle 30257:**
   - Position: (28.1754, -112.9729)
   - Lanelet: 499.0 (different)
   - The lateral separation between the ego and this obstacle's lanelet indicates no immediate risk.
   - Relative position (longitudinal): Approximately 24.41 meters away in a different lane.
   - Overall Risk Score: 5 (Negligible Risk, due to significant lateral separation).

2. **Obstacle 30258:**
   - Position: (17.3556, -104.2673)
   - Lanelet: 1760.0 (different)
   - Relative longitudinal distance indicates it is behind the ego vehicle.
   - Overall Risk Score: 4 (Low Risk, sufficient lateral and longitudinal separation).

3. **Obstacle 30260:**
   - Position: (13.1518, -100.7109)
   - Lanelet: 1762.0 (different)
   - Obstacle is significantly behind the ego vehicle with safe separation distance.
   - Overall Risk Score: 5 (Negligible Risk).

4. **Obstacle 30261:**
   - Position: (23.5497, -91.5803)
   - Lanelet: 1758.0 (adjacent)
   - Relative Position: Approximately 2.1997 longitudinal meters away, very close to the ego vehicle lane.
   - Relative Velocity: The difference in velocity (4.5813 m/s vs. 5.216 m/s) shows it is decelerating dramatically compared to the ego.
   - The obstacle is moving slower and decelerating, raising the risk. The short time gap and the approaching trajectory of obstacle 30261 indicate potential collision.
   - Overall Risk Score: 1 (Extreme Risk)

**Brief explanation for Obstacle 30261 (Overall Risk Score = 1):**
Obstacle 30261 is closely tracking alongside the ego vehicle's path and demonstrates rapid deceleration. Despite the proximity, control can be maintained by monitoring and altering the lane/path if feasible, due to adjacent lane confines. Immediate evasive actions are advisable.
