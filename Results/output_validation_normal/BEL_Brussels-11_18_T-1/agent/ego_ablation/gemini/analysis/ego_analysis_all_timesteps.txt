At t=0.9s, Obstacle 30257 is approaching ego longitudinally with a relative velocity of -5.52 m/s and a longitudinal distance of 12.10m.  While it's moving laterally away from the ego, the longitudinal approach represents a potential risk. If this trend persists, a collision might occur within the next few seconds. Thus, it constitutes a high risk. Other obstacles are moving away from the ego vehicle and don't present an immediate risk of collision.
