At t=0.9s, Obstacle 30257 is approaching the ego longitudinally at -5.52 m/s and is 12.10 meters away.  While it's moving left laterally, the longitudinal motion poses a high risk. Obstacle 30258 is less concerning longitudinally (0.99 m/s and 10.80m away), but its lateral velocity (5.50 m/s) and proximity warrant attention. Obstacle 30260 is moving away longitudinally at 3.11 m/s and is 10.15 m away, representing medium risk. Obstacle 30261 is very close laterally (1.89m) and moving towards the ego at -0.63 m/s longitudinally, which warrants a medium risk assessment due to the proximity.
