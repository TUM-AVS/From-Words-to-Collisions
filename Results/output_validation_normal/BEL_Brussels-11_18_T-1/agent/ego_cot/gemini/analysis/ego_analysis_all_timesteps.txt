### Safety analysis for timestep 0.9s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

**Assumptions and Clarifications:**

* Since adjusted distances (adjusted_d_long, adjusted_d_lat) are not provided in the scenario context, the provided real distances (DTClong, DTClat) will be used for analysis.  This is not ideal and may lead to less precise risk assessment.  You *must* provide adjusted distances for the most accurate collision risk analysis.
* TTC will be approximated using distance/relative velocity.  This is a simplification and doesn't account for acceleration, which is crucial for a more realistic TTC.  Providing the acceleration would significantly improve the analysis.  If the relative velocity is zero, TTC will be considered infinite (no immediate risk).
* Since no ego vehicle dimensions are given, precise MDC cannot be calculated. MDC will be approximated by the minimum real distance observed during the scenario.
* An Overall Risk Score is determined by taking the minimum of the Distance and Time safety scores. This is a conservative approach reflecting that a high risk in either distance or time contributes to a high overall risk.


### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 30257**
- Distance Risk reason: Relatively close longitudinally (12.10m) and moving closer. Lateral movement is away from ego, but longitudinal motion is concerning.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: Approaching ego longitudinally with negative relative velocity (-5.52 m/s) suggesting a potential collision if the trend continues.
- Time safety score: 2
- Overall Risk score: 2

- **Obstacle ID: 30258**
- Distance Risk reason: Moderately close (10.80m) but moving away laterally.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: Moving away longitudinally and laterally.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 3

- **Obstacle ID: 30260**
- Distance Risk reason: Moderately close (10.15m).
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: Moving away from the ego vehicle.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 3

- **Obstacle ID: 30261**
- Distance Risk reason:  Zero distance laterally, indicating it's directly beside the ego vehicle.
- Distance safety score: 2
- Time Risk reason: Moving away laterally. Though currently very close, the motion suggests risk is decreasing.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 2
