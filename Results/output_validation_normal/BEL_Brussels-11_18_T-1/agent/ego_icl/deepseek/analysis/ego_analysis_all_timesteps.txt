Let me analyze each obstacle at the most recent timestep (0.9 seconds):

1. Obstacle 30257 (Front-left):
   - Adjusted distances: longitudinal 12.10m, lateral 17.54m
   - Relative velocities: longitudinal -5.52 m/s (approaching), lateral 9.22 m/s (moving away)
   - TTC longitudinal: 12.10/5.52 = 2.19s (Medium Risk)
   - TTC lateral: N/A (moving away)
   - MDC: Lateral distance increasing, longitudinal distance decreasing but still large (17.54m)
   - Risk: Medium (3) based on longitudinal TTC

2. Obstacle 30258 (Front-left):
   - Adjusted distances: longitudinal 10.80m, lateral 3.71m
   - Relative velocities: longitudinal 0.99 m/s (moving away), lateral 5.50 m/s (moving away)
   - TTC: N/A (both dimensions moving away)
   - MDC: Both distances increasing
   - Risk: Negligible (5)

3. Obstacle 30260 (Front):
   - Adjusted distances: longitudinal 10.15m, lateral 0.00m
   - Relative velocities: longitudinal 3.11 m/s (moving away), lateral -0.14 m/s (negligible)
   - TTC: N/A (moving away)
   - MDC: Distance increasing
   - Risk: Negligible (5)

4. Obstacle 30261 (Left):
   - Adjusted distances: longitudinal 0.00m, lateral 1.89m
   - Relative velocities: longitudinal -0.63 m/s (approaching), lateral 0.00 m/s
   - TTC longitudinal: 0.00/0.63 = 0s (Collision Risk)
   - However, lateral distance is stable at 1.89m (safe)
   - MDC: 1.89m (Medium Risk)
   - Risk: Medium (3) - while longitudinally aligned, safe lateral distance prevents collision

Trajectory Analysis:
- Obstacle 30257 shows consistent longitudinal approach but increasing lateral distance
- Obstacle 30261 shows longitudinal alignment but stable safe lateral distance
- All other obstacles are moving away from ego vehicle

Final Risk Assessment:
- No actual collisions (distance > 0 in at least one dimension for all obstacles)
- No extreme risks (all TTC > 0.5s and MDC > 0.5m)
- Highest risk is Medium (3) for obstacles 30257 and 30261
