* **Obstacle 30257:** This obstacle is approaching the ego vehicle longitudinally while moving away laterally.  Over the observed time, the longitudinal distance decreases from 16.58m to 12.10m, while the lateral distance increases from 10.13m to 17.54m.  The negative longitudinal velocity and the increasing lateral distance indicate decreasing risk despite the closing longitudinal gap. The most recent timestep shows a longitudinal distance of 12.10m and a lateral distance of 17.54m. With a longitudinal relative velocity of -5.52 m/s and a lateral relative velocity of 9.22 m/s, TTC values are not meaningful for collision risk assessment. The MDC is greater than 5m, indicating a low collision risk. Overall Risk Score: 5 (Negligible Risk)

* **Obstacle 30258:**  This obstacle is moving away from the ego vehicle both longitudinally and laterally.  The distances increase over the observed period.  At the last timestep, the longitudinal distance is 10.80m and lateral is 3.71m. The relative velocity is positive in both directions.  Given increasing distances and relative velocities moving away from ego, TTC is not meaningful. The MDC is greater than 5m, so the risk is negligible. Overall Risk Score: 5 (Negligible Risk)

* **Obstacle 30259:** This obstacle is directly in front of the ego vehicle and is moving away. At the last timestep, it's not present. The longitudinal distance and velocity were increasing, indicating a diverging trajectory. Thus, there is no risk of collision. We will not include it in the final JSON as it is not present at the latest timestep.

* **Obstacle 30260:** This obstacle is also directly ahead and moving away. At the latest timestep the longitudinal distance is 10.15m with a positive velocity. The lateral distance remains 0.00, indicating alignment but not a collision risk given the increasing longitudinal separation. TTC calculation isn't meaningful as the obstacle is moving away from ego. MDC is greater than 5m. Overall Risk Score: 5 (Negligible Risk)


* **Obstacle 30261:** This obstacle maintains a constant lateral distance of 1.89m, though the longitudinal distance is 0 indicating it's alongside the ego vehicle longitudinally, and moving away laterally, according to the motion description. Lateral relative velocity -0.63 m/s implies it is moving away from the ego vehicle laterally, decreasing risk.  TTC is not meaningful due to negative or zero relative velocity. Given the lateral separation and movement, MDC is also above 5m, suggesting low risk. Overall Risk Score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
