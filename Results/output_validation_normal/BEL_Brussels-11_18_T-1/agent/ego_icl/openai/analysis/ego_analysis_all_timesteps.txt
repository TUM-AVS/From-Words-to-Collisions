### Obstacle Analysis

**Obstacle 30257**  
- **Direction**: Front-left  
- **Most Recent Distances**: Longitudinal 12.10m, Lateral 17.54m  
- **Velocity**: Longitudinal -5.52 m/s (approaching), Lateral 9.22 m/s (moving away)  
- **Trajectory Insight**: Obstacle is consistently moving toward the ego vehicle longitudinally and moving away laterally.
- **TTC Longitudinal**: |12.10 / 5.52| â‰ˆ 2.19 seconds  
- **MDC**: Considering the longitudinal closing and moderate lateral distance: Both directions show no immediate proximity concern.
- **Risk**: Medium Risk (Score 3) due to longitudinal closure.  
  - Primarily medium due to sufficient time to react longitudinally, and lateral diverging reduces immediate threat.  

**Obstacle 30258**  
- **Direction**: Front-left  
- **Most Recent Distances**: Longitudinal 10.80m, Lateral 3.71m  
- **Velocity**: Longitudinal 0.99 m/s (moving away), Lateral 5.50 m/s (moving away)  
- **Trajectory Insight**: The obstacle is diverging in both dimensions over time.
- **TTC and MDC**: Not applicable as the obstacle is moving away in both dimensions.
- **Risk**: Negligible Risk (Score 5) due to non-converging trajectories.  

**Obstacle 30260**  
- **Direction**: Front  
- **Most Recent Distances**: Longitudinal 10.15m, Lateral 0.00m  
- **Velocity**: Longitudinal 3.11 m/s (moving away), Lateral -0.14 m/s (negligible)  
- **Trajectory Insight**: Obstacle moving away longitudinally.
- **TTC and MDC**: N/A because the obstacle is moving away longitudinally.
- **Risk**: Negligible Risk (Score 5).  

**Obstacle 30261**  
- **Direction**: Left  
- **Most Recent Distances**: Longitudinal 0.00m, Lateral 1.89m  
- **Velocity**: Longitudinal -0.63 m/s (moving away), Lateral 0.00 m/s (stationary)  
- **Trajectory Insight**: Obstacle is not closing in.
- **TTC and MDC**: Not applicable as obstacle is moving laterally.  
- **Risk**: Negligible Risk (Score 5) because of stable trajectories.

### Summary
- **Obstacle 30257** poses a Medium Risk primarily in the longitudinal direction, although the lateral separation reduces the overall threat.
- All other obstacles are assessed to have negligible risk due to their divergent paths or substantial distances and trajectories away from the ego vehicle.
