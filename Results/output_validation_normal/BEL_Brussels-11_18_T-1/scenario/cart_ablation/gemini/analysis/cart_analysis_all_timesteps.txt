At t=0.9s, Ego is in lanelet 1759. Obstacle 30261 is in lanelet 1758 and is the closest obstacle. While the distance between Ego and Obstacle 30261 has been decreasing over the previous timesteps, at t=0.9s, Obstacle 30261's position is (23.5497, -91.5803) and Ego's is (21.35, -88.5623).  This translates to a distance of approximately 3.02 units. Given the current velocities and accelerations, a collision is not imminent in the next immediate timestep. No other obstacles are in close proximity to Ego. Therefore, no obstacle presents a collision or extreme risk.
