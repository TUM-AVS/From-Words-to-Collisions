At t=0.9s, Ego is in lanelet 1759 with a velocity of 5.216 m/s and decelerating.

Obstacle 30261 is in lanelet 1758, also decelerating rapidly.  While the lanelets suggest they might be adjacent, the y-coordinates of Ego (-88.5623) and Obstacle 30261 (-91.5803) show a significant lateral separation, reducing the risk. The x-coordinates (21.35 vs 23.5497) show that Obstacle 30261 is slightly ahead of the Ego vehicle.  Given the trends, a collision appears unlikely in the immediate future.

No other obstacles are in close proximity or exhibit trajectories suggesting immediate collision risk.

    "Reasoning": "No obstacles pose an immediate collision risk at t=0.9s. Although Obstacle 30261 is in a potentially adjacent lanelet and both vehicles are decelerating, their lateral separation is significant, and Obstacle 30261 is slightly ahead, making a near-term collision unlikely."
