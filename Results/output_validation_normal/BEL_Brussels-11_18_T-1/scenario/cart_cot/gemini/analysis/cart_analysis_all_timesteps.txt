### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 30257.0
- Distance Risk reason: This obstacle is far from the ego vehicle and moving further away based on its trajectory over the past timesteps.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: The relative velocities and accelerations suggest no risk of collision in the foreseeable future.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5
- Obstacle ID: 30258.0
- Distance Risk reason:  While this obstacle is at a moderate distance, its trajectory over the past timesteps shows it moving further away from the ego vehicle.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: The relative velocities and accelerations don't indicate an immediate threat.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4
- Obstacle ID: 30259.0

- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4
- Obstacle ID: 30261.0
- Distance Risk reason: This obstacle is the closest to the ego vehicle, but its trajectory shows a diverging path.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: Though the obstacle is relatively close, its velocity and acceleration indicate movement away from the ego vehicle.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. **Most critical obstacle:** Obstacle 30261.0 is the closest, requiring careful observation even if the risk is not immediate.
2. **Trajectory analysis:** Over the 10 timesteps, all obstacles maintain distinct trajectories that do not intersect with the ego vehicle's path.
3. **Relative motion:**  Relative velocities and accelerations between the ego and all obstacles reinforce the notion of diverging or non-intersecting paths.
4. **Collision assessment:** No collision has occurred, and based on the observed data, no collision is imminent.
5. **Reasoning:** The analysis of past positions confirms that all obstacles are moving on trajectories that do not pose a collision risk to the ego vehicle. The consistent relative velocities and accelerations support this conclusion.
