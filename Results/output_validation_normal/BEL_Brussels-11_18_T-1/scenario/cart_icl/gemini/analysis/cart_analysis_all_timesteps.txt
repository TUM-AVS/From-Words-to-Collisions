### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 30257.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is far from ego and moving away.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: No time-based risk due to large distance and diverging paths.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 30258.0
- Distance Risk reason:  Obstacle is relatively far and poses no immediate threat.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason:  The obstacle's trajectory and ego's decelerating behavior warrant monitoring, but no immediate time-based risk.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- Obstacle ID: 30259.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is far from ego and poses no immediate threat.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: No time-based risk due to distance.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 30260.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is moderately far from the ego vehicle.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason:  No immediate time-based risk, but requires monitoring due to its proximity and the ego vehicle's deceleration.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- Obstacle ID: 30261.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is in the same lanelet as Ego, but relatively far.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: Both vehicles are moving in similar direction but obstacle is decelerating rapidly, decreasing risk.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3

- Obstacle ID: 30262.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is far and in a different lane.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason:  No time risk due to distance and differing lanes/trajectories.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 30264.0
- Distance Risk reason: Far from ego and moving away.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: No time-based risk due to diverging trajectories.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
No obstacle poses an immediate collision risk.  Obstacle 30261 is in the same lanelet and closest to the ego vehicle, requiring attention. However, given the current trajectories and the obstacle's deceleration, a collision is unlikely in the immediate future. Therefore, this is not a collision scenario.
