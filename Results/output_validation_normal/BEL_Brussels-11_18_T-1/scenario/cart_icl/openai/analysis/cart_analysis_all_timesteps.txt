### Obstacle Analysis:

#### Obstacle 30257
- **Distance Risk Reason:** Positioned in a different lanelet (499.0) with no convergence towards the ego vehicle's path, indicating divergence.
- **Distance Safety Score:** 5
- **Time Risk Reason:** Consistent high velocity but diverging path and position do not threaten the ego vehicle.
- **Time Safety Score:** 5
- **Overall Risk Score:** 5

#### Obstacle 30258
- **Distance Risk Reason:** Moving in a different lanelet (1760.0 initially 770.0), with trajectory showing no crossing into the ego's path.
- **Distance Safety Score:** 5
- **Time Risk Reason:** Similar high but diverging velocity trends observed over time.
- **Time Safety Score:** 5
- **Overall Risk Score:** 5

#### Obstacle 30259
- **Distance Risk Reason:** Considerable distance and different lanelet (1260.0) from ego vehicle; no trajectory convergence.
- **Distance Safety Score:** 5
- **Time Risk Reason:** Consistent with high velocity, positioning does not induce collision risk.
- **Time Safety Score:** 5
- **Overall Risk Score:** 5

#### Obstacle 30260
- **Distance Risk Reason:** Situated in a different lanelet (1762.0) and trajectory showing parallel movement resulting in a non-interfering path.
- **Distance Safety Score:** 5
- **Time Risk Reason:** Demonstrates consistent motion away from ego's trajectory.
- **Time Safety Score:** 5
- **Overall Risk Score:** 5

#### Obstacle 30261
- **Distance Risk Reason:** Similar lanelet (1758.0) trajectory deviating from the direct path of ego, moving away.
- **Distance Safety Score:** 4
- **Time Risk Reason:** Significant negative acceleration indicates reducing potential threat.
- **Time Safety Score:** 4
- **Overall Risk Score:** 4

#### Obstacle 30262
- **Distance Risk Reason:** Positioned in a lateral lanelet (558.0), existing trajectory does not indicate an intersection.
- **Distance Safety Score:** 5
- **Time Risk Reason:** Maintaining stable distance with no crossing path.
- **Time Safety Score:** 5
- **Overall Risk Score:** 5

#### Obstacle 30264
- **Distance Risk Reason:** Sustained different lanelet (767.0) does not intersect the ego vehicle's path.
- **Distance Safety Score:** 5
- **Time Risk Reason:** High velocity but path orientation and acceleration indicate away movement from ego trajectory.
- **Time Safety Score:** 5
- **Overall Risk Score:** 5

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis
Given all obstacles exhibit trajectories and velocities directing away from the ego vehicle, no collision scenarios or extreme risk scenarios are present.
