Obstacle 30257 shows a concerning longitudinal approach (-5.52 m/s) while laterally moving away (9.22 m/s).  At 12.10 meters longitudinal distance, this obstacle warrants close monitoring. However, with a lateral distance of 17.54 meters and increasing, the immediate risk appears low.

Obstacle 30258 is moving away both longitudinally (0.99 m/s) and laterally (5.50 m/s) from the ego vehicle.  With distances of 10.80m longitudinal and 3.71m lateral, this obstacle poses no immediate threat.

Obstacle 30260 is moving longitudinally away from the ego vehicle at 3.11 m/s and is at a longitudinal distance of 10.15 m, presenting minimal risk.

Obstacle 30261, while laterally close at 1.89m, is moving away laterally and does not pose a high risk of collision in this timestep.
