Obstacle 30257 is moving towards the ego vehicle longitudinally (-5.52 m/s) and is at a longitudinal distance of 12.10 meters. While it is moving laterally away from the ego car (9.22 m/s), the closing longitudinal distance makes it a potential high risk obstacle.

Obstacle 30258 is moving away longitudinally (0.99 m/s) and laterally (5.50 m/s) and presents low risk.

Obstacle 30260 is moving away longitudinally (3.11 m/s) and presents low risk.

Obstacle 30261 is stationary relative to the ego vehicle longitudinally, but moving away laterally. There is no risk of collision with this obstacle.
