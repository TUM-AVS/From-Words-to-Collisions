### Safety analysis for timestep 0.9 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 30257**
- Distance Risk reason:  Located at 12.10m longitudinally and 12.10m laterally in the front-left, indicating some proximity but not immediate danger.  The obstacle is moving towards the ego vehicle longitudinally (-5.52 m/s) but away laterally (9.22 m/s).
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Although approaching longitudinally, the lateral movement significantly reduces the risk of collision.  Precise TTC calculations would require more information, but the current trajectory suggests a low risk in the near future.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 30258**
- Distance Risk reason: Positioned at 10.80m longitudinally and 10.80m laterally in the front-left, indicating some proximity. The obstacle is moving away both longitudinally (0.99 m/s) and laterally (5.50 m/s).
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: The obstacle is moving away from the ego vehicle in both directions, reducing the risk of collision.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 30260**
- Distance Risk reason:  At 10.15m longitudinally and 10.15m laterally in front, the obstacle is relatively close. It's moving away longitudinally (3.11 m/s).
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason:  The longitudinal movement away from the ego vehicle decreases collision risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5


- **Obstacle ID: 30261**
- Distance Risk reason:  Located at 0.00m longitudinally and 0.00m laterally to the left, indicating high proximity or potential overlap due to using the raw distance instead of the adjusted distance.  However, it's moving away laterally.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: While laterally close, the obstacle is moving away from the ego vehicle laterally and therefore presents little collision risk.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
    "CollisionObstacle": null,
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null,
    "IsCollisionScenario": false,
    "Justification": "No obstacle is on a direct collision course or exhibits an extreme risk of collision in the most recent timestep. All obstacles are either moving away from the ego vehicle or are at safe distances."
