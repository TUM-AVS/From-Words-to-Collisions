* **Obstacle 30257 (Front-Left):**  This obstacle shows a concerning trend. While the lateral distance is increasing, suggesting it's moving away from the ego vehicle's lane, the longitudinal distance is consistently decreasing across all timesteps, meaning it is approaching the ego vehicle from the front. At the last timestep (0.9s), the longitudinal distance is 12.10m and closing at -5.52 m/s. This gives a TTC of 2.2 seconds (12.10/5.52).  The lateral motion makes a direct collision less likely, but the closing longitudinal distance warrants attention. The MDC, based primarily on the forward distance, places this in the Medium Risk category. The overall risk is **Medium (3)**.

* **Obstacle 30258 (Front-Left):** This obstacle is moving away from the ego vehicle both longitudinally and laterally. The last timestep shows a longitudinal distance of 10.80m with a positive velocity of 0.99m/s (moving away). This gives a large positive TTC value that is not relevant to collision risk assessment.  Lateral distance is also increasing.  The MDC and TTC both indicate **No Risk (5)**.

* **Obstacle 30259 (Front/Front-Right):** This obstacle initially appears directly in front and then slightly to the right of the ego vehicle. The longitudinal distance is consistently increasing across all timesteps, and at the latest time step it's already relatively far at over 24m (previous time step). This, along with the increasingly positive longitudinal velocity and the laterally diverging trajectory, indicates **No Risk (5)**.

* **Obstacle 30260 (Front):** This obstacle is directly in front of the ego vehicle. The longitudinal distance is consistently increasing across all timesteps, and at the latest time step is 10.15m. The positive and growing longitudinal velocity further confirms this. This translates to no imminent risk of a collision despite being longitudinally aligned with the ego vehicle. The MDC and TTC both indicate **No Risk (5)**.

* **Obstacle 30261 (Left):** This obstacle maintains near-perfect longitudinal alignment (0.00m) with the ego vehicle throughout all timesteps. The small and changing relative velocity is consistent with near-zero lateral motion. The lateral distance remains stable at 1.89m.  Despite being aligned, the lack of lateral movement and the positive relative velocity suggest that the obstacle is not converging with the ego vehicleâ€™s projected path. At the latest timestep the obstacle is moving away from the ego vehicle longitudinally (-0.63 m/s) although this velocity varies over the timesteps. The consistent lateral distance of 1.89m puts this in the Medium Risk category. The TTC calculations are not useful in this near-zero relative motion and stable-distance scenario. Overall risk is **Medium (3)** due to the close lateral proximity and longitudinal alignment, but trajectory analysis confirms that the risk is not extreme or imminent.


**Collision Scenario Determination:** No, this is not a collision scenario.  No obstacle presents an Extreme Risk (1) or Collision (0) situation at the latest timestep.
