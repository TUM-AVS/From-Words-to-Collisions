### Analysis of Obstacle Scenarios at Most Recent Timestep (0.9 seconds):

#### Obstacle 30257 (Front-left)
- **Adjusted Longitudinal Distance**: 12.10 m
- **Adjusted Lateral Distance**: 17.54 m
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal = -5.52 m/s (approaching), Lateral = 9.22 m/s (moving away)
- **Motion**: Obstacle is driving toward the ego car longitudinally and moving away laterally.

**TTC Calculation**:
- **Longitudinal TTC**: 12.10 m / 5.52 m/s = 2.19 seconds
- **Lateral direction does not converge** (moving away).

**MDC Calculation**:
- With the lateral component moving away, the main focus is longitudinal: 12.10 m.

**Risk Assessment**:
- Longitudinal TTC < 3 seconds but > 1 second → Medium Risk (3)
- Overall Risk Score: 3

#### Obstacle 30258 (Front-left)
- **Adjusted Longitudinal Distance**: 10.80 m
- **Adjusted Lateral Distance**: 3.71 m
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal = 0.99 m/s (moving away), Lateral = 5.50 m/s (moving away)
- **Motion**: Obstacle is moving away in both directions.

**TTC Calculation**:
- Longitudinal TTC: Obstacle moving away, thus no approaching TTC.
- Lateral TTC: Obst has positives also means MOVING AWAY, No Collision Risk.

**MDC Calculation**:
- Since moving away in longitudinal direction, focus on lateral distance but accelerating away.

**Risk Assessment**:
- Lateral distance > 3.0m and moving away → No Risk (5)
- Overall Risk Score: 5

#### Obstacle 30259 (Front-right)
- **Adjusted Longitudinal Distance**: 25.38 m
- **Adjusted Lateral Distance**: -0.24 m
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal = 3.16 m/s (moving away), Lateral = -1.43 m/s (moving away)
- **Motion**: Obstacle is moving away in both dimensions.

**TTC Calculation**:
- Longitudinal TTC: Moving away, thus no approach.
- Lateral: Also moving away.

**MDC Calculation**:
- Safe distance in both dimensions as it's increasing.

**Risk Assessment**:
- Very Low Risk, paths diverge → No Risk (5)
- Overall Risk Score: 5

#### Obstacle 30260 (Front)
- **Adjusted Longitudinal Distance**: 10.15 m
- **Adjusted Lateral Distance**: 0.00 m
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal = 3.11 m/s (moving away)
- **Motion**: Obstacle is moving away longitudinally with lateral alignment.

**TTC Calculation**:
- Velocity indicates movement away, no collision risk.

**MDC Calculation**:
- Lateral alignment but longitudinal distance increasing.

**Risk Assessment**:
- Longitudinal distance and moving away → No Risk (5)
- Overall Risk Score: 5

#### Obstacle 30261 (Left)
- **Adjusted Longitudinal Distance**: 0.00 m
- **Adjusted Lateral Distance**: 1.89 m
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal = -0.63 m/s, Lateral = 0.00 m/s
- **Motion**: Moving almost parallel, slight lateral alignment.

**TTC Calculation**:
- Parallel motion, no collision path detected.

**MDC Calculation**:
- Longitudinal movement not towards ego, no change laterally.

**Risk Assessment**:
- Paths are not converging → No Risk (5)
- Overall Risk Score: 5

### Determination of Collision Scenario

Given the detailed assessment of each obstacle, none meet the criteria for Collision or Extreme Risk (scores 0 or 1). Hence, there is no immediate collision scenario.
