Here's the analysis and the JSON output:

**Analysis:**

* **Obstacle 30257:** This obstacle is consistently far from the ego vehicle and moving away.  It presents a negligible risk.
* **Obstacle 30258:** This obstacle is moderately far from the ego vehicle and its trajectory doesn't appear to intersect with the ego vehicle's path in the near future. It presents a low to medium risk.
* **Obstacle 30260:** This obstacle is relatively close to the ego vehicle initially, and its deceleration is significant (-6.37 m/sÂ² consistently). While the distance between them isn't decreasing drastically in the short term (0.9 seconds), the rapid deceleration of this obstacle and its proximity warrant attention. This presents a potential high risk if the ego vehicle maintains its current course and velocity.  Requires further monitoring.
* **Obstacle 30265:** This obstacle is close to the ego vehicle and they are moving in relatively the same direction, however, the y-coordinates suggests that obstacle 30265 is in an adjacent lane. It represents a medium risk as its trajectory should be monitored for potential lane changes or unexpected maneuvers by either vehicle.
