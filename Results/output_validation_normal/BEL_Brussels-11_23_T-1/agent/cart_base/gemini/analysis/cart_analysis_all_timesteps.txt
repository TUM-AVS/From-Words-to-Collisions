Here's the analysis and the resulting JSON:

**Analysis:**

The ego vehicle (ID 30261) starts in lanelet 767 and transitions to lanelet 1758.  We need to pay close attention to obstacles in or near these lanelets.  Let's examine the obstacles and their trajectories:

* **Obstacle 30257:**  This obstacle remains in lanelet 499 and its y-coordinate is significantly different from the ego vehicle, posing no immediate threat. Its risk level is negligible.

* **Obstacle 30258:** This obstacle starts in lanelet 770 and transitions to lanelet 1761. While its y-coordinate gets closer to the ego vehicle, the x-coordinate suggests they are moving in a parallel manner and not directly towards each other, thus the risk isn't high.

* **Obstacle 30260:** This obstacle is in lanelet 1759, very close to the ego vehicle's final lanelet (1758). It is also decelerating rapidly. This is a HIGH RISK obstacle.  By 0.9 seconds, its x position (20,91.0894) is close to the ego vehicle's (25.3502, -88.8568) and requires careful monitoring for potential lane changes or further deceleration.

* **Obstacle 30265:** This obstacle is in lanelet 768, adjacent to the ego vehicle's initial lanelet. It also has a similar orientation and velocity.  However, its y-coordinate is decreasing faster than the ego vehicle's, indicating it's moving away. While proximity makes it worth monitoring, it's not a high risk at the moment.
