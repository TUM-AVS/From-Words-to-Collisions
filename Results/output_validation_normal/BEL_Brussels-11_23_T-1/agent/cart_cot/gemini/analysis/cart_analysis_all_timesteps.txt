At t=0.9s, the ego vehicle is at (25.3502, -88.8568) with a velocity of 4.962 and acceleration of 0.1521.  Let's analyze the risk posed by each obstacle at this timestep, considering their trajectories from previous timesteps.

**Obstacle 30257:** Position (25.5815, -111.3807), Velocity 6.3129, Acceleration 0.3591. This obstacle is far behind the ego vehicle in the y-direction and poses no immediate threat.  Lateral separation is also substantial. Risk Score: 5 (Negligible Risk)

**Obstacle 30258:** Position (17.4638, -101.8585), Velocity 6.4274, Acceleration 0.5435. This obstacle is also significantly behind the ego vehicle and also to the left. The difference in y-coordinates suggests no immediate longitudinal risk. Lanelet changes for this obstacle in previous timesteps (770 to 1761) suggest a possible maneuvering behavior, but it currently does not present a direct collision course. Risk Score: 5 (Negligible Risk)

**Obstacle 30260:** Position (19.6821, -91.0894), Velocity 1.1437, Acceleration -6.37. While this obstacle is closer to the ego vehicle in the y-direction, it has a low velocity and a large negative acceleration. This suggests it is braking heavily or nearly stationary, reducing immediate risk. The x-coordinate difference also offers lateral separation.  Risk Score: 4 (Low Risk)

**Obstacle 30265:** Position (27.1981, -79.6894), Velocity 4.704, Acceleration -2.2018. This obstacle is ahead of the ego vehicle in the y-direction and to the right. The ego vehicle's position and orientation changes (lanelet 767 to 1758) suggest a possible lane change.  The obstacle is also decelerating. Though a collision isn't imminent in the next second, the proximity and relative velocities warrant attention. Further evaluation needed depending on lane change dynamics and future accelerations of both vehicles. Risk Score: 3 (Medium Risk).
