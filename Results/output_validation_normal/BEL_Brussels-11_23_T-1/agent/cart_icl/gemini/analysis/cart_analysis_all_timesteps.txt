At t=0.9s, the ego vehicle (ID 30261) is at (25.3502, -88.8568) with a velocity of 4.962 m/s and acceleration of 0.1521 m/s². Let's analyze each obstacle:

* **Obstacle 30257:** Located at (25.5815, -111.3807). This obstacle poses no immediate risk as it is far behind the ego vehicle in the y-coordinate (-88.8568 vs -111.3807), indicating significant longitudinal separation.  The x-coordinates (25.3502 vs 25.5815) suggest they might be in adjacent lanes, but the large y-distance mitigates the risk. Risk: **Negligible (5)**

* **Obstacle 30258:** Located at (17.4638, -101.8585). Similar to Obstacle 30257, this one is also significantly behind the ego vehicle in the y-coordinate. While the x-coordinate difference is more pronounced, the substantial longitudinal separation reduces the risk. Risk: **Negligible (5)**

* **Obstacle 30260:** Located at (19.6821, -91.0894). This obstacle is the closest to the ego vehicle in terms of the y-coordinate, and also shows a noticeable difference in the x-coordinate. It's important to note that this obstacle has been consistently decelerating at -6.37 m/s², which might lead to a risky situation in the near future if the ego vehicle maintains its current velocity and acceleration. Further analysis using TTC would be helpful with more future data.  For now, it's classified as medium risk due to the proximity and the deceleration trend of the obstacle. Risk: **Medium (3)**

* **Obstacle 30265:** Located at (27.1981, -79.6894).  This obstacle is ahead of the ego vehicle in the y-coordinate and shows a significant difference in the x-coordinate. The trajectories suggest no immediate risk, even though they are in relatively close longitudinal proximity. Risk: **Low (4)**
