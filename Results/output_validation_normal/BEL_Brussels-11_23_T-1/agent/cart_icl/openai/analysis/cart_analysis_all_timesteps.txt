### Analysis:

#### Ego Vehicle:
- Position: (25.3502, -88.8568), Orientation: -2.1539, Velocity: 4.962, Acceleration: 0.1521
- Current Lanelet: 1758.0

#### Obstacle Evaluation at 0.9 Seconds:

1. **Obstacle 30257:**
   - Position: (25.5815, -111.3807), Velocity: 6.3129
   - Relative longitudinal position: 22.524 (-111.3807 - (-88.8568)) m behind Ego
   - Relative velocity: 6.3129 - 4.962 = 1.3509 m/s (slightly faster than Ego)
   - TTC = Not applicable as obstacle is significantly behind
   - **Risk:** Negligible (5)

2. **Obstacle 30258:**
   - Position: (17.4638, -101.8585), Velocity: 6.4274
   - Lateral relative distance: 7.8864 (25.3502 - 17.4638) m
   - Lanelet difference suggests a separate path
   - **Risk:** Negligible (5)

3. **Obstacle 30260:**
   - Position: (19.6821, -91.0894), Velocity: 1.1437
   - Relative longitudinal position: 2.2326 m behind Ego
   - Relative velocity: 4.962 - 1.1437 = 3.8183 m/s (Ego moving faster)
   - TTC = Not feasible to calculate as the obstacle is slowing significantly
   - Trajectory indicates slowing/stopping significantly in own lanelet
   - **Risk:** Medium (3)

4. **Obstacle 30265:**
   - Position: (27.1981, -79.6894), Velocity: 4.704
   - Relative position in front: ~9.67m
   - Relatively in front, moving in same direction, but varying lanelets
   - **Risk:** Low (4)

### JSON Output:
```json
{
    "CollisionObstacles": [],
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {},
    "HighRiskObstacle": {}
}
```

In this scenario, none of the obstacles presented an immediate collision risk based on their trajectories and positions relative to the ego vehicle. Obstacles 30260 showed a reasonable slowdown indicating a medium risk while demonstrating no extreme or collision risks. Therefore, the JSON reflects this analysis with no extreme or high-risk listings.
