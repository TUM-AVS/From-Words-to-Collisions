At t=0.9s, Obstacle 30260 poses an extreme risk. It is only 0.48m ahead longitudinally and moving towards the ego vehicle at -3.82 m/s. While it is slightly to the right (-1.89m laterally), the high closing velocity and proximity suggest a possible collision is imminent unless immediate action is taken.

Obstacle 30265 is at a medium risk level. Although it is behind the ego vehicle longitudinally (-4.16m) and slightly to the right (-1.90m), it is moving laterally towards the ego vehicle.  The longitudinal motion is slightly away from the ego vehicle. Continuous monitoring is needed.

Other obstacles (30257 and 30258) are not a concern at this timestep.
