### Safety analysis for timestep 0.9s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 30257**
- Distance Risk reason: Located 14.17m longitudinally and 14.17m laterally in the front-left, posing no immediate threat.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason:  The obstacle is moving towards the ego vehicle longitudinally, but laterally moving away.  Given the distances and relative velocities, collision is unlikely.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 30258**
- Distance Risk reason: Located 10.69m longitudinally and 10.69m laterally in front, providing a safe distance.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Moving away from the ego vehicle both longitudinally and laterally.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 30260**
- Distance Risk reason:  Extremely close at 0.48m longitudinally and 0.48m laterally in the front-right. High risk of collision.
- Distance safety score: 1
- Time Risk reason:  The longitudinal relative velocity indicates the obstacle is rapidly approaching the ego vehicle, further increasing collision risk. Lateral movement suggests a potential side-swipe scenario.
- Time safety score: 1
- Overall Risk score: 1

- **Obstacle ID: 30265**
- Distance Risk reason: Located -4.16m longitudinally and -4.16m laterally (rear-right). While close, it's behind the ego vehicle.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Moving away longitudinally and slightly towards the ego vehicle laterally but slowly enough to not represent immediate danger.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4
