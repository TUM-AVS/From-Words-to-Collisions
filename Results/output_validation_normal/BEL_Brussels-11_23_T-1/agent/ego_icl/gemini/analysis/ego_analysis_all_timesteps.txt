* **Obstacle 30257 (Front-Left):**  This obstacle has been consistently moving away laterally from the ego vehicle while approaching longitudinally over the observed time steps. At the last timestep, the longitudinal distance is 14.17m and the lateral distance is 10.99m.  Given the lateral movement away from the ego vehicle, the primary risk is longitudinal.  The longitudinal relative velocity is -5.14 m/s. TTC = 14.17m / 5.14 m/s = 2.76s, MDC > 5m. This indicates a Medium Risk (3) due to the longitudinal approach, but the increasing lateral distance mitigates overall risk.

* **Obstacle 30258 (Front):** This obstacle is directly in front of the ego vehicle (lateral distance 0.00m) but is moving away longitudinally at the latest timestep. The longitudinal distance is increasing (10.69m), and the relative longitudinal velocity is 1.23 m/s meaning that the obstacle is moving away. Hence, there is no risk of collision. The risk level is Negligible (5).

* **Obstacle 30260 (Front-Right):** This obstacle is the most concerning. It is approaching the ego vehicle both longitudinally and laterally. The longitudinal distance is only 0.48m, and the lateral distance is -1.89m. The motion description confirms the closing distances. With a longitudinal relative velocity of -3.82 m/s, TTC = 0.48m / 3.82m/s â‰ˆ 0.13s.  The MDC is less than 0.5 meters and the calculated TTC is also very low. This obstacle poses an Extreme Risk (1) of collision.

* **Obstacle 30265 (Rear-Right):** At the last timestep, this obstacle is behind and to the right and slightly moving away longitudinally (-0.26m/s). The longitudinal distance is -4.16m and the lateral distance is -1.90m.  The overall distance is increasing, and though the lateral distance is small, it is not rapidly decreasing.  With the longitudinal distance increasing, and the lateral distance fairly stable, this presents a Low risk (4).
