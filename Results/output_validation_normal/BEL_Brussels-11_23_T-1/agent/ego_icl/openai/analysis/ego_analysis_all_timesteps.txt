### Obstacle 30257 Analysis:

- **Position and Motion (Most Recent Timestep):**
  - Location: Front-left
  - Adjusted Distance: Longitudinal 14.17 m, Lateral 10.99 m
  - Relative Velocity: Longitudinal -5.14 m/s, Lateral 6.31 m/s
  - The obstacle is moving toward the ego vehicle longitudinally but continues to move away laterally.

- **Trajectory Across Timesteps:**
  - Longitudinal distance is consistently decreasing.
  - The lateral distance is increasing steadily, showing the obstacle is moving away to the left.

- **TTC and MDC Calculations:**
  - Longitudinal TTC = \( \frac{14.17}{5.14} \approx 2.76 \) seconds (for longitudinal approach)
  - Lateral approach is not decreasing; hence TTC in lateral is not applicable.
  - Minimum Distance to Collision largely safe due to significantly increasing lateral distance.

- **Risk Assessment:**
  - Longitudinal trajectory shows medium risk due to decreasing distance.
  - Lateral safe space implies low risk.
  - **Overall Risk Score: Medium Risk (3)**

### Obstacle 30258 Analysis:

- **Position and Motion (Most Recent Timestep):**
  - Location: Front
  - Adjusted Distance: Longitudinal 10.69 m, Lateral 0.00 m
  - Relative Velocity: Longitudinal 1.23 m/s, Lateral 1.71 m/s
  - Motion indicates it's moving away longitudinally, and some movement laterally.

- **Trajectory Across Timesteps:**
  - Longitudinal distance slightly increasing.
  - Zero lateral alignment maintains same-lane trajectory.

- **TTC and MDC Calculations:**
  - Longitudinal TTC does not approach due to increasing distance.
  - Lateral distance is exactly aligned but non-critical given the scenario.

- **Risk Assessment:**
  - Trajectories indicate increasing distance.
  - **Overall Risk Score: Negligible Risk (5)**

### Obstacle 30260 Analysis:

- **Position and Motion (Most Recent Timestep):**
  - Location: Front-right
  - Adjusted Distance: Longitudinal 0.48 m, Lateral -1.89 m
  - Relative Velocity: Longitudinal -3.82 m/s
  - The obstacle is driving toward the ego vehicle with negative lateral placement meaning it's almost aligned with ego vehicle's right edge.

- **Trajectory Across Timesteps:**
  - Consistent reduction in longitudinal distance.
  - Lateral aligns very closely, indicating possible crossing path.

- **TTC and MDC Calculations:**
  - Longitudinal TTC = \( \frac{0.48}{3.82} \approx 0.13 \) seconds
  - Proximity indicates imminent collision due to decreasing distance and overlapping trajectories.

- **Risk Assessment:**
  - Very close to colliding based on projections.
  - **Overall Risk Score: Extreme Risk (1)**

### Obstacle 30265 Analysis:

- **Position and Motion (Most Recent Timestep):**
  - Location: Rear-right
  - Adjusted Distance: Longitudinal -4.16 m, Lateral -1.90 m
  - Relative Velocity: Longitudinal -0.26 m/s
  - The obstacle is slightly decelerating and thus moving away longitudinally.

- **Trajectory Across Timesteps:**
  - Minimal changes in trajectory reflect stability.
  - Lateral and longitudinal distances do not shrink significantly.

- **TTC and MDC Calculations:**
  - Longitudinal movement not imminent for collision.
  - Lateral movement is stable, no closing velocities.

- **Risk Assessment:**
  - Paths do not indicate any closing risk.
  - **Overall Risk Score: Negligible Risk (5)**

### JSON Summary:
