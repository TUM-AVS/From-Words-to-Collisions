At t=0.9s, Ego (30261.0) is at (25.3502, -88.8568) in lanelet 1758.0.  Obstacle 30260.0 is at (19.6821, -91.0894) in lanelet 1759.0. While the y-coordinates are relatively close, the x-coordinates suggest they are not likely to immediately collide, especially considering Ego's current velocity and acceleration. No obstacles pose an immediate collision risk.
