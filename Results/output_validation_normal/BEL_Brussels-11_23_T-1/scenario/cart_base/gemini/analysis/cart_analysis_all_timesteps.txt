At t=0.9s, Ego (30261.0) is at (25.3502, -88.8568) in lanelet 1758.0. Let's analyze the risk posed by each obstacle at this timestep:

* **Obstacle 30257.0:** Located at (25.5815, -111.3807) in lanelet 499.0.  While the x-coordinate is close to the ego vehicle, the y-coordinate shows a significant separation. Given the trajectory and current velocities, no immediate collision is likely. This obstacle poses a low risk.

* **Obstacle 30258.0:** Located at (17.4638, -101.8585) in lanelet 1761.0.  This obstacle is far from the ego vehicle and poses no immediate risk.

* **Obstacle 30260.0:** Located at (19.6821, -91.0894) in lanelet 1759.0.  While the y-coordinate is somewhat close to the ego vehicle, the x-coordinate indicates a safe lateral separation.  Furthermore, this obstacle's velocity is decreasing significantly over the past few timesteps, further reducing risk. This obstacle poses a low risk.

* **Obstacle 30265.0:** Located at (27.1981, -79.6894) in lanelet 768.0.  This obstacle is located behind the ego vehicle and moving slower. Therefore, there is no immediate risk of collision.
