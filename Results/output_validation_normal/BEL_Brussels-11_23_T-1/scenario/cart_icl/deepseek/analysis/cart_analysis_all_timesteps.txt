### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep (0.9 seconds):

### Obstacle Analysis:
1. **Obstacle ID: 30257.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Located far away (X: 25.5815, Y: -111.3807) and moving away from ego (X: 25.3502, Y: -88.8568). No intersection with ego's lanelet (1758.0 vs. 499.0).
   - **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: Relative velocity is low, and trajectory shows consistent movement away from ego.
   - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)

2. **Obstacle ID: 30258.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Located at (17.4638, -101.8585), moving away from ego and in lanelet 1761.0 (different from ego's 1758.0). No immediate intersection.
   - **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: Velocity (6.4274) is higher than ego's (4.962), but trajectory diverges.
   - **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low Risk)

3. **Obstacle ID: 30260.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Closest obstacle (X: 19.6821, Y: -91.0894) but still in lanelet 1759.0 (adjacent to ego's 1758.0). Distance is ~6.5 units.
   - **Distance safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: Decelerating rapidly (acceleration: -6.37), velocity (1.1437) is much lower than ego's (4.962).
   - **Time safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 3 (Medium Risk)

4. **Obstacle ID: 30265.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Located at (27.1981, -79.6894), moving in lanelet 768.0 (parallel to ego's path). Distance is ~9.2 units.
   - **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: Velocity (4.704) is slightly lower than ego's (4.962), but trajectories are parallel.
   - **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low Risk)

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. No obstacles are in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle at the most recent timestep.
2. Obstacle 30260.0 is the closest but is decelerating rapidly and not on a collision course.
3. All other obstacles are either moving away or on diverging paths.
4. No immediate collision risk detected.
