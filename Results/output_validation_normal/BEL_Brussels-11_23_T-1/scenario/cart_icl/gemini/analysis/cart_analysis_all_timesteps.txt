- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5


### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
No obstacles pose an immediate collision risk at the most recent timestep.  Obstacle 30260 was initially somewhat close, but its trajectory and deceleration suggest it is moving away and poses no immediate threat. This is not a collision scenario.
