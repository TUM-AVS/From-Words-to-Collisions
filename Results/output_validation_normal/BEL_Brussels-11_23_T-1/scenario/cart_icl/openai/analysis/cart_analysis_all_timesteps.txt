### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
The ego vehicle is in lanelet 1758, with no obstacles in immediate collision path. Obstacle 30260 presents some risk due to reduced speed, however, current trajectory analysis doesn't indicate an imminent collision. Most obstacles are either moving away or in different lanelets, ensuring low immediate collision risk.
