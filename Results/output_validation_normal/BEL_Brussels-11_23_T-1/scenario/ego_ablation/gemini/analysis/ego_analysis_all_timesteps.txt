Obstacle 30260 is at high risk of collision. It is very close to the ego longitudinally (0.48m) and closing at -3.82 m/s. Although it is moving to the right laterally, the small longitudinal distance and high closing speed suggest a possible collision.

Obstacle 30265 is also a concern. While it's slightly moving away longitudinally, it's very close to the ego laterally and slightly moving towards the ego from the right.

Although it is moving to the right laterally (-1.89), the small longitudinal distance and high closing speed make a collision likely. Additionally, Obstacle 30265, while slightly moving away longitudinally, is very close laterally and moving towards the ego slightly from the right, presenting an extreme risk."
