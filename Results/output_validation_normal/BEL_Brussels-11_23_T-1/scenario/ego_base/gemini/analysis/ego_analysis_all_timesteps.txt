Obstacle 30260 is at high risk of collision. It is located in the Front-right of the ego vehicle at a very close longitudinal distance of 0.48 m and a lateral distance of -1.89 m.  Its longitudinal relative velocity indicates it is moving towards the ego car at -3.82 m/s and the relative acceleration suggests the closing speed might increase (3.59 m/sÂ²).

Obstacle 30265, located at the Rear-right, poses a medium risk. Although its longitudinal distance is -4.16 m indicating it's behind the ego vehicle, it is moving towards the ego car laterally from the right.  While not immediately critical, its trajectory warrants attention to avoid potential side collisions.
