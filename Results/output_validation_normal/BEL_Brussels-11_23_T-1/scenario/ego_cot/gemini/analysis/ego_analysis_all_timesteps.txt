### Safety analysis for timestep 0.9 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

**Assumptions and Clarifications:**

*  Since adjusted distances (adjusted_d_long, adjusted_d_lat) are not provided in the scenario context, I will use the provided real distances (DTClong, DTClat) for calculations, but I will emphasize that using real distances without accounting for vehicle size may lead to inaccurate risk assessments.  An expert collision analysis system *must* account for vehicle dimensions. This analysis will highlight how that impacts safety scores if that data were present.
* TTC calculations require relative velocity. A negative relative velocity indicates the obstacle is moving towards the ego vehicle. If the relative velocity is positive (moving away), TTC is considered not applicable (N/A) and represents no immediate risk. I will assign a score of 5 for such cases.
*  I will make educated guesses about potential collision risk based on available data, but the lack of vehicle dimensions makes precise TTC calculations impossible. I will explain these assumptions explicitly.

### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 30257**
- Distance Risk reason: Located 14.17m longitudinally and 14.17m laterally in the front-left. This represents a safe distance currently, but the obstacle *is* driving towards the ego car longitudinally.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Although the obstacle is moving away laterally, the longitudinal relative velocity (-5.14 m/s) suggests movement towards the ego vehicle.  Without vehicle dimensions and a precise TTC calculation, it's hard to quantify the risk. It is likely manageable if there is enough lateral movement. 
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 30258**
- Distance Risk reason: Located 10.69m longitudinally and 10.69m laterally in front. This is a moderately safe distance, and the obstacle is moving away longitudinally.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Positive longitudinal velocity (1.23 m/s) indicates movement away from the ego vehicle.  Laterally, the positive velocity of 1.71m/s combined with the distance implies moving away.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 30260**
- Distance Risk reason: Located 0.48m longitudinally and 0.48m laterally in the front-right. This is EXTREMELY close, posing an immediate collision risk without prompt evasive action by the ego vehicle.
- Distance safety score: 1
- Time Risk reason: Negative longitudinal velocity (-3.82 m/s) indicates fast movement towards the ego vehicle. This, coupled with the proximity, implies a high likelihood of collision in the next timestep if there is no ego vehicle reaction. Lack of adjusted distances hinders accurate TTC calculation.  The lateral movement seems minimal.
- Time safety score: 1
- Overall Risk score: 1

- **Obstacle ID: 30265**
- Distance Risk reason: Located 4.16m behind and to the right of the ego vehicle.  Proximity and being behind, the rear-right position makes it a potential hazard.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: Although moving very slowly, the longitudinal relative velocity indicates the obstacle is moving away from the ego vehicle longitudinally (-0.26m/s).  The positive lateral velocity suggests lateral movement toward the ego vehicle (0.01m/s).
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4



### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
    "CollisionObstacle": null,
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "30260",
        "OverallRiskScore": "1"
    },
    "IsCollisionScenario": false,
    "Justification": "Obstacle 30260 poses an extreme risk due to its very close proximity (0.48m longitudinally and laterally) and significant negative relative longitudinal velocity. While not a certain collision in this timestep, immediate evasive action is required to avoid collision."
