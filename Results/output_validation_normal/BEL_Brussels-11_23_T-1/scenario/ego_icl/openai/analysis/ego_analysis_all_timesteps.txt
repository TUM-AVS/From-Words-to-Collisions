### Obstacle-by-Obstacle Analysis:

1. **Obstacle 30257:**
   - **Position/Trajectory:** Front-left, moving longitudinally toward the ego vehicle with decreasing distance and moving laterally away.
   - **Adjusted Distances:** Longitudinal 14.17 m, Lateral 10.99 m
   - **Relative Velocity:** Longitudinal -5.14 m/s, Lateral 6.31 m/s
   - **Motion Description:** Moving away laterally.
   - **TTC (Longitudinal):** 
     - \( \text{TTC} = \frac{14.17}{5.14} \approx 2.76 \) seconds
   - **MDC (Lateral):** Already moving away, so tracking projected lateral increase.
   - **Risk Assessment:** Medium Risk (3) due to longitudinal TTC within 3 seconds, but significant lateral clearance increasing.

2. **Obstacle 30258:**
   - **Position/Trajectory:** Directly in front, longitudinal alignment with increased distance
   - **Adjusted Distances:** Longitudinal 10.69 m, Lateral 0.00 m
   - **Relative Velocity:** Longitudinal 1.23 m/s, Lateral 1.71 m/s
   - **Motion Description:** Moving away longitudinally.
   - **TTC (Longitudinal):** 
     - Not applicable as the obstacle is moving away (\(1.23 \text{ m/s}\)).
   - **MDC:** Not relevant with increasing separation.
   - **Risk Assessment:** No Risk (5) due to moving away.

3. **Obstacle 30260:**
   - **Position/Trajectory:** Front-right, moving toward ego vehicle longitudinally and laterally.
   - **Adjusted Distances:** Longitudinal 0.48 m, Lateral 1.89 m
   - **Relative Velocity:** Longitudinal -3.82 m/s, Lateral 0.00 m/s
   - **Motion Description:** Driving toward the ego car longitudinally and laterally.
   - **TTC (Longitudinal):** 
     - \( \text{TTC} = \frac{0.48}{3.82} \approx 0.13 \) seconds (extremely short)
   - **MDC (Lateral):** 1.89 m, with decreasing clearance projected due to combined trajectories.
   - **Risk Assessment:** Extreme Risk (1) due to extremely low TTC and converging paths.

4. **Obstacle 30265:**
   - **Position/Trajectory:** Rear-right, moving slightly with increasing lateral motion toward the ego.
   - **Adjusted Distances:** Longitudinal -4.16 m, Lateral -1.90 m
   - **Relative Velocity:** Longitudinal -0.26 m/s, Lateral 0.01 m/s
   - **Motion Description:** Moving away longitudinally.
   - **TTC (Longitudinal):** Not applicable as it's almost stationary/moving apart.
   - **MDC:** Not critical due to stationary behavior.
   - **Risk Assessment:** No Risk (5) due to nearly stationary movement.

### Conclusion:
In this scenario, **Obstacle 30260** presents an **Extreme Risk (1)** due to its very short time-to-collision considering its high closing velocity and minimal initial distance to the ego vehicle, particularly in longitudinal direction. As such, this is identified as a **collision scenario**.
