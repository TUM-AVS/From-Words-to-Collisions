Both Ego and Obstacle 30082.0 are in the same lanelet (299.0) and heading in roughly the same direction (similar orientations).  The obstacle is ahead of the ego vehicle and traveling faster. However, both vehicles are decelerating.

Looking at the position data, the x-coordinates suggest the obstacle is pulling away from the ego vehicle. The difference in their y-coordinates is decreasing slightly over time, but the obstacle's x-position moves away faster than its y-position approaches the ego's. This makes a collision unlikely in the near future.  While the gap is closing slightly in the y-direction, there's no indication of an imminent collision.  It appears the ego vehicle is behind and to the right of the obstacle, and this lateral separation is maintained even with the obstacle's faster speed.

Therefore, within the given timeframe and assuming constant deceleration trends, a collision appears unlikely. At most, there's a low to medium risk, depending on future trajectory changes not depicted in this short snippet of the scenario.
