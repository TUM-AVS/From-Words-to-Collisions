Both the ego vehicle and obstacle 30082.0 are in the same lanelet (299.0) and heading in roughly the same direction (similar orientations).  The obstacle is initially ahead of the ego vehicle and moving faster. However, the obstacle's velocity is decreasing more rapidly than the ego vehicle's velocity.

Calculating the distance between the ego and the obstacle at each timestep:

* 0.1s: sqrt((-247.9824 + 259.0079)^2 + (-48.927 + 37.6734)^2) ≈ 16.15m
* 0.2s: sqrt((-249.5277 + 260.9593)^2 + (-47.3495 + 35.6817)^2) ≈ 16.68m
* 0.3s: sqrt((-251.043 + 262.8725)^2 + (-45.8027 + 33.7288)^2) ≈ 17.06m
* 0.4s: sqrt((-252.5271 + 264.7456)^2 + (-44.2876 + 31.817)^2) ≈ 17.32m
* 0.5s: sqrt((-253.9835 + 266.5776)^2 + (-42.8009 + 29.9471)^2) ≈ 17.48m
* 0.6s: sqrt((-255.4069 + 268.3691)^2 + (-41.3477 + 28.1185)^2) ≈ 17.56m
* 0.7s: sqrt((-256.8025 + 270.1196)^2 + (-39.9229 + 26.3318)^2) ≈ 17.58m
* 0.8s: sqrt((-258.1739 + 271.829)^2 + (-38.523 + 24.5869)^2) ≈ 17.55m
* 0.9s: sqrt((-259.5162 + 273.4974)^2 + (-37.1526 + 22.884)^2) ≈ 17.49m

The distance between the vehicles is increasing, indicating no immediate risk of collision. Although they are in the same lane, the obstacle remains ahead and the separation distance grows over the given time period.  Therefore, the risk level can be classified as Low (4) or Negligible (5), but certainly not Collision (0), Extreme Risk (1), or even High Risk (2).
