Here's the collision risk analysis for the provided scenario:

**Analysis at t=0.9s:**

1. **Ego Vehicle State:**
    - Position: (-259.5162, -37.1526)
    - Velocity: 18.6642 (units assumed to be m/s)
    - Acceleration: -1.7786 (units assumed to be m/s^2)

2. **Obstacle (ID: 30082.0) State:**
    - Position: (-273.4974, -22.884)
    - Velocity: 23.6933 (units assumed to be m/s)
    - Acceleration: -5.8656 (units assumed to be m/s^2)

3. **Relative Position and Velocity:**
    - Δx (longitudinal): -273.4974 - (-259.5162) = -13.9812 m
    - Δy (lateral): -22.884 - (-37.1526) = 14.2686 m
    - Δvx (longitudinal velocity difference): 23.6933 - 18.6642 = 5.0291 m/s
    - Δvy (lateral velocity difference): We need more information on the individual velocity components to determine this accurately. Assuming the vehicles are primarily moving longitudinally and the orientations are almost identical, we approximate Δvy as near 0.

4. **Time to Collision (TTC) Approximation:**
    - Longitudinal TTC:  Δx / Δvx = -13.9812 m / 5.0291 m/s ≈ -2.78 seconds.  The negative sign implies the obstacle is behind the ego vehicle in the chosen coordinate system.

5. **Minimum Distance Calculation (MDC):**
    -  MDC at t=0.9s: sqrt(Δx^2 + Δy^2) = sqrt((-13.9812)^2 + (14.2686)^2) ≈ 19.98 m

6. **Risk Assessment:**
    - Though MDC is currently significant, the obstacle is approaching faster than the ego vehicle in the longitudinal direction since it's closing the distance. This means that there is still risk and will need quick action.  However, because the vehicles are not presently extremely close, a collision does not appear imminent within the next second, though it is possible if these trajectories remain unchanged and the lateral distance becomes negligible.

**Prediction and Overall Risk Score:**

Based on the provided data, it's difficult to accurately predict a collision with absolute certainty. The current trajectories show convergence, particularly longitudinally.  More data points are needed to refine the TTC and account for potential changes in acceleration and lateral movement.  However, given the shrinking distance and speed differential, we can assign risk scores. We'll assume that our coordinate system and the given velocity indicate the vehicles are traveling in roughly the same global direction.


- Obstacle 30082.0: Considering the decreasing distance and the rate of closure, this obstacle presents a **High Risk (Score 2)** of collision if the current trajectories are maintained, which will need quick action to avoid collision.
