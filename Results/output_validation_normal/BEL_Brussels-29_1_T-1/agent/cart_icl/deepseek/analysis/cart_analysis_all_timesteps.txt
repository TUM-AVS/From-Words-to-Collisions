### Analysis:

1. **Relative Motion and Trajectory**:
   - The ego vehicle and obstacle (ID: 30082) are both moving in the same lanelet (299.0) with similar orientations (~2.3459 radians).
   - The obstacle is ahead of the ego vehicle and moving at a higher velocity (23.6933 m/s vs. 18.6642 m/s at 0.9s).
   - The distance between the ego and the obstacle is decreasing over time, but the obstacle is decelerating faster than the ego (-5.8656 m/s² vs. -1.7786 m/s² at 0.9s).

2. **Time to Collision (TTC)**:
   - At 0.9s, the relative longitudinal distance is ~14.0 m (calculated as the Euclidean distance between (-259.5162, -37.1526) and (-273.4974, -22.884)).
   - The relative longitudinal velocity is ~5.0291 m/s (23.6933 m/s - 18.6642 m/s).
   - TTC = 14.0 / 5.0291 ≈ 2.78s. This suggests a medium-term risk, but not immediate.

3. **Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC)**:
   - The lateral distance is negligible since both vehicles are in the same lanelet and have nearly identical orientations.
   - The primary risk is longitudinal, with the obstacle decelerating faster than the ego, which reduces the risk of collision.

4. **Risk Assessment**:
   - The TTC (~2.78s) and the decreasing relative velocity (due to the obstacle's higher deceleration) suggest a **Medium Risk (3)**. The ego has sufficient time to react, and the obstacle is slowing down faster than the ego.
