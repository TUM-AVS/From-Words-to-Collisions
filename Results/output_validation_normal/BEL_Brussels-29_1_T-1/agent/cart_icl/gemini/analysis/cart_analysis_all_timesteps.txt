At t=0.9s, the ego vehicle at (-259.5162, -37.1526) is in the same lanelet (299) as obstacle 30082 at (-273.4974, -22.884).  The obstacle is ahead of the ego vehicle and slightly to its left.

The obstacle's x-coordinate is decreasing at a faster rate than the ego's, indicating the obstacle is moving faster along the lane. The difference in y-coordinates indicates a lateral offset, meaning they are not perfectly aligned within the lane.

While more data points would be needed for precise TTC and MDC calculations, the consistent trend of decreasing distance between the vehicles suggests a potential risk.  The slightly different orientations (though nearly identical) and the lateral offset imply a potential lane change maneuver by one of the vehicles might be occurring or could be necessary to avoid conflict.  The information provided does not definitively indicate a certain collision, but the continued proximity and velocity difference warrant a higher risk assessment. Based on the given data, the risk level appears to be High (2).
