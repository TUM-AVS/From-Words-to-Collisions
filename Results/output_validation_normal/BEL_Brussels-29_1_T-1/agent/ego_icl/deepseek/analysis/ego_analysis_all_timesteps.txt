### Obstacle-by-Obstacle Analysis

#### Obstacle 30082
- **Direction**: Front of the ego car
- **Adjusted Distances**: 
  - Longitudinal: 15.47 m (increasing over time)
  - Lateral: 0.00 m (exact alignment, but stable)
- **Relative Velocity**: 
  - Longitudinal: 5.03 m/s (positive, but obstacle is moving away)
  - Lateral: 0.00 m/s (no lateral movement)
- **Motion Description**: Obstacle is moving away longitudinally. Exact lateral alignment or unknown case.
- **Trajectory Analysis**: 
  - Longitudinal distance is increasing (from 11.25 m at 0.1s to 15.47 m at 0.9s).
  - Lateral distance remains exactly 0.00 m, but no lateral movement or closing velocity.
  - The obstacle is moving away from the ego vehicle, so no collision risk.

#### TTC and MDC Calculations
- **TTC Longitudinal**: 
  - Distance: 15.47 m
  - Relative Velocity: 5.03 m/s (moving away, so TTC is not applicable for collision risk)
  - TTC: N/A (diverging paths)
- **TTC Lateral**: 
  - Distance: 0.00 m
  - Relative Velocity: 0.00 m/s
  - TTC: N/A (no movement)
- **MDC**: 
  - Longitudinal: 15.47 m (Low Risk, MDC > 5.0 m)
  - Lateral: 0.00 m (but no closing velocity, so no collision risk)
  - Overall MDC: 15.47 m (Low Risk)

#### Risk Assessment
- **Longitudinal Risk**: Low Risk (MDC > 5.0 m, TTC N/A)
- **Lateral Risk**: Negligible Risk (no closing velocity, exact alignment but no collision risk)
- **Overall Risk**: Low Risk (4)

### Explanation
- There is no collision or extreme/high risk obstacle in this scenario.
- Obstacle 30082 is moving away from the ego vehicle longitudinally, and there is no lateral movement or closing velocity.
- The longitudinal distance is increasing, and the lateral distance is stable at 0.00 m but poses no risk due to no closing velocity.
- The overall risk is Low (4) for Obstacle 30082, but since the thresholds for collision, extreme, or high risk are not met, the JSON summary reflects no such obstacles.
