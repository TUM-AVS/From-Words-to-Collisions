Obstacle 30082 is in front of the ego vehicle and moving away longitudinally.  Across the provided timesteps, the longitudinal distance has consistently increased from 11.25m to 15.47m, while the lateral distance remains at 0.00m.  This indicates the obstacle is directly ahead of the ego vehicle and moving further away. Since the relative longitudinal velocity is positive and increasing, TTC is not applicable in a closing velocity scenario.

Given the increasing longitudinal distance and the obstacle moving away, there is no risk of collision. MDC is 15.47m (longitudinal distance at the last timestep).
