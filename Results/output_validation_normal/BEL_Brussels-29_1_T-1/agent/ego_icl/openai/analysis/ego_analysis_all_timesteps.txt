### Obstacle Analysis

**Obstacle ID:** 30082

**Position Relative to Ego Vehicle:** Front

#### Trajectory Analysis:
- **Time Step Analysis:** The obstacle's position is consistently in front of the ego vehicle. 
- **Longitudinal Distance Over Time:**
  - 0.1s: 11.25m
  - 0.2s: 11.83m
  - 0.3s: 12.40m
  - 0.4s: 12.95m
  - 0.5s: 13.49m
  - 0.6s: 14.01m
  - 0.7s: 14.52m
  - 0.8s: 15.00m
  - 0.9s: 15.47m
- **Lateral Distance:** Constantly 0.00m, aligning it laterally with the ego vehicle but moving away longitudinally.

#### Most Recent Timestep (0.9 seconds):

- **Adjusted Longitudinal Distance:** Assuming negligible adjustments, using 15.47m as given.
- **Adjusted Lateral Distance:** 0.00m, indicating longitudinal alignment.

#### Motion Description:
- Motion: The obstacle is moving away longitudinally.

#### Risk Metric Calculations:
- **TTC Calculation:**
  - Relative Longitudinal Velocity: 5.03 m/s (positive, moving away)
  - Since the obstacle moves away, TTC isn't directly applicable for collision but indicates diverging paths.
  
- **MDC Calculation:**
  - MDC based on trajectories and descriptions indicates a diverging path, since longitudinal distance is increasing and the relative velocity is positive.
  
#### Risk Assessment:
- **TTC:** As the paths are diverging, the TTC is not a concern for collision, indicating minimal risk.
- **MDC:** Given the increasing longitudinal distance and positive relative velocity, the MDC is greater than 5.0 meters.

#### Overall Risk Assessment:
- Based on the increasing distance and positive relative velocity, the risk level is negligible and the obstacle poses no significant collision risk.
