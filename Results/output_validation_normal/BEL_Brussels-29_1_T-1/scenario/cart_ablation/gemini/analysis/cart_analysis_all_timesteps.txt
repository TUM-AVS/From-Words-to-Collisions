At t=0.9s, the ego vehicle is at (-259.5162, -37.1526) and the obstacle (ID 30082.0) is at (-273.4974, -22.884).  Both are in the same lanelet (299.0) and have similar orientations. The obstacle is ahead of the ego vehicle and slightly to its left.

While the obstacle's velocity is higher than the ego's, both are decelerating.  Examining the trajectories from previous timesteps indicates the obstacle's x-position is consistently ahead of the ego vehicle, and the difference in y-position is shrinking, suggesting a possible future collision if these trends continue.  However, at this specific timestep, they are not extremely close, nor are their velocities/accelerations such that a collision is imminent within the next timestep or two. Therefore, I classify this as a medium risk (3), not a collision or extreme risk.

```json
{
    "CollisionObstacles": [],
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null,
    "ScenarioAnalysis": {
        "IsCollisionScenario": false,
        "Reasoning": "No immediate collision is detected in the most recent timestep. Although the obstacle is in the same lane and ahead of the ego vehicle with a closing y-distance, the current separation and deceleration rates don't indicate an extreme or collision risk within the next immediate timestep."
    }
}
