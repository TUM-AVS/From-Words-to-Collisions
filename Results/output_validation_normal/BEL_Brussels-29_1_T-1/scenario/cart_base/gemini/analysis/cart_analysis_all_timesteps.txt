At t=0.9s, the ego vehicle is at (-259.5162, -37.1526) and the obstacle is at (-273.4974, -22.884). Both are in the same lanelet (299.0).  The obstacle is ahead of the ego vehicle and slightly to its left.  While the obstacle's velocity is higher than the ego's, both vehicles are decelerating.  Looking at the trajectory, the lateral distance difference isn't decreasing rapidly, and the longitudinal gap, while closing, doesn't suggest an immediate collision in the next instant.  Therefore, although a medium-term collision risk might exist, the immediate risk is low.
