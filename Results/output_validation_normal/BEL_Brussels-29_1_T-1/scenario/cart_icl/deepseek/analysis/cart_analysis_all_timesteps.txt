### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep:

### Obstacle Analysis:
- **Obstacle ID**: 30082.0  
  - **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is in the same lanelet (299.0) as the ego vehicle. Over the past timesteps, the distance between the ego and the obstacle has been decreasing, but the obstacle is still ahead and moving away (relative distance ~14m at 0.9s).  
  - **Distance safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk)  
  - **Time Risk reason**: The obstacle is decelerating faster than the ego vehicle (obstacle: -5.8656 m/s², ego: -1.7786 m/s²), but its velocity is still higher (obstacle: 23.6933 m/s, ego: 18.6642 m/s). The relative velocity is ~5 m/s, and the TTC is ~14m / 5m/s = ~2.8s.  
  - **Time safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk)  
  - **Overall Risk score**: 3 (Medium Risk)  

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. **Lanelet Check**: Both ego and obstacle are in lanelet 299.0, indicating shared space.  
2. **Trajectory Trend**: The obstacle is ahead and moving away, but the relative distance is closing slowly.  
3. **Velocity/Acceleration**: The obstacle is decelerating faster, reducing collision risk over time.  
4. **TTC/MDC**: TTC (~2.8s) and MDC (~14m) suggest manageable risk with current dynamics.
