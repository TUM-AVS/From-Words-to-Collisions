### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 30081.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 30081.0 is in a different lanelet (717.0) than the ego vehicle (299.0), and their x and y positions suggest a significant lateral separation.  History shows no indication of converging trajectories.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason:  The obstacle's velocity and acceleration history indicates it poses no immediate threat.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 30082.0
- Distance Risk reason: While in the same lanelet (299.0), Obstacle 30082.0 is ahead of the ego vehicle.  Examining the position history reveals increasing separation over time.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Obstacle 30082.0 has a higher velocity than the ego vehicle initially, but its negative acceleration suggests it is slowing down, further reducing risk.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4


### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. **Identify potential threats:** At the most recent timestep (0.9s), two obstacles (30081.0 and 30082.0) are present.
2. **Analyze Obstacle 30081.0:**  Located in a different lanelet and consistently far from the ego vehicle throughout the observed timeframe. It presents no risk.
3. **Analyze Obstacle 30082.0:** In the same lanelet as the ego vehicle but ahead. The historical data shows increasing separation and the obstacle is decelerating. No immediate collision risk.
4. **Collision Assessment:**  Neither obstacle poses a collision risk within the observed period.

### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
  "CollisionObstacles": [],
  "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null,
  "ScenarioAnalysis": {
    "IsCollisionScenario": false,
    "Reasoning": "No obstacle presents a collision risk in the observed timeframe. Obstacle 30081.0 is in a different lane and far away. Obstacle 30082.0 is in the same lane but ahead, with the distance between them increasing over time."
