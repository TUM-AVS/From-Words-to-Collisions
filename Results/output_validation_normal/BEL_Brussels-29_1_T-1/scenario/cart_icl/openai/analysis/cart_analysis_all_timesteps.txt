### Obstacle Analysis:

#### Obstacle: 30081.0
- **Distance Risk Reason**: Obstacle 30081.0 is located far from the ego vehicle, in a separate lanelet. The relative positions indicate that it remains at a consistent distance without converging paths.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 5
- **Time Risk Reason**: With a velocity of roughly 5.7 and minimal changes in acceleration, this obstacle is maintaining a steady speed and direction, which does not intersect with the ego vehicle's path.
- **Time Safety Score**: 5
- **Overall Risk Score**: 5

#### Obstacle: 30082.0
- **Distance Risk Reason**: Positioned in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle with a decreasing distance over each timestep, indicating convergence towards the ego vehicle.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 2 (High risk due to decreasing gap)
- **Time Risk Reason**: The obstacle's velocity is higher than that of the ego vehicle, indicating that it is closing in. Continuous deceleration reduces this risk.
- **Time Safety Score**: 3 (Moderate risk as it is slowing down)
- **Overall Risk Score**: 3

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
- **Identifying Location and Trajectory**: The key obstacle (30082.0) is in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle. Its position suggests it is converging with the ego vehicle's path.
- **Relative Motion and Speed**: While initially the obstacle was an extreme risk, its deceleration and the behavior over the timesteps suggest timely interventions could manage the risk.
- **Collision Scenario Determination**: Calculating potential collision by estimating how quickly both entities approach or diverge, 30082.0 displayed moderate risk due to deceleration efforts. However, no immediate collision is expected within the next second as the trend is slowing.
