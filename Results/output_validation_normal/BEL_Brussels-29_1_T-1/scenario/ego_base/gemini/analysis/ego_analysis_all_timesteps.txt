At t=0.9s, obstacle 30082 is moving away from the ego vehicle with a longitudinal velocity of 5.03 m/s.  The longitudinal distance is increasing (15.47 m) and the lateral distance is 0.  Although the relative acceleration fluctuates in previous timesteps, the obstacle consistently moves away longitudinally.  Thus, the risk is negligible.
