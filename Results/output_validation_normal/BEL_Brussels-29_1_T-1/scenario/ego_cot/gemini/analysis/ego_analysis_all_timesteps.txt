### Safety analysis for timestep 0.9 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 30082
- Distance Risk reason:  Obstacle 30082 is located in front of the ego vehicle at a lateral distance of 15.47m and a longitudinal distance of 15.47m.  Given it's moving away longitudinally and the considerable distance, there is no immediate distance-based risk.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: The obstacle is moving away from the ego vehicle longitudinally.  Given the current velocity and acceleration, there is no foreseeable risk of collision. TTC calculations are unnecessary as the distance is increasing.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5
