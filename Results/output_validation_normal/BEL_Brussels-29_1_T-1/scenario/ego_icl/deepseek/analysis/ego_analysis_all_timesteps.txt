### Obstacle-by-Obstacle Analysis (Most Recent Timestep: 0.9s)

**Obstacle 30082:**
- **Position:** Front of ego car
- **Adjusted Distances:** Longitudinal 15.47 m, Lateral 0.00 m
- **Relative Velocity:** Longitudinal 5.03 m/s (moving away), Lateral 0.00 m/s
- **Relative Acceleration:** Longitudinal 2.86 m/s², Lateral -2.92 m/s²
- **Motion Description:** Obstacle is moving away longitudinally. Exact lateral alignment.

#### Trajectory Analysis (0.1s to 0.9s):
- The longitudinal distance increases consistently from 11.25 m to 15.47 m over 0.9 seconds.
- The relative velocity is positive but decreasing slightly (from 6.07 m/s to 5.03 m/s), indicating the obstacle is moving away but the rate of separation is slowing.
- Lateral distance remains exactly 0.00 m throughout, but the motion description confirms the obstacle is not moving laterally toward the ego vehicle.

#### Time-to-Collision (TTC):
- **Longitudinal TTC:** Not applicable (relative velocity is positive, meaning the obstacle is moving away).
- **Lateral TTC:** Not applicable (relative velocity is 0.00 m/s).

#### Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC):
- **Longitudinal MDC:** 15.47 m (no risk, as the obstacle is moving away).
- **Lateral MDC:** 0.00 m (exact alignment), but the motion description indicates no lateral movement toward the ego.

#### Risk Assessment:
- **Longitudinal Risk:** No Risk (5) - The obstacle is moving away.
- **Lateral Risk:** No Risk (5) - Exact alignment but no converging trajectories.
- **Overall Risk:** No Risk (5) - No indication of collision or imminent danger.

### Conclusion:
- There is no collision or extreme risk in this scenario. The obstacle is moving away from the ego vehicle longitudinally and is laterally aligned but not converging.
