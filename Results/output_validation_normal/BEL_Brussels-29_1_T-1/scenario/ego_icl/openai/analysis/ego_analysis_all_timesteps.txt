### Obstacle Analysis

#### Obstacle 30082

- **Trajectory Analysis Across Timesteps:**
  - At each of the time steps from 0.1 seconds to 0.9 seconds, the obstacle has been consistently moving away from the ego vehicle. The longitudinal distance is increasing steadily, which indicates a trend where the obstacle is not approaching the ego vehicle.
  - The longitudinal relative velocity is positive and shows a decrease over time. This means the obstacle is accelerating in such a way that its speed relative to the ego is decreasing, further suggesting it is moving away.

- **Time-to-Collision (TTC) Calculation:**
  - At the most recent timestamp (0.9 seconds), the adjusted longitudinal distance between the obstacle and the ego vehicle appears to be increasing. The relative longitudinal velocity is 5.03 m/s (away from the ego), which indicates no collision course longitudinally.
  - Thus, TTC in the longitudinal direction is effectively not applicable as the obstacle is diverging from the ego vehicle.

- **Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC) Calculation:**
  - Since the obstacle is in the same longitudinal line with 0.00 m lateral distance from the ego (exact alignment), and given that it's moving away, the MDC effectively considers longitudinal distance changes.
  - With the longitudinal distance increasing over each timestep, the minimal distance remains far, indicating no imminent collision.

- **Risk Assessment:**
  - **TTC:** Since the obstacle is moving away (positive relative velocity), the TTC calculation is non-applicable in terms of predicting a collision in the current path.
  - **MDC:** Given the substantial longitudinal distance and trajectory, MDC reflects a situation where a collision is not imminent.
  - The risk score, based on TTC and MDC, is 5 (No Risk).

### Conclusion:

In this scenario, the systematic increase in distance and the trajectory of the obstacle indicate it is safely moving away from the ego vehicle. As a result, there is no risk of collision in the immediate future based on the available data for this obstacle.
