The ego vehicle and obstacle 30220 are in different lanelets (55 and 1272, respectively).  While the provided data doesn't give lanelet geometry, the positions suggest they are not intersecting. The distance between the ego and the obstacle decreases over the provided timesteps. However, the minimum distance, slightly less than 60 meters, along with their respective velocities and decelerations doesn't suggest an immediate or unavoidable collision within the observed timeframe. Therefore, no collision or extreme risk is identified. A more detailed analysis with lanelet geometry would be required to accurately assess the risk beyond the observed time window.
