### Analysis:

1. **Ego Vehicle (ID: 30221.0)**:
   - Position: (116.0397, 70.8413) at 0.9s
   - Orientation: -1.9977 radians (~ -114.5 degrees)
   - Velocity: 4.3827 m/s (decelerating)
   - Acceleration: -1.1001 m/s²

2. **Obstacle (ID: 30220.0)**:
   - Position: (110.576, 52.9969) at 0.9s
   - Orientation: -1.8222 radians (~ -104.4 degrees)
   - Velocity: 4.4963 m/s (decelerating)
   - Acceleration: -2.6752 m/s²

### Relative Motion:
- **Relative Position**: Ego is at (116.0397, 70.8413), Obstacle is at (110.576, 52.9969).
  - Longitudinal distance: ~17.84m (Ego ahead)
  - Lateral distance: ~5.46m (Ego to the right)
- **Relative Velocity**: Ego is moving at 4.3827 m/s, Obstacle at 4.4963 m/s.
  - Closing speed: ~0.1136 m/s (very slow)
- **TTC**: Not applicable (obstacle is behind and not closing fast).
- **MDC**: ~18.65m (Euclidean distance).

### Risk Assessment:
- The obstacle is behind the ego vehicle and not closing in rapidly. The lateral distance is significant (~5.46m), and the relative velocity is negligible (~0.1136 m/s). There is no immediate risk of collision.
