At t=0.9s, the ego vehicle is at (116.04, 70.84) with a velocity of 4.38 m/s and the obstacle (ID 30220) is at (110.58, 52.99) with a velocity of 4.50 m/s.  The lateral distance is substantial, approximately 17.85m. While the longitudinal distance is closing (around 5.46m), given the lateral separation and differing lane assignments (55 for ego and 1272 for the obstacle), the risk of collision appears low.  A more precise TTC calculation would require more information about the lanelet geometry and intended trajectories. However, based on the provided data, the vehicles seem to be moving on diverging paths.
