### Analysis

Upon evaluating the provided scenario, the focus is primarily on the most recent timestep (0.9 seconds) although trends from earlier times are considered for clearer insights into trajectories and velocity profiles.

#### Scenario Overview:
- **Ego Vehicle (ID: 30221.0)**
  - Position: (116.0397, 70.8413)
  - Velocity: 4.3827 m/s, Acceleration: -1.1001 m/s²
  - Positioned in lanelet 55.0

- **Obstacle (ID: 30220.0)**
  - Position: (110.576, 52.9969)
  - Velocity: 4.4963 m/s, Acceleration: -2.6752 m/s²
  - Positioned in lanelet 1272.0

#### Risk Assessment:
1. **Distance and Movement Analysis:**
   - The ego vehicle is heading in a significantly different direction with a decreasing speed.
   - The obstacle, being located in a different lanelet (1272.0 as opposed to ego's 55.0), implies a parallel movement in a different lane.

2. **Time to Collision (TTC) and Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC):**
   - The obstacle is not directly in the path of the ego vehicle as positions differ significantly in lanelet and Cartesian plane (i.e., around 16m lateral, increasing distance).
   - At the current relative speeds and trajectories, no immediate path crossing results in a collision.

3. **Relative Velocity and Position:**
   - The relative lateral position is about 16m, while the longitudinal position shows the obstacle is more than 5m behind in Y coordinates but in a different lanelet which evidences it moves laterally away.

Given this analysis, there is negligible immediate risk of collision due to different lane occupation and relative directions.

### JSON Output:

```json
{
    "CollisionObstacles": [],
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {},
    "HighRiskObstacle": {}
}
```

In this case, neither a collision nor extreme risk arises, and the closest situations are determined to be of negligible risk due to lanes and position differences. Hence there are no entries in the categories.
