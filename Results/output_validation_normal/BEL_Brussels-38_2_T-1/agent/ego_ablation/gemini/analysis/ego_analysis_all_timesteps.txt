At t=0.9s, obstacle 30220 is located front-left of the ego vehicle at a longitudinal distance of 14.00m and a lateral distance of 0.81m.  The relative longitudinal velocity is 0.04 m/s (moving slightly away from the ego car), and the lateral velocity is 0.79 m/s (moving away to the left). While the lateral distance is relatively small, the obstacle is moving away from the ego vehicle both longitudinally and laterally. The decreasing lateral distances over the 0.1s to 0.9s time frame might initially seem concerning, but the most recent data clearly indicates the obstacle is moving away laterally. Given the current distances, velocities, and the direction of motion, a collision is not imminent.  Therefore, I would rate this as a low risk (4) or negligible risk (5).
