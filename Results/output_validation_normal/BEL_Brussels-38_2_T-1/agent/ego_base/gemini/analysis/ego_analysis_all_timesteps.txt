At t=0.9s, Obstacle 30220 is located 14.00m longitudinally and 0.81m laterally in the front-left zone, moving away from the ego vehicle longitudinally at 0.04 m/s and laterally to the left at 0.79 m/s.  The lateral distance is decreasing but is not immediately dangerous. The longitudinal movement suggests the obstacle is no longer posing a direct threat.  The situation warrants monitoring but does not present an immediate high risk. I would classify this as a Medium Risk (3) due to the close proximity and lateral movement, allowing time for reaction and adjustment.
