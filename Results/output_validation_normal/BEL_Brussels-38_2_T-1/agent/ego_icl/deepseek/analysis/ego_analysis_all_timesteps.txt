### Obstacle Analysis: 30220

#### Trajectory Analysis (0.1s to 0.9s):
- **Longitudinal Distance**: Starts at 14.56m and decreases slightly to 14.00m, indicating the obstacle was initially approaching but then stabilized/moved away (relative velocity changes from -1.97 m/s to 0.04 m/s).
- **Lateral Distance**: Starts at 1.26m and decreases to 0.81m, but the obstacle is consistently moving away laterally (relative velocity remains positive, increasing from 1.30 m/s to 0.79 m/s).

#### Most Recent Timestep (0.9s):
- **Adjusted Distances**: Longitudinal = 14.00m, Lateral = 0.81m
- **Relative Velocities**: Longitudinal = 0.04 m/s (moving away), Lateral = 0.79 m/s (moving away)
- **Motion Description**: "Obstacle is moving away longitudinally. Obstacle is moving away laterally to the left."

#### Risk Assessment:
1. **Time-to-Collision (TTC)**:
   - Longitudinal: TTC = 14.00m / 0.04 m/s → 350s (diverging, no risk)
   - Lateral: TTC = 0.81m / 0.79 m/s → 1.03s (but moving away, so no risk)
   - **TTC Risk**: 5 (No Risk)

2. **Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC)**:
   - The obstacle is moving away in both dimensions, so MDC is the current distance (longitudinal 14.00m, lateral 0.81m).
   - The smaller distance is lateral (0.81m), but since the obstacle is moving away, the risk is minimal.
   - **MDC Risk**: 5 (No Risk)

3. **Overall Risk**:
   - The obstacle is moving away in both dimensions, and the distances are large enough to avoid any immediate risk.
   - **Overall Risk Score**: 5 (No Risk)
