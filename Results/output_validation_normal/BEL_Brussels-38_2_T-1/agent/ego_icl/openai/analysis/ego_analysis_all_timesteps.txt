### Obstacle Analysis:

#### Obstacle 30220 Analysis:
**Position and Trajectory:**
- At the most recent timestep (0.9 seconds), Obstacle 30220 is located in the front-left of the ego vehicle.
- Adjusted real distances are longitudinal 14.00 m and lateral 0.81 m.
- The obstacle is moving away in both longitudinal and lateral directions at this time.

**Trajectory over Time:**
- Between 0.0s and 0.9s, the obstacle was initially approaching the ego vehicle longitudinally with a slowing rate of approach (decreasing relative longitudinal velocity and decreasing lateral velocity moving away to the left).
- By 0.6s, the obstacle started to move away longitudinally, confirming the change in trajectory.
- The observed pattern shows that the lateral distance has decreased from 1.26 m to 0.81 m, indicating a closer proximity on the lateral dimension over time.

**TTC and MDC Calculations:**
- **TTC (Time-to-Collision):**
  - Longitudinal: Relative longitudinal velocity at 0.9s is 0.04 m/s moving away (effectively infinite TTC).
  - Lateral: Relative lateral velocity at 0.9s is 0.79 m/s. With the lateral distance at 0.81 m, TTC (lateral) ≈ 0.81 m / 0.79 m/s ≈ 1.03 seconds.

- **MDC (Minimum Distance to Collision):**
  - Longitudinal and lateral movement suggest increasing distance. Therefore, MDC is not primarily constrained by a converging path.
  - MDC primarily assessed on lateral proximity: 0.81 m

**Risk Assessment:**
- Lateral TTC is approx. 1.03 seconds.
- MDC (lateral) approximately 0.81 m.
  
Considering that the closest dimension (lateral) yields a TTC just over 1 second and MDC less than 1 meter, the risk is assessed based on these tight constraints.

### Risk Classification:
- **TTC (lateral) ≈ 1.03 s:** Just crosses the boundary between high risk (2) and medium risk (3).
- **MDC (lateral) ≈ 0.81 m:** Places it in a high risk (2) category.

The scores from both assessments lean towards a high risk situation mainly due to the reduced lateral proximity even while the obstacle is moving away longitudinally.

### JSON Summary:
```json
{
    "CollisionObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "",
        "OverallRiskScore": "-1"
    },
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "",
        "OverallRiskScore": "-1"
    },
    "HighRiskObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "30220",
        "OverallRiskScore": "2"
    }
}
```

The JSON summary indicates that Obstacle 30220 presents a high risk due to its close lateral proximity, despite the longitudinal distance being stable or increasing. The obstacle's current and projected path suggests no imminent collision but a risk that should not be ignored.
