At t=0.9s, the ego vehicle is at (116.04, 70.84) and the obstacle is at (110.58, 52.99).  While the distance between them is still significant, both vehicles are decelerating.  Reviewing the trajectories suggests the ego vehicle is moving slightly towards the obstacle's path. More information is needed, such as lanelet geometry and vehicle sizes, to determine if their paths will intersect soon.  Given the limited data, the current risk is assessed as medium (3) or lower, requiring further monitoring but not immediate evasive action.
