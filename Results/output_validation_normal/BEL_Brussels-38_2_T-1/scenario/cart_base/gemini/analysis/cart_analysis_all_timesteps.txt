At t=0.9s, the ego vehicle is at (116.04, 70.84) and the obstacle is at (110.58, 52.99).  While the distance is still significant, both vehicles are decelerating and the ego vehicle's deceleration is less predictable, fluctuating between -1 and -3 m/sÂ².  However, based on current positions and velocities, a collision within the next second is unlikely.  Further data points are needed to ascertain whether the risk level increases.  Therefore, the current risk is assessed as medium (3) or lower.
