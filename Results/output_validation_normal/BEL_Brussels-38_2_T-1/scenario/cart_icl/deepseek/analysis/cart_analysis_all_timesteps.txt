### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:
- **Obstacle ID**: 30220.0  
  - **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is in a different lanelet (1272.0) than the ego vehicle (55.0). The Euclidean distance between them is approximately 17.9 meters (sqrt((116.0397 - 110.576)^2 + (70.8413 - 52.9969)^2)), which is significant. Over the past timesteps, the obstacle has been moving away from the ego vehicle's trajectory.  
  - **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)  
  - **Time Risk reason**: The obstacle's velocity (4.4963 m/s) is lower than the ego's (4.3827 m/s), and the relative velocity is minimal. The obstacle is decelerating (-2.6752 m/s²), while the ego is also decelerating (-1.1001 m/s²). The trajectories are diverging.  
  - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)  
  - **Overall Risk score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)  

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. **Lanelet Check**: Ego is in lanelet 55.0; obstacle is in lanelet 1272.0 (no overlap).  
2. **Trajectory Analysis**: Obstacle is moving southward, while ego is moving northwest. Their paths are not converging.  
3. **Distance Trend**: Distance between ego and obstacle is increasing over time.  
4. **Velocity/Acceleration**: Both vehicles are decelerating, with no risk of sudden convergence.
