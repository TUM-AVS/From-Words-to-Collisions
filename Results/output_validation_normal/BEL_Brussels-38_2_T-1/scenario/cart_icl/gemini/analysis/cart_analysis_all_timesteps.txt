### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 30219.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is far from ego vehicle and moving away.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Relative velocity indicates no imminent risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 30220.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is moderately far from ego and the lateral distance is significant.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: While the obstacle is in a different lanelet and moving slower, the relative velocities and distance warrant continued monitoring.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- Obstacle ID: 30222.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is moderately close laterally, but stationary.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: Obstacle is stationary, posing no immediate time-related risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 4


### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. At the last timestep (0.9s), no obstacle shares the same lanelet as the ego vehicle (lanelet 55).
2. Obstacle 30219.0 is far away and moving further, posing no risk.
3. Obstacle 30220.0, while closer, is in a different lanelet (1272) and moving slower than the ego vehicle, reducing risk.
4. Obstacle 30222.0 is stationary and not in the ego's lane, thus posing no immediate collision risk despite lateral proximity.
5. Therefore, this is not a collision scenario.
