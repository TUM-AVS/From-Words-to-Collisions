### Obstacle Analysis:

#### Obstacle ID: 30219.0
- **Distance Risk Reason**: This obstacle is located at a significant distance from the ego vehicle, with no indication across previous timesteps of converging into the ego vehicle's lanelet or path.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 5
- **Time Risk Reason**: The obstacle maintains a consistent velocity with minimal changes to acceleration. It is not on a collision course within the measured period.
- **Time Safety Score**: 5
- **Overall Risk Score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 30220.0
- **Distance Risk Reason**: Situated far from the ego vehicle, maintaining a largely parallel trajectory that doesn't threaten a lane change or lanelet merge in the immediate future.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 5
- **Time Risk Reason**: Stable movement with small fluctuations in velocity indicating no adjustment toward the ego's trajectory.
- **Time Safety Score**: 5
- **Overall Risk Score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 30222.0
- **Distance Risk Reason**: Though this obstacle is near in terms of x-coordinates, it remains stationary with zero velocity, significantly minimizing potential collision risk with the ego that continues a different trajectory.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 4
- **Time Risk Reason**: Due to its stationary state and recent tendency toward a negligible velocity, it doesn't pose a temporal collision threat.
- **Time Safety Score**: 5
- **Overall Risk Score**: 4

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
- **Step 1**: Assess the positions and trajectories of all obstacles relative to the ego vehicle over the past timesteps.
- **Step 2**: Calculate relative positioning and velocity to discern potential intersections between paths.
- **Step 3**: Determine distance and time safety scores for each obstacle.
- **Step 4**: Conclude whether a collision is possible based on cumulative risk scores.
