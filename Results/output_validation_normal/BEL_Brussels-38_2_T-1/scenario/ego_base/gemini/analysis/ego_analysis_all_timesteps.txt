Obstacle 30220 is moving away laterally to the left and longitudinally from the ego vehicle. The longitudinal relative velocity is small (0.04 m/s) and the distance is relatively large (14.00 m). While the lateral distance is smaller (0.81 m), the obstacle is moving away laterally. This suggests a low risk of collision.
