### Obstacle-by-Obstacle Analysis (Most Recent Timestep: 0.9s)

#### Obstacle 30220 (Front-left of ego car)
- **Adjusted Distances**: Longitudinal = 14.00 m, Lateral = 0.81 m  
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal = 0.04 m/s (moving away), Lateral = 0.79 m/s (moving left, away from ego)  
- **Motion Description**: Obstacle is moving away longitudinally and laterally to the left.  

#### Trajectory Analysis (Across Timesteps)
1. **Longitudinal Motion**:  
   - Initially approaching (negative relative velocity) until 0.5s, then starts moving away (positive relative velocity).  
   - Distance stabilizes around 14.00 m by 0.6s.  
   - No longitudinal convergence in recent timesteps.  

2. **Lateral Motion**:  
   - Consistently moving left (away from ego) with positive lateral velocity.  
   - Lateral distance decreases slightly from 1.26 m (0.1s) to 0.81 m (0.9s), but the trend shows divergence.  

#### Risk Assessment
1. **Time-to-Collision (TTC)**  
   - **Longitudinal TTC**: Not applicable (relative velocity is positive; moving away).  
   - **Lateral TTC**: Not applicable (relative velocity is positive; moving away).  

2. **Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC)**  
   - **Longitudinal MDC**: 14.00 m (No Risk, MDC > 5.0 m).  
   - **Lateral MDC**: 0.81 m (Medium Risk, 0.5 < MDC â‰¤ 1.0 m).  
   - **Overall MDC**: 0.81 m (Medium Risk).  

3. **Acceleration Trends**  
   - Longitudinal acceleration fluctuates but remains low.  
   - Lateral acceleration shows the obstacle is actively moving away.  

#### Overall Risk Score  
- **Highest Risk**: Medium Risk (3) based on lateral MDC.  
- **No Extreme Risk (1) or Collision (0) indicators**:  
   - No convergence in trajectories.  
   - Distances are stable or increasing.  

### Final Determination  
- **No Collision Scenario**:  
   - No obstacle has a risk score of 0 or 1.  
   - All distances are stable or diverging.
