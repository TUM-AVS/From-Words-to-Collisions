Obstacle 30220 Analysis:

Trajectory Analysis: Over the past 0.9 seconds, obstacle 30220 has been approaching the ego vehicle longitudinally while moving away laterally to the left. Initially, the longitudinal relative velocity was negative (approaching), but it has become positive in the most recent timesteps, indicating the obstacle is now moving away longitudinally.  The lateral relative velocity remains positive, indicating continued lateral separation.

At t=0.9s:
- Longitudinal distance: 14.00m
- Lateral distance: 0.81m
- Longitudinal relative velocity: 0.04 m/s (moving away)
- Lateral relative velocity: 0.79 m/s (moving away)

TTC Calculation:
- Longitudinal TTC: 14.00m / 0.04 m/s = 350s (Not applicable for collision risk as they are moving apart)
- Lateral TTC: 0.81m / 0.79 m/s â‰ˆ 1.03s

MDC Calculation: Since the obstacle is front-left and moving away in both directions, the MDC will be based on the lateral distance, which is 0.81m.

Risk Assessment:
- Longitudinal Risk: No risk (5) due to increasing distance.
- Lateral Risk: Medium Risk (3) due to TTC being slightly above 1 second, and lateral distance < 3m.

Overall Risk: Medium Risk (3) -  The overall risk is dominated by the lateral assessment, even though there is no longitudinal collision risk.


Collision Scenario Determination:

This is NOT a collision scenario. No obstacle has a risk score of 0 or 1.
