The ego vehicle and obstacle 30221.0 are in the same lanelet (55.0).  The obstacle's x-coordinate is consistently higher than the ego vehicle's, suggesting the obstacle is ahead of the ego vehicle. However, the y-coordinates suggest they are moving closer together laterally. The distance between them is decreasing over time. While not colliding in the given timeframe, the continuously decreasing distance and lateral movement raise concerns about a potential collision if these trends continue. By 0.9 seconds, the obstacle is approximately 5.7 meters ahead and 3.7 meters laterally displaced from the ego vehicle, and the closing velocities are a concern. This warrants a high-risk assessment.
