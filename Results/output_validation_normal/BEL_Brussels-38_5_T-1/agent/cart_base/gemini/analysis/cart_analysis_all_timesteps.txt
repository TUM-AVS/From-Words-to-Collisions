The ego vehicle and obstacle 30221.0 are in the same lanelet (55.0).  The obstacle starts considerably further ahead and to the right of the ego vehicle. While the obstacle's x-coordinate decreases more slowly than the ego vehicle's, the difference in their y-coordinates is also decreasing over time.  This indicates a possible lateral movement of the obstacle towards the ego vehicle's path, increasing the risk of a collision. Further, both the ego vehicle and the obstacle are decelerating, with fluctuating accelerations for both. This adds complexity to the risk assessment as constant deceleration rates are not observed. Although the exact distance is not calculable without more precise heading information, the decreasing separation combined with the fluctuating decelerations requires close monitoring.  The risk appears to be increasing over the observed time steps. At 0.9 seconds, the lateral distance is shrinking and could potentially lead to a high-risk situation very soon.
