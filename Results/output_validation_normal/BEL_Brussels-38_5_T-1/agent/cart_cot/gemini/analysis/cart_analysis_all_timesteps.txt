At t=0.9s, the ego vehicle is at (116.839, 72.5631) with a velocity of 6.7909 and the obstacle (ID: 30221.0) is at (122.5054, 83.291) with a velocity of 7.3035. The obstacle is located to the northeast of the ego vehicle.

Analyzing the trajectories from the provided data, both the ego vehicle and the obstacle appear to be moving in roughly the same general direction (slightly south-easterly based on decreasing y-coordinates and x coordinates changing inconsistently, potentially due to lane following behavior), but the obstacle is consistently positioned further north and east of the ego vehicle.

**Calculations and Reasoning:**

While precise TTC and MDC calculations require more sophisticated models accounting for varying accelerations and orientations (which are not explicitly given but can be inferred as relatively stable from the provided data), we can approximate these values:

* **Approximate MDC:**  At t=0.9s, the distance between the ego and the obstacle is approximately sqrt((122.5054 - 116.839)^2 + (83.291 - 72.5631)^2) = ~12.1. This indicates a significant separation.  Looking back at the data, the distance between the ego vehicle and obstacle does not appear to be decreasing at a rate that suggests imminent danger or collision at the next timestep.

* **Approximate TTC (Longitudinal and Lateral):** Given the current velocities and positions, and considering they are moving in a relatively similar direction, a simple TTC calculation based solely on closing velocity would likely overestimate the actual time to collision.  More importantly, the trajectories do not suggest a collision course within the next few timesteps.

**Risk Assessment:**

Based on the trajectories, velocities, and distances, at t=0.9s, the risk of collision is low.  Though the obstacle and ego are in the same lanelet, they are significantly separated, both in terms of longitudinal and lateral distance.  The dynamics observed so far don't suggest an imminent collision, although continuous monitoring is necessary, as the relatively unpredictable accelerations could influence future positions.

**Prediction at t=1.0s:**

Given the relatively consistent but not constant acceleration of the obstacle and the ego, and the relatively stable orientations given, we would predict the ego vehicle and obstacle would continue to travel in their respective trajectories.  The gap in y coordinate seems to indicate a lane change or a similar maneuver might eventually be required or in process, though more data is needed to determine this for certain. The obstacle does not pose a collision threat in the next timestep.
