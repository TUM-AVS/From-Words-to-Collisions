### Analysis:

1. **Ego Vehicle (30220.0) and Obstacle (30221.0) Trajectories**:
   - The ego vehicle is decelerating (negative acceleration) and moving in the negative Y-direction (decreasing Y-coordinate).
   - The obstacle is also decelerating (negative acceleration) and moving in the negative Y-direction (decreasing Y-coordinate).
   - Both vehicles are in the same lanelet (55.0), indicating a potential for collision if their paths converge.

2. **Relative Motion**:
   - At 0.9 seconds, the ego vehicle is at (116.839, 72.5631) and the obstacle is at (122.5054, 83.291).
   - The lateral distance (X-coordinate difference) is ~5.6664m, and the longitudinal distance (Y-coordinate difference) is ~10.7279m.
   - The ego vehicle's velocity is 6.7909 m/s, and the obstacle's velocity is 7.3035 m/s.
   - The relative velocity (obstacle velocity - ego velocity) is ~0.5126 m/s (obstacle is moving faster than the ego vehicle).

3. **Time to Collision (TTC)**:
   - TTC = Longitudinal Distance / Relative Velocity = 10.7279 / 0.5126 â‰ˆ 20.93 seconds.
   - This TTC is very high, indicating no immediate risk of collision.

4. **Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC)**:
   - Given the lateral distance (~5.6664m) and the fact that both vehicles are in the same lanelet, the MDC is sufficiently large to avoid collision.

5. **Risk Assessment**:
   - The TTC and MDC indicate that the obstacle is not an immediate threat.
   - The overall risk is **Low (4)** as the vehicles are moving in the same direction with a safe distance and no significant convergence in paths.
