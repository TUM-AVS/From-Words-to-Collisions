At t=0.9s, the ego vehicle is at (116.839, 72.5631) with a velocity of 6.7909 m/s and the obstacle (ID 30221) is at (122.5054, 83.291) with a velocity of 7.3035 m/s.  Both are in the same lanelet (55).

The lateral distance is approximately sqrt((122.5054 - 116.839)^2 + (83.291 - 72.5631)^2) = 11.85m.  This suggests they are not immediately close laterally. However, the longitudinal positions indicate the obstacle might be slightly ahead and to the side of the ego vehicle.  More information about vehicle sizes and lanelet geometry is needed to definitively determine the lateral risk.

The given data does not provide sufficient information for a comprehensive TTC calculation. We need the relative velocity vectors projected along the direction connecting the two vehicles' centers.  While both absolute velocities are available, we lack precise heading information to accurately compute relative longitudinal velocity.  Therefore, a precise TTC calculation isn't feasible with the provided data.

Based on the available data, there's no indication of an immediate collision. However, the continuous decrease in distance between the vehicles and the uncertainty about their relative heading warrant a closer look. Given the limited information, I'd rate the risk as **Medium (3)** for now, emphasizing the need for more data to conduct a more thorough analysis.
