Obstacle 30221 is behind the ego vehicle and moving closer, but it is still approximately 7.62 meters away longitudinally.  The lateral distance is zero, meaning it's directly behind or the lateral movement is unknown. While it is approaching the ego vehicle, the relative longitudinal velocity is 0.51 m/s, suggesting a slow approach.  Given the current distance and relative velocity, there is no immediate danger of a collision.  This warrants monitoring but doesn't pose a high or extreme risk at this moment.
