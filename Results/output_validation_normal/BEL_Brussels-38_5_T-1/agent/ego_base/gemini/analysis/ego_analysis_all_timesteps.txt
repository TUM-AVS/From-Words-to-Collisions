At t=0.9s, obstacle 30221 is behind the ego vehicle, moving towards it at a relative longitudinal velocity of 0.51 m/s.  The lateral velocity is small (0.15 m/s) and decreasing, and the lateral distance is zero, suggesting the obstacle is essentially directly behind the ego vehicle. The longitudinal distance is -7.62m, meaning it's about 7.62 meters behind. Although the obstacle is approaching, the relative velocity is low and the distance is not extremely close.  This doesn't represent a collision, extreme, or even high risk at this moment. The risk is low because there's ample time and distance to react.
