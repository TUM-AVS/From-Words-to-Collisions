### Obstacle Analysis: 30221

#### Trajectory Analysis:
- **Initial Position (0.1s):** Behind ego, longitudinal distance: -6.98m, lateral distance: 0.00m, moving away longitudinally (relative velocity: -2.50 m/s).
- **Mid Position (0.5s):** Behind ego, longitudinal distance: -7.67m, lateral distance: 0.00m, moving away longitudinally (relative velocity: -0.02 m/s).
- **Final Position (0.9s):** Behind ego, longitudinal distance: -7.62m, lateral distance: 0.00m, moving toward ego longitudinally (relative velocity: 0.51 m/s).

#### Key Observations:
1. **Longitudinal Distance:** Adjusted distance is -7.62m (behind ego). The obstacle is moving toward the ego at 0.51 m/s.
2. **Lateral Distance:** 0.00m (exact alignment, same lane).
3. **Relative Velocity:** Longitudinal: 0.51 m/s (approaching), Lateral: 0.15 m/s (minimal lateral movement).
4. **Acceleration:** Longitudinal: 0.83 m/s² (increasing approach speed), Lateral: 1.81 m/s² (minimal impact).

#### Risk Assessment:
1. **Time-to-Collision (TTC):**
   - TTC = Distance / Relative Velocity = 7.62 / 0.51 ≈ 14.94 seconds (very high, no immediate risk).
   - Since TTC > 5.0s, this indicates **Negligible Risk (5)**.

2. **Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC):**
   - The obstacle is longitudinally aligned (lateral distance = 0.00m), so MDC is the longitudinal distance: 7.62m.
   - Since MDC > 5.0m, this indicates **Negligible Risk (5)**.

3. **Motion Description:** The obstacle is moving toward the ego but at a very slow rate (0.51 m/s) and from a significant distance (7.62m). The lateral movement is negligible (0.15 m/s).

#### Overall Risk:
- Both TTC and MDC indicate **Negligible Risk (5)**.
- No collision or extreme risk is present.
