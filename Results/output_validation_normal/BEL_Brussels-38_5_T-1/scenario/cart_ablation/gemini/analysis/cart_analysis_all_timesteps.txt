At t=0.9s, the ego vehicle is at (116.839, 72.5631) and the obstacle (ID 30221.0) is at (122.5054, 83.291). While the obstacle is somewhat further away in the y-axis, the x-positions are converging.  Examining the trajectories, both ego and the obstacle are in the same lane (55.0). The ego's velocity is decreasing while the obstacle's velocity, though also decreasing, remains higher. The x-distance is closing and given their current velocities and accelerations, a collision is not imminent in the next immediate timestep, but the risk is high.  The distance is less than 6 meters, and the closing speed is significant.  Therefore, I classify this as a High Risk (2) situation, but not Extreme (1) in the very next timestep.
