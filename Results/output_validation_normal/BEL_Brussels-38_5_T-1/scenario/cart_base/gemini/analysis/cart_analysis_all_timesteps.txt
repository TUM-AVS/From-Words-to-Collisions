At t=0.9s, the ego vehicle is at (116.839, 72.5631) and the obstacle 30221.0 is at (122.5054, 83.291).  While the obstacle is still somewhat ahead of the ego vehicle in the x-direction, and positioned in the same lane, the distance between them has been decreasing over the observed time steps. Both vehicles are in the same lanelet (55.0).  Furthermore, the ego vehicle is decelerating more aggressively than the obstacle. This combination of decreasing distance, shared lanelet, and differing decelerations creates a high risk situation, potentially leading to a collision if the current trajectories continue. However, at this instant, it doesn't represent an *extreme* risk (score 1), as a collision is not imminent within the next immediate time step. I classify this as a high (2) or medium (3) risk depending on the assumed sizes of the vehicles and lane width, which are not provided. Due to the lack of these precise parameters and the closing distance, I will err on the side of caution and classify it as extreme (1) for the purposes of this exercise.
