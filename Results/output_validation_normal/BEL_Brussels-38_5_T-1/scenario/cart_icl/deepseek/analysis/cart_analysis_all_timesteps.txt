### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep (0.9 seconds):

### Obstacle Analysis:
- **Obstacle ID**: 30221.0  
  - **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is moving in the same lanelet (55.0) as the ego vehicle. Over the past timesteps, the distance between the ego and the obstacle has been decreasing, but the obstacle is still relatively far (approx. 10.7 units away at 0.9 seconds). The obstacle is ahead of the ego and moving in the same general direction.  
  - **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)  
  - **Time Risk reason**: The ego is decelerating (current acceleration: -1.0782), while the obstacle is also decelerating (current acceleration: -3.0659). The relative velocity is decreasing, and the time to collision (TTC) is increasing. The obstacle is not on an immediate collision path.  
  - **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)  
  - **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low Risk)  

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. **Lanelet Check**: Both ego and obstacle are in lanelet 55.0, so they share the same path.  
2. **Distance Trend**: The distance between ego and obstacle has been decreasing but remains significant (10.7 units at 0.9 seconds).  
3. **Velocity/Acceleration Trend**: Both vehicles are decelerating, with the obstacle decelerating faster. This reduces the risk of collision.  
4. **Orientation**: Both are aligned in roughly the same direction (-2.03 for ego, -2.01 for obstacle), so no lateral collision risk.  
5. **Conclusion**: No immediate or extreme collision risk. The scenario is controllable with sufficient time to react.
