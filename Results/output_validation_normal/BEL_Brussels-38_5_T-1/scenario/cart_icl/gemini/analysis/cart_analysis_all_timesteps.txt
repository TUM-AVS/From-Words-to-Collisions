### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 30219.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 30219.0 is in a different lanelet (686.0) than the ego vehicle (55.0) and maintains a significant lateral distance throughout the provided timesteps.  Its y-coordinate remains far from the ego vehicle's y-coordinate.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason:  The obstacle's velocity and acceleration show no indication of potential lane change or movement toward the ego vehicle's path.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 30221.0
- Distance Risk reason: This obstacle is in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle. While initially behind, it is getting closer to the ego vehicle over the timesteps, as evidenced by their x and y coordinates.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: The obstacle's velocity is consistently higher than the ego vehicle's, and its acceleration is positive in recent timesteps, indicating it's gaining speed.  This suggests a potential rear-end collision if the ego vehicle decelerates further.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. Identified two obstacles: 30219.0 and 30221.0.
2. Obstacle 30219.0 consistently remains in a different lane and poses no risk throughout the observed timesteps.
3. Obstacle 30221.0, while in the same lane, shows a decreasing distance to the ego vehicle and a higher velocity, increasing the risk of a rear-end collision over time.  However, at the most recent timestep, it's not an immediate collision threat.

### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
  "CollisionObstacles": [],
  "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null,
  "ScenarioAnalysis": {
    "IsCollisionScenario": false,
    "Reasoning": "No obstacle presents an immediate collision risk at the most recent timestep. While Obstacle 30221.0 shows a medium risk due to its closing distance and higher velocity in the same lane, it is not yet a collision."
