### Obstacle Analysis:

#### Obstacle ID: 30219.0
- **Distance Risk Reason:** The obstacle is consistently in a separate lanelet (686.0), with significant lateral distance and no direct trajectory overlap with the ego vehicle.
- **Distance Safety Score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)
- **Time Risk Reason:** The obstacle has maintained a relatively stable velocity and trajectory. Its velocity is lower compared to the ego vehicle, and it is not closing the gap rapidly.
- **Time Safety Score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)
- **Overall Risk Score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)

#### Obstacle ID: 30221.0
- **Distance Risk Reason:** This obstacle is situated in the same lanelet (55.0) as the ego vehicle, indicating potential for interaction. Over time, the distance has decreased due to the opposing directions, although not to an immediate collision range.
- **Distance Safety Score:** 3 (Medium Risk)
- **Time Risk Reason:** The obstacle has been accelerating, increasing its velocity over time. However, the velocities have been relatively similar, reducing the immediate risk of collision.
- **Time Safety Score:** 3 (Medium Risk)
- **Overall Risk Score:** 3 (Medium Risk)

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. **Position Analysis:** The ego vehicle is in lanelet 55.0 alongside obstacle 30221.0, indicating potential for conflict. In contrast, obstacle 30219.0 remains in lanelet 686.0, away from the ego vehicle's path.
2. **Trajectory and Position Changes:** Over the past timesteps, obstacle 30221.0 showed increased speed, and its distance relative to the ego vehicle decreased slightly. Obstacle 30219.0 maintained a separate path.
3. **Risk Levels:** Although obstacle 30221.0 is in the same lanelet, both position and velocity suggest that while risk is present, it's not immediate. Obstacle 30219.0 poses negligible risk.
4. **Conclusion:** The scenario is not a collision scenario, and no obstacles are at extreme risk levels.
