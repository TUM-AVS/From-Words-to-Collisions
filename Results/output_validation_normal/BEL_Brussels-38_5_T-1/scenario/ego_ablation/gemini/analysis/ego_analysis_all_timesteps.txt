Obstacle 30221 is behind the ego vehicle and approaching it longitudinally, but it is still relatively far behind (-7.62 m).  While the lateral velocity and acceleration suggest some lateral movement, the lateral distance remains 0.0, indicating continued alignment with the ego vehicle's path. The longitudinal relative velocity is small (0.51 m/s) and the obstacle is still some distance behind, suggesting there is no immediate danger. Thus, there is no collision risk.
