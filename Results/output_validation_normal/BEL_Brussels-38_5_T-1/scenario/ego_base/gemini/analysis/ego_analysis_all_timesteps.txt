At t=0.9s, obstacle 30221 is behind the ego vehicle, moving towards it at a relative longitudinal velocity of 0.51 m/s.  The lateral velocity is small (0.15 m/s) and decreasing, and the lateral distance is zero, suggesting the obstacle is almost directly behind the ego vehicle. While the obstacle is approaching, the relative longitudinal velocity is low and the distance is still significant (-7.62m).  This situation does not represent an immediate collision risk, but requires monitoring.
