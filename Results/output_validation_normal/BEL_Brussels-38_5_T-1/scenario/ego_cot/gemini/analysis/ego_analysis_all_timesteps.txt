### Safety analysis for timestep 0.9 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:
- **Obstacle ID:** 30221
- **Distance Risk reason:** The obstacle is behind the ego vehicle at a lateral and longitudinal distance of approximately -7.62m.  While it is approaching, it is still a safe distance behind.
- **Distance safety score:** 5
- **Time Risk reason:** The obstacle is moving towards the ego vehicle longitudinally (0.51 m/s) and laterally (0.15 m/s). However, given the current distance and relatively slow speed, a collision is unlikely in the immediate future.  We don't have enough information to accurately calculate TTC without knowing the ego vehicle's speed and planned trajectory. It's likely on a converging trajectory but not yet a high risk.
- **Time safety score:** 4
- **Overall Risk score:** 4
