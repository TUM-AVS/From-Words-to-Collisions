### Obstacle-by-Obstacle Analysis (Most Recent Timestep: 0.9s)

#### Obstacle 30221:
- **Position**: Behind ego (longitudinal = -7.62m, lateral = 0.00m)
- **Relative Velocity**: longitudinal = 0.51 m/s (approaching), lateral = 0.15 m/s (minimal lateral movement)
- **Motion Description**: "Obstacle is driving toward the ego car from behind. Exact lateral alignment or unknown case."
- **Trajectory Analysis**:
  - From 0.0s to 0.5s: Obstacle was moving away longitudinally (distance increased from -6.98m to -7.69m).
  - From 0.6s to 0.9s: Obstacle began approaching longitudinally (distance decreased from -7.69m to -7.62m).
  - Lateral distance remains 0.00m throughout, indicating exact alignment.

#### TTC Calculation:
- **Longitudinal TTC**: 
  - Distance = 7.62m (absolute value)
  - Relative Velocity = 0.51 m/s (approaching)
  - TTC = 7.62 / 0.51 â‰ˆ 14.94 seconds
- **Lateral TTC**: 
  - Distance = 0.00m (aligned)
  - Relative Velocity = 0.15 m/s (minimal)
  - TTC is technically 0, but since lateral velocity is very low and not converging dangerously, this does not indicate immediate risk.

#### MDC Calculation:
- Since the obstacle is directly behind (lateral = 0.00m), MDC is effectively the longitudinal distance (7.62m).

#### Risk Assessment:
- **TTC**: 14.94s (No Risk, score = 5)
- **MDC**: 7.62m (No Risk, score = 5)
- **Overall Risk**: No Risk (score = 5)

### Collision Scenario Determination:
- No obstacle has a risk score of 0 (collision) or 1 (extreme risk).
- Obstacle 30221 is approaching very slowly from behind with a large distance and no immediate danger.
