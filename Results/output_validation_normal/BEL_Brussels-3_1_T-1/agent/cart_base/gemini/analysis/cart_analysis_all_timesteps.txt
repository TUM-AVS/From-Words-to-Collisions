Here's the analysis and the JSON output:

**Analysis:**

Obstacle 30243.0 (initially in lanelet 1615, later 552): This obstacle starts relatively far from the ego vehicle but its y-position is consistently decreasing, indicating movement in a direction that could eventually pose a risk.  While not immediately colliding, the consistent decrease in y-position along with the ego vehicle's trajectory warrants closer monitoring.  The change in lanelet for this obstacle also suggests a potential lane change maneuver, which introduces more uncertainty and potential risk.  Therefore, this is currently assesed as a medium risk.

Obstacle 30245.0 (lanelets 805 and 807): This obstacle's x-position is significantly different from the ego vehicle's, and its y-position does not indicate a direct collision course in the near future.  Although the lanelet changes from 805 to 807, the lateral separation remains substantial. Thus, the risk associated with this obstacle is currently low.

**No immediate collisions are detected in the given timeframe.**  However, continuous monitoring is needed, especially for obstacle 30243.0.
