At t=0.9s, the ego vehicle is at (-226.6746, 268.0629) with a velocity of 3.4898 and acceleration of -1.8814.  Let's analyze the two obstacles:

**Obstacle 30243.0:** Position (-238.4493, 241.0809), velocity 9.4336, acceleration -0.6506.

* **Lateral Risk:** The y-coordinate difference is substantial (268.0629 - 241.0809 = 26.982).  Given the current velocities and assuming lane boundaries, a lateral collision is unlikely in the immediate future.
* **Longitudinal Risk:** The x-coordinate difference is -11.7747. Obstacle 30243.0 is behind the ego vehicle and moving faster.  We need to estimate TTC.  A simplified TTC calculation (ignoring acceleration) is distance/relative velocity = 11.7747/(9.4336 - 3.4898) =  2.0 seconds approximately. This suggests a low longitudinal risk in the very immediate future (next second). However, due to deceleration the vehicle will slow down, increasing risk at a later time.  A more precise TTC calculation is needed to confirm safety beyond the next few seconds.

**Obstacle 30245.0:** Position (-218.2021, 248.8587), velocity 6.3426, acceleration -0.3367.

* **Lateral Risk:**  The y-coordinate difference is significant (268.0629 - 248.8587 = 19.2042). Considering likely lane boundaries, immediate lateral collision is unlikely.
* **Longitudinal Risk:** The x-coordinate difference is 8.4725. The ego vehicle is ahead of the obstacle but decelerating faster than the obstacle.  A simplified TTC (ignoring acceleration) is 8.4725/(6.3426 - 3.4898) =  2.95 seconds approximately.  This indicates no immediate collision risk.

**Overall Assessment at t=0.9s:**

While neither obstacle presents an *immediate* collision risk, obstacle 30243.0 poses a higher risk than obstacle 30245.0 because it is approaching from behind at a higher velocity and the ego vehicle is also decelerating which complicates the situation.  More detailed analysis (incorporating acceleration and lane boundaries) and future time steps are required to accurately assess the risk beyond the next second or two, especially regarding obstacle 30243.0. It is possible that the longitudinal TTC calculation drops quickly in the following seconds and hence the collision risk may increase quickly. As such there is a moderate risk with obstacle 30243.0 and a low risk with obstacle 30245.0.
