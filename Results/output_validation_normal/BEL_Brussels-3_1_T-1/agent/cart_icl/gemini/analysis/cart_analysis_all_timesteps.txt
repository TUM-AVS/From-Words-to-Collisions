At t=0.9s, the ego vehicle continues decelerating within lanelet 1386. Let's analyze the obstacles:

* **Obstacle 30243:** Located in lanelet 552, this obstacle is moving roughly parallel to the ego vehicle but with a greater y-coordinate (meaning it's likely in an adjacent lane).  While the provided data doesn't offer precise lane geometry or obstacle dimensions, the consistent lateral separation suggests a low risk of collision.  The obstacle's deceleration at this timestep further reduces concern.

* **Obstacle 30245:**  This obstacle is in lanelet 807, exhibiting fluctuating velocity and acceleration values, indicating unstable motion.  However, its x and y coordinates show a consistent separation from the ego vehicle's path, suggesting no imminent collision risk. Additional information about road geometry and lane configurations would be beneficial for a more definitive assessment.

Considering the final provided timestep (0.9s) and the trends observed:

* No obstacles pose an immediate collision risk.
* Obstacle 30243, while in a different lane, maintains a safe distance and shows no sign of erratic behavior.
* Obstacle 30245, despite variable motion, also remains adequately separated from the ego vehicle's trajectory.

Therefore, based on the provided data and focusing on the most recent timestep (0.9 seconds), all obstacles are assessed with an overall risk score of 5.
