At t=0.9s, Obstacle 30243 is moving away from the ego vehicle, posing no risk. Obstacle 30245, however, is approaching the ego vehicle both longitudinally and laterally. While the distance is still around 13.8 meters laterally and 9.8 meters longitudinally, the continuous approach combined with the relative velocities suggests a potential high risk if this trend continues. More information about the ego vehicle's intended trajectory and potential actions would be needed for a definitive assessment. For now, Obstacle 30245 is flagged as a high risk.
