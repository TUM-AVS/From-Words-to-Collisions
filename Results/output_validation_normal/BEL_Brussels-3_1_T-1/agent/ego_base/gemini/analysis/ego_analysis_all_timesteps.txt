Obstacle 30245 is approaching the ego vehicle both longitudinally and laterally.  At the last timestep (0.9 seconds), it is only 9.76m ahead and 13.78m to the left, and its longitudinal velocity suggests it is still moving closer. While its longitudinal velocity has decreased, the distance is quite small, suggesting a high risk of collision if the current trajectories continue. Obstacle 30243 is moving away from the ego vehicle and presents no risk.
