### Safety analysis for timestep 0.9s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

**- Obstacle ID: 30243**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 30243 is in the front of the ego vehicle at a substantial distance (24.93m longitudinal and 24.93m lateral) and moving away.  
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: The obstacle is moving away from the ego vehicle, indicating no imminent time-to-collision risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

**- Obstacle ID: 30245**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 30245 is located at 9.76m longitudinally and 9.76m laterally in the front-left of the ego vehicle. This relatively close proximity represents a potential risk.
- Distance safety score: 2
- Time Risk reason:  While the precise TTC is difficult to determine from the given data, the closing velocities (-5.36 m/s longitudinal, -6.06 m/s lateral) and decreasing distances suggest a high risk of collision if the current trajectories persist. The obstacle's motion description confirms it's driving towards the ego vehicle both longitudinally and laterally.
- Time safety score: 2
- Overall Risk score: 2
