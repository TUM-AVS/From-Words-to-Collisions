### Obstacle-by-Obstacle Analysis

#### Obstacle 30243
- **Position:** Front of the ego vehicle
- **Trajectory Analysis:** Over the sequence, the obstacle is consistently moving away from the ego vehicle as shown by increasing longitudinal distances.
- **Most Recent Adjusted Distances:** Longitudinal 24.93 m, Lateral 0.00 m
- **Relative Velocity:** Longitudinal 5.94 m/s (moving away)
- **Motion Description:** Moving away longitudinally; exact lateral alignment or unknown case.
- **TTC Calculation:** Not applicable as the relative velocity indicates divergence.
- **MDC:** The projected longitudinal distance is continually increasing, confirming non-threat.

**Risk Assessment:** The trajectory data show the obstacle is consistently increasing its distance from the ego vehicle, and as such, poses no risk. The aligned lateral alignment is not a concern without longitudinal threat.

- **Overall Risk Score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)

#### Obstacle 30245
- **Position:** Front-left of the ego vehicle
- **Trajectory Analysis:** The obstacle is moving towards both longitudinally and laterally, closing in with negative velocities.
- **Most Recent Adjusted Distances:** Longitudinal 9.76 m, Lateral 13.78 m
- **Relative Velocity:** Longitudinal -5.36 m/s, Lateral -6.06 m/s (approaching)
- **Motion Description:** Obstacle is driving toward the ego car both longitudinally and laterally from the left.
- **TTC Calculation:** 
  - Longitudinal: \(\frac{9.76}{5.36} \approx 1.82\) seconds
  - Lateral: \(\frac{13.78}{6.06} \approx 2.27\) seconds
- **MDC Projection:** As paths converge, MDC will reduce. Current distances indicate manageable time but converging paths signal increasing risk.

**Risk Assessment:** Although both TTC values are over 1 second, they're less than 3 seconds, signaling a medium risk due to converging trajectories. 

- **Overall Risk Score:** 3 (Medium Risk)
