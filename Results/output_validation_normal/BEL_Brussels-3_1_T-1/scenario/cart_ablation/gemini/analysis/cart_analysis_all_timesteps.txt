At t=0.9s, Ego is at (-226.6746, 268.0629) and decelerating.

Obstacle 30243.0 is at (-238.4493, 241.0809), a significant distance away and moving in a different lanelet (552) than the ego vehicle (1386).  While the y-coordinate difference is substantial, the x-coordinate difference is less pronounced and warrants attention. However, given the different lanelets and the overall trajectory patterns, this obstacle doesn't pose an immediate collision risk.

Obstacle 30245.0 is at (-218.2021, 248.8587), also a reasonable distance from the ego vehicle and moving in a different lanelet (807). This obstacle also doesn't present an immediate risk.

Therefore, at t=0.9s, no obstacles pose an extreme or collision risk.
