At t=0.9s, Ego is at (-226.67, 268.06) and decelerating.

Obstacle 30243 is at (-238.45, 241.08) in lanelet 552.  The y-coordinate difference suggests they are not likely to collide soon, despite being somewhat close in x-coordinate and obstacle 30243 also decelerating. This obstacle poses no immediate collision risk.

Obstacle 30245 is at (-218.20, 248.86) in lanelet 807. Again, the significant difference in y-coordinate suggests no immediate risk, even with the slight change in lanelet.

Based on the latest timestep (0.9s), no obstacles pose an immediate collision risk.
