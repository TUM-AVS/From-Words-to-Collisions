### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep (0.9 seconds):

### Obstacle Analysis:
1. **Obstacle ID: 30243.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is moving in a parallel lanelet (1615.0 -> 552.0) and is consistently moving away from the ego vehicle in the Y-direction (from 247.9659 to 241.0809). The X-distance is decreasing but remains significant (~11.7747 units at 0.9s).
   - **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: The relative velocity is high (ego: 3.4898, obstacle: 9.4336), but the obstacle is moving away laterally. No immediate convergence in trajectories.
   - **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low Risk)

2. **Obstacle ID: 30245.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is in a different lanelet (805.0 -> 807.0) and moving away from the ego vehicle in both X and Y directions (X: -214.4645 to -218.2021, Y: 245.4078 to 248.8587). The distance is increasing over time.
   - **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: The relative velocity is moderate (ego: 3.4898, obstacle: 6.3426), and the obstacle is moving away. No risk of intersection.
   - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. **Trajectory Analysis**: Both obstacles are moving away from the ego vehicle over the observed timesteps. No convergence in paths.
2. **Lanelet Context**: Ego is in lanelet 1386.0, while obstacles are in 552.0 and 807.0 (no overlap).
3. **Velocity/Acceleration Trends**: Ego is decelerating, while obstacles maintain steady speeds. No sudden changes indicate collision risk.
4. **Conclusion**: No collision risk detected.
