### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 30243.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is relatively far from the ego vehicle and moving further away.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason:  Relative velocities and trajectories suggest no immediate risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 30245.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is far from the ego vehicle and poses no immediate threat.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Lateral separation is significant; no time-based risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 30246.0
- Distance Risk reason:  Although the obstacle is in a different lanelet initially, its trajectory shows it is moving towards the ego vehicle's lanelet. At the latest timestep, it's in a nearby lanelet and relatively close.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: Its changing trajectory and relatively close proximity indicate a potential risk requiring monitoring.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3


### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
No obstacles are on a direct collision course with the ego vehicle in the analyzed timesteps. Obstacle 30246.0 requires attention due to its proximity and movement towards the ego vehicle's lane, but it does not represent a collision or extreme risk at this point.


### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
  "CollisionObstacles": null,
  "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null,
  "ScenarioAnalysis": {
    "IsCollisionScenario": false,
    "Reasoning": "No obstacle is predicted to collide with the ego vehicle within the analyzed timeframe. Obstacle 30246.0 warrants monitoring due to its proximity and trajectory change, but it does not present an immediate collision risk."
  }
}
