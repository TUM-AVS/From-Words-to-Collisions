### Obstacle Analysis:

#### Obstacle ID: 30243.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: Based on its trajectory, Obstacle 30243.0 is moving consistently away in the Y direction relative to the ego vehicle's position. Its acceleration and velocity indicate it is not approaching the ego vehicle but staying on a different trajectory.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: The obstacle has maintained a high and consistent velocity without showing any signs of aggressive acceleration that might lead it onto a collision course with the ego vehicle.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 30245.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: Positioned further along the X-axis from the ego, moving steadily in its lane with consistent velocity and slight lateral displacement.
- **Distance safety score**: 4
- **Time Risk reason**: Although in general proximity, its velocity and acceleration trends indicate that it retains its lane position relative to the ego, reducing collision likelihood.
- **Time safety score**: 4
- **Overall Risk score**: 4

#### Obstacle ID: 30246.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: This obstacle stays far away on the X-axis; its trajectory remains parallel but not intersecting with the ego vehicle's path, indicated by its steady velocity and minor acceleration.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: The obstacle is not accelerating towards the ego, maintaining a steady path that diverges from the ego's trajectory.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
The risk of collision for each obstacle is negligible to low. No obstacles present an immediate threat as their paths remain diverging or parallel without any foreseeable intersection. There is no significant risk of collision at the present or in the short-term future.
