Obstacle 30245 is approaching the ego vehicle both longitudinally and laterally.  While the distance is not yet critically close in this timestep, the consistent closing velocity and the predicted positions in the near future suggest a high probability of collision if no evasive action is taken. Obstacle 30243 is moving away from the ego vehicle and poses no risk.
