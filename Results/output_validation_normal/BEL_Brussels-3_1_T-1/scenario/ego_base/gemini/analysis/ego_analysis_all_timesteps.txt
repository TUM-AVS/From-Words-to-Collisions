Obstacle 30245 is approaching the ego vehicle both longitudinally and laterally.  At the last timestep (0.9 seconds), it is only 9.76m ahead and 13.78m to the left, and its relative velocity indicates it is still moving closer. While not an immediate collision, the short distance and closing speed suggest a high risk of collision if the current trajectories continue. Obstacle 30243 is moving away from the ego vehicle and poses no risk.

**Risk Levels and Definitions:**
<Collision (Score: 0)>: Actual collision has occurred or is unavoidable within the next timestep.
<Extreme Risk (Score: 1)>: Immediate collision or very high likelihood of impact. Urgent action is required.
<High Risk (Score: 2)>: Close to collision or highly probable collision path. Needs prompt attention and quick manoeuvring.
<Medium Risk (Score: 3)>: Moderate collision risk but manageable with timely reactions and proper strategies.
<Low Risk (Score: 4)>: Minimal collision risk. The situation is controllable with sufficient time to react.
<Negligible Risk (Score: 5)>: No significant collision risk. Obstacles are either moving away or far enough not to interfere.
