### Safety analysis for timestep 0.9 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

**Assumptions and Clarifications:**

* Since adjusted distances (adjusted_d_long, adjusted_d_lat) are not provided, raw distances (DTClong, DTClat) will be used for this analysis.  This makes the analysis less precise and could lead to an inaccurate assessment of risk.  Providing adjusted distances is crucial for a robust safety assessment.
* TTC will be approximated using distance and relative velocity. If the relative velocity is positive (moving away), TTC will be considered infinite (no collision risk).  A more sophisticated TTC calculation would consider acceleration as well.
* I'm inferring "Exact lateral alignment or unknown case" to mean DTClat is not reliable and therefore lateral risk should be treated with extra caution.


### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 30243**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is in front, but DTClong (24.93m) suggests a safe distance currently.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Obstacle is moving away longitudinally (Vrel_long = 5.94 m/s).  No longitudinal collision risk. Lateral movement is unclear but current lateral distance (24.93) is large.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 30245**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is in front-left, with DTClong (9.76m) and DTClat (9.76m) indicating a close proximity. This poses a significant risk.
- Distance safety score: 2
- Time Risk reason: Obstacle is moving towards the ego vehicle both longitudinally (Vrel_long = -5.36 m/s) and laterally (Vrel_lat = -6.06 m/s).  This indicates a high risk of collision in the near future.  Approximate TTClong is 9.76m / 5.36m/s = 1.82s. Approximate TTClat is 9.76m / 6.06m/s = 1.61s.
- Time safety score: 2
- Overall Risk score: 2
