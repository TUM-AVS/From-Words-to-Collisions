### Obstacle-by-Obstacle Analysis

#### Obstacle 30243
- **Position and Movement**:
  - **Adjusted longitudinal distance**: 24.93 m
  - **Adjusted lateral distance**: 0.00 m
  - **Relative velocity**:
    - Longitudinal: 5.94 m/s (moving away)
    - Lateral: -0.22 m/s (slight lateral drift)
  - **Motion Description**: Moving away longitudinally with exact lateral alignment.

- **Trajectory Analysis**:
  - Over previous timesteps, the obstacle has been consistently moving away from the ego vehicle, suggesting a very low risk of collision due to increasing longitudinal distance.

- **TTC and MDC Calculation**:
  - **TTC (Longitudinal)**: Since the obstacle is moving away, TTC is not applicable.
  - **MDC**: Lateral alignment, thus MDC is determined by the lateral distance. Here, MDC = 0.00 m for lateral alignment.

- **Risk Assessment**:
  - Given the lateral alignment but with increasing longitudinal distance, the risk of collision is mitigated. Therefore, a low risk of interaction exists despite alignment.
  - **Overall Risk Score**: 4 (Low Risk)

#### Obstacle 30245
- **Position and Movement**:
  - **Adjusted longitudinal distance**: 9.76 m
  - **Adjusted lateral distance**: 13.78 m
  - **Relative velocity**:
    - Longitudinal: -5.36 m/s (approaching)
    - Lateral: -6.06 m/s (approaching)
  - **Motion Description**: Driving toward the ego car, both longitudinally and laterally from the left.

- **Trajectory Analysis**:
  - The obstacle has been consistently closing both longitudinally and laterally over previous timesteps.
  - Indicative of a converging path toward the ego vehicle.

- **TTC and MDC Calculation**:
  - **TTC (Longitudinal)** = 9.76 m / 5.36 m/s = 1.82 seconds
  - **TTC (Lateral)** = 13.78 m / 6.06 m/s = 2.27 seconds
  - **MDC**: The closer of the two distances dominates the risk. Given both dimensions are closing, MDC = min(9.76 m, 13.78 m) = 9.76 m (converging path).

- **Risk Assessment**:
  - Both TTC values correspond to Medium Risk, considering the converging trajectory as seen from both longitudinal and lateral movements.
  - However, given the consistent approaching path, a prudent assessment is vital.
  - **Overall Risk Score**: 3 (Medium Risk)

### Conclusion
- **Collision Scenario Determination**:
  - Neither obstacle presents an immediate collision or extreme risk (score 0 or 1).
  - The situation with Obstacle 30245, while of medium risk due to converging trajectories, does not meet criteria for extreme risk or collision.
