Obstacle 30202 is in the same lane as the ego vehicle and initially relatively close.  Over the provided timesteps, the distance between the ego and obstacle 30202 decreases, indicating a potential collision risk. While both vehicles are moving forward, the ego vehicle is decelerating significantly, while obstacle 30202's velocity fluctuates but remains relatively high.  This difference in velocity and acceleration could lead to a collision if the ego vehicle continues to decelerate or obstacle 30202 doesn't adjust its speed accordingly. This represents a high risk.
