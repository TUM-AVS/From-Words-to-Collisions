At t=0.9s, the ego vehicle is at (-152.5275, -69.3814) with a velocity of 5.3377 and acceleration of -1.2384.  Let's analyze the risk posed by each obstacle at this timestep:

* **Obstacle 30194:** Position (-180.0248, -58.1149), velocity 7.8296, acceleration 0.4349. This obstacle is relatively far from the ego vehicle and moving in a different general direction.  Given the lateral separation and differing directions, the risk of collision is low.

* **Obstacle 30198:** Position (-163.7256, -65.4926), velocity 0, acceleration 0. This obstacle is stationary and poses no immediate threat.  The risk of collision is negligible.

* **Obstacle 30199:** Position (-172.8339, -74.5811), velocity 3.8339, acceleration is -2.0277. This obstacle is also somewhat distant from the ego vehicle.  While there's some lateral separation, it's less than with Obstacle 30194. However, its slowing acceleration reduces risk, thus low.

* **Obstacle 30201:** Position (-163.4567, -54.5771), velocity 4.8175, acceleration -5.6278. The large negative acceleration of this obstacle suggests it's braking heavily. Its trajectory needs further analysis.

* **Obstacle 30202:** Position (-140.9296, -82.9568), velocity 7.9189, acceleration -3.0941.  This obstacle is in the same lane as the ego vehicle (lanelet 725) and relatively close.  Although both are decelerating, the closing velocity and proximity represent a high risk.  It is unlikely to collide because of the lateral distance, but a slight lane change could cause a lane change.
