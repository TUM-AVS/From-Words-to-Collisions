At t=0.9s, the ego vehicle (ID 30196) is located at (-152.5275, -69.3814) with a velocity of 5.3377 and acceleration of -1.2384. Let's analyze the risk posed by each obstacle:

* **Obstacle 30194:** Located at (-179.4957, -57.5396), this obstacle is far from the ego vehicle and moving in the opposite direction. It poses a negligible risk.

* **Obstacle 30198:** Stationary at (-163.7256, -65.4926), this obstacle is also relatively far from the ego vehicle's current trajectory and poses a negligible risk.

* **Obstacle 30199:** At (-171.6536, -73.4281) with a velocity of 2.8794 and acceleration of -2.2903. This obstacle is somewhat far from the ego vehicle and moving slower. Currently, it does not represent an immediate threat, but its motion should be monitored in subsequent timesteps to ensure it doesn't become a hazard. Low risk.

* **Obstacle 30201:** Located at (-163.4567, -54.5771), this obstacle is moving with a velocity of 4.8175 and decelerating at -5.6278.  While it is some distance away and in a different lanelet (830 vs. 725 for ego), its rapid deceleration warrants attention in future timesteps, though the current risk is low.

* **Obstacle 30202:** Located at (-140.9296, -82.9568), this obstacle is in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle (725).  It is traveling with a velocity of 7.9189 and decelerating at -3.0941. Its position and similar orientation indicate potential risk.  We need to calculate TTC.

**TTC for Obstacle 30202:**

* Relative X position: -140.9296 - (-152.5275) = 11.5979 m (ego is ahead)
* Relative Y position: -82.9568 - (-69.3814) = -13.5754 m (ego is to the "right", assuming a standard coordinate system)
* Relative velocity X: 7.9189 - 5.3377 = 2.5812 m/s (obstacle approaching ego)
* Distance between ego and obstacle: sqrt((11.5979)^2 + (-13.5754)^2) = 17.847m
* Simplified TTC (longitudinal only):  11.5979 / 2.5812 = 4.49 seconds (using only x-coordinates for a simplified assessment)

Given the lateral distance and the closing velocity, while the simplified TTC suggests some time before a potential collision, Obstacle 30202 presents a medium risk due to its proximity, same lane occupancy, and closing velocity. Continued monitoring is essential.
