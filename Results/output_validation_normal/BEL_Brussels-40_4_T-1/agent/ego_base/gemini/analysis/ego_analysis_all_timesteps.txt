At t=0.9s, Obstacle 30199 is closest to the ego vehicle with a longitudinal distance of 4.84m and lateral distance of 15.56m. It's approaching longitudinally at -5.14 m/s and laterally at -2.87 m/s.  Obstacle 30198 is also relatively close at 5.72m longitudinally and 4.37m laterally, approaching at -5.34 m/s longitudinally. While both are approaching, given the current velocities and distances, a collision within the next second is not guaranteed but possible if they maintain their current trajectories and speeds. Thus, they represent a high risk. Obstacle 30194 is further away and moving away laterally, presenting a lower risk. Obstacle 30201 is at 13.85m and closing slowly; it poses a medium risk. Obstacle 30202 is behind the ego vehicle and poses a low risk. No obstacle shows extreme risk or collision at this moment.
