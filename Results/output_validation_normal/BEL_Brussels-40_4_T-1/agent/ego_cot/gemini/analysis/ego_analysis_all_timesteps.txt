### Safety analysis for timestep 0.9s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

**- Obstacle ID: 30194**
- Distance Risk reason:  Obstacle is located 21.92m longitudinally and 21.92m laterally in the front-left of the ego vehicle. This distance presents no immediate risk.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: The lateral relative velocity is positive, indicating the obstacle is moving away from the ego vehicle laterally.  Longitudinally, the obstacle is approaching, but the distance is significant.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

**- Obstacle ID: 30198**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is 5.72m longitudinally and laterally from the ego vehicle in the front-left. This relatively close proximity poses a medium risk.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: The obstacle is approaching the ego vehicle longitudinally with a negative relative velocity, increasing risk. However, there's no lateral movement.
- Time safety score: 2
- Overall Risk score: 2

**- Obstacle ID: 30199**
- Distance Risk reason:  Obstacle is 4.84m longitudinally and laterally from the ego vehicle in the front-left.  This close proximity represents a high risk.
- Distance safety score: 2
- Time Risk reason: The obstacle is approaching the ego vehicle both longitudinally and laterally, significantly increasing the risk of collision.
- Time safety score: 1
- Overall Risk score: 1

**- Obstacle ID: 30201**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is 13.85m longitudinally and laterally in front of the ego vehicle, posing no immediate threat.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Although the obstacle has a negative longitudinal velocity, the magnitude is small and the distance is significant, indicating low risk. The lateral velocity is also small.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

**- Obstacle ID: 30202**
- Distance Risk reason: Located -13.35m longitudinally and laterally (behind) the ego vehicle, posing no immediate risk.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Although moving closer to the ego vehicle, the obstacle is behind and the relative velocity is manageable.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4
