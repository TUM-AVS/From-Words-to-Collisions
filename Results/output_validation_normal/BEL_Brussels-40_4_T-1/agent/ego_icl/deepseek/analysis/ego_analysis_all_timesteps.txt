Let me analyze each obstacle at the most recent timestep (0.9 seconds) with trajectory context:

1. Obstacle 30194 (Front-left):
   - Adjusted distances: longitudinal 21.92m, lateral 11.97m
   - Relative velocity: longitudinal -6.27m/s (approaching), lateral 7.77m/s (moving away)
   - Motion: Moving toward longitudinally but away laterally
   - TTC (longitudinal): 21.92/6.27 = 3.50s (Medium Risk)
   - MDC: Lateral distance increasing → No collision path
   - Overall Risk: 3 (Medium)

2. Obstacle 30198 (Front-left):
   - Adjusted distances: longitudinal 5.72m, lateral 4.37m
   - Relative velocity: longitudinal -5.34m/s (approaching), lateral 0.00m/s
   - Motion: Directly approaching longitudinally, stable laterally
   - TTC (longitudinal): 5.72/5.34 = 1.07s (High Risk)
   - MDC: Lateral distance stable at 4.37m (Low Risk)
   - Overall Risk: 2 (High)

3. Obstacle 30199 (Front-left):
   - Adjusted distances: longitudinal 4.84m, lateral 15.56m
   - Relative velocity: longitudinal -5.14m/s (approaching), lateral -2.87m/s (approaching)
   - Motion: Approaching from diagonal front-left
   - TTC (longitudinal): 4.84/5.14 = 0.94s (High Risk)
   - TTC (lateral): 15.56/2.87 = 5.42s (No Risk)
   - MDC: Lateral distance large but closing → Medium Risk
   - Overall Risk: 2 (High)

4. Obstacle 30201 (Front):
   - Adjusted distances: longitudinal 13.85m, lateral 0.00m
   - Relative velocity: longitudinal -0.59m/s (approaching), lateral -0.79m/s
   - Motion: Same lane, slowly approaching
   - TTC (longitudinal): 13.85/0.59 = 23.47s (No Risk)
   - MDC: Lateral alignment but slow approach → Low Risk
   - Overall Risk: 4 (Low)

5. Obstacle 30202 (Behind):
   - Adjusted distances: longitudinal -13.35m, lateral 0.00m
   - Relative velocity: longitudinal 2.58m/s (approaching), lateral -0.01m/s
   - Motion: Same lane, approaching from rear
   - TTC (longitudinal): 13.35/2.58 = 5.17s (No Risk)
   - MDC: Lateral alignment but slow approach → Low Risk
   - Overall Risk: 4 (Low)

JSON Summary:
{
    "CollisionObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": null,
        "OverallRiskScore": null
    },
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {

    }
}

Key Findings:
- No collisions or extreme risks detected
- Two high-risk obstacles (30198 and 30199) approaching from front-left
- Other obstacles present minimal risk
- Highest immediate concern is Obstacle 30198 with 1.07s TTC longitudinally at 5.72m distance
