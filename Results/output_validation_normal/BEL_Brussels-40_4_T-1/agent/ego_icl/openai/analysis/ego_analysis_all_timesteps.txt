Given the provided context, let's analyze each obstacle at the most recent timestep (`0.9 seconds`) to determine the risk of collision with the ego vehicle.

### Obstacle-by-Obstacle Risk Analysis:

**Obstacle 30194:**
- **Position/Trajectory:** Located Front-left, moving laterally away (11.97 m) while closing the longitudinal gap rapidly.
- **Adjusted Distances:** Longitudinal ≈ 21.92 m, Lateral ≈ 11.97 m.
- **Relative Velocities:** Longitudinal = -6.27 m/s, Lateral = 7.77 m/s.
- **Motion Description:** Driving toward longitudinally but moving away laterally.
- **TTC Calculation:**
  - **Longitudinal TTC:** 21.92 / 6.27 ≈ 3.50 seconds.
  - **Lateral is increasing, indicating movement away.**
- **MDC Analysis:** With increasing lateral distance, the obstacle is moving away, so no immediate collision risk.
- **Risk Assessment:** Low Risk (4), primarily due to longitudinal approach and increasing lateral distance.

**Obstacle 30198:**
- **Position/Trajectory:** Located Front-left, consistently closing longitudinal distance.
- **Adjusted Distances:** Longitudinal ≈ 5.72 m, Lateral ≈ 4.37 m.
- **Relative Velocities:** Longitudinal = -5.34 m/s (closing), Lateral = -0.00 m/s (no lateral motion).
- **Motion Description:** No lateral relative motion; moving toward the ego car longitudinally.
- **TTC Calculation:**
  - **Longitudinal TTC:** 5.72 / 5.34 ≈ 1.07 seconds.
  - **No relevant lateral component for TTC due to no motion.**
- **MDC:** Approaching rapidly with decreasing distance, hence close to collision.
- **Risk Assessment:** High Risk (2), primarily due to rapid longitudinal approach. 

**Obstacle 30199:**
- **Position/Trajectory:** Located Front-left, diagonally closing in from both directions.
- **Adjusted Distances:** Longitudinal ≈ 4.84 m, Lateral ≈ 15.56 m.
- **Relative Velocities:** Longitudinal = -5.14 m/s, Lateral = -2.87 m/s.
- **Motion Description:** Towards the ego both longitudinally and laterally.
- **TTC Calculation:**
  - **Longitudinal TTC:** 4.84 / 5.14 ≈ 0.94 seconds.
  - **Lateral approach not as significant but still converging.**
- **MDC:** Close toward ego due to both components diminishing.
- **Risk Assessment:** High Risk (2).

**Obstacle 30201:**
- **Position/Trajectory:** Directly in front, longitudinally aligned, but lateral position at 0 with longitudinal closure.
- **Adjusted Distances:** Longitudinal ≈ 13.85 m, Lateral = 0.00 m (aligned).
- **Relative Velocities:** Longitudinal = -0.59 m/s, Lateral = -0.79 m/s.
- **Motion Description:** Longitudinal approach with no significant lateral risk currently.
- **TTC Calculation:**
  - **Longitudinal TTC:** 13.85 / 0.59 ≈ 23.47 seconds (slow approach).
- **MDC:** Large, given the slow approach and significant current distance.
- **Risk Assessment:** Negligible Risk (5).

**Obstacle 30202:**
- **Position/Trajectory:** Behind and aligned longitudinally, but gaining.
- **Adjusted Distances:** Longitudinal ≈ -13.35 m (behind), Lateral = 0.00 m (aligned).
- **Relative Velocities:** Longitudinal = 2.58 m/s, Lateral = -0.01 m/s.
- **Motion Description:** Approaching from rear, consistent alignment.
- **TTC Calculation:**
  - **Longitudinal TTC:** Negative distances for rear pursuit are less concerning, given distance.
- **MDC:** Increasing rear distance gives low temporal and spatial collision risk.
- **Risk Assessment:** Low Risk (4).

### JSON Risk Summary:
```json
{
    "CollisionObstacle": null,
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null,
    "HighRiskObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "30198",
        "OverallRiskScore": "2"
    }
}
```

This JSON output signifies that Obstacle 30198 presents the highest level of concern with a high risk of collision due to its imminent path toward the ego vehicle with the longitudinal dimensions closing rapidly.
