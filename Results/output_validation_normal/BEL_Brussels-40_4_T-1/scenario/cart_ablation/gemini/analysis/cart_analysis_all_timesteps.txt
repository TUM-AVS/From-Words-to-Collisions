At t=0.9s, Ego is in lanelet 725.0 at (-152.5275, -69.3814) with a velocity of 5.3377 and decelerating.

Obstacle 30202 is also in lanelet 725.0 at (-140.9296, -82.9568), traveling at 7.9189 and decelerating. While both are in the same lanelet, the y-coordinates suggest they are not on a direct collision course.  However, given the relatively close x-coordinates and that obstacle 30202 is significantly faster than the ego vehicle, although decelerating, there's a high risk of collision if the ego vehicle maintains its course and speed. This obstacle warrants further examination, but with the information available, it does not reach the "Extreme Risk" threshold.

Other obstacles are in different lanelets and do not present an immediate collision risk.

    "IsCollisionScenario": false,
    "Reasoning": "No obstacle presents an immediate, unavoidable collision risk at t=0.9s. Obstacle 30202 poses a potential risk due to proximity and higher speed in the same lanelet, but more information is needed to determine if an evasive maneuver is required."
