At t=0.9s, Ego is in lanelet 725.0 at (-152.5275, -69.3814) with a velocity of 5.3377 and decelerating.

Obstacle 30202 is also in lanelet 725.0 at (-140.9296, -82.9568) with a velocity of 7.9189 and decelerating. While both are in the same lanelet, the y-coordinates suggest they are significantly separated laterally.  Given the deceleration rates and lateral separation, a collision in the next immediate timestep is unlikely, though continued monitoring is needed. It's a Medium Risk (3).

Obstacle 30194 is in lanelet 441 at (-180.0248, -58.1149), moving with velocity 7.8296.  It's not clear from the provided data how lanelet 441 relates spatially to lanelet 725. Without further map information, it's difficult to assess the actual risk. Conservatively, I assign a Medium Risk (3) due to lack of information about the lanelets' relationship.

Obstacle 30201 is in lanelet 830 at (-163.4567, -54.5771). Similar to the previous case, more context on the lanelet's location relative to the ego vehicle is needed.  Assigning a Medium Risk (3) based on the available data.

Obstacle 30199 is in lanelet 509 at (-171.6536, -73.4281).  Insufficient information to conclusively determine the risk level without lanelet position details.  Medium Risk (3).

Obstacle 30198 is static and poses no immediate threat.

        "Reasoning": "No obstacle presents an immediate collision risk at t=0.9s.  Obstacle 30202 is in the same lanelet as the Ego vehicle but with lateral separation and both vehicles decelerating, making immediate collision unlikely. Other obstacles' risk levels are difficult to accurately determine due to insufficient information on lanelet locations relative to the ego vehicle."
