   - **Overall Risk score**: 5

5. **Obstacle ID: 30202.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: In same lanelet (725.0) as ego, but behind ego and decelerating.
   - **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: Velocity (7.9189) is higher than ego's, but decelerating (-3.0941). Safe distance maintained.
   - **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 4

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. Ego is in lanelet 725.0, decelerating.
2. Obstacle 30202.0 is in the same lanelet but behind ego and decelerating faster.
3. All other obstacles are in different lanelets or moving away.
4. No immediate collision risk detected.
5. Safe distances and trajectories maintained for all obstacles.
