### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep:

#### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 30191**
  - **Distance Risk Reason**: The obstacle is moving away from the ego vehicle. Over recent timesteps, it maintained distance, with deviations in speed, but still moving away.
  - **Distance Safety Score**: 5

  - **Time Safety Score**: 5
  - **Overall Risk Score**: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 30192**
  - **Distance Risk Reason**: Positioned significantly away; the trajectory does not intersect with the ego vehicle.
  - **Distance Safety Score**: 5
  - **Time Risk Reason**: Fairly steady speed with minimal acceleration indicates stability in its path.
  - **Time Safety Score**: 5
  - **Overall Risk Score**: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 30194**
  - **Distance Risk Reason**: Maintains a moderate distance trajectory parallel to Ego, no direct interception.
  - **Distance Safety Score**: 4
  - **Time Risk Reason**: Relative velocity slight decreases of speed shows a potential exit from parallel trajectory in future.
  - **Time Safety Score**: 4
  - **Overall Risk Score**: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 30195**
  - **Distance Risk Reason**: Positioned farther away from Vego in a lanelet which does not directly influence the ego path immediately.
  - **Distance Safety Score**: 5
  - **Time Risk Reason**: Demonstrates stable velocity and minimal acceleration changes, indicating stable path.
  - **Time Safety Score**: 5
  - **Overall Risk Score**: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 30197**
  - **Distance Risk Reason**: In the same lanelet but maintains consistent distance; orientation aligned with Ego Vehicle.
  - **Distance Safety Score**: 4
  - **Time Risk Reason**: Steady velocity with indistinct negative acceleration, potentially reaching closer proximity.
  - **Time Safety Score**: 4
  - **Overall Risk Score**: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 30198**
  - **Distance Risk Reason**: Stationary (zero velocity and acceleration) consistent over timesteps, no impact threat.
  - **Distance Safety Score**: 5
  - **Time Risk Reason**: No movement history correlates positively for no collision threat.
  - **Time Safety Score**: 5
  - **Overall Risk Score**: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 30199**
  - **Distance Risk Reason**: Positioned in another lanelet aligning with Ego but not presenting a direct collision path.
  - **Distance Safety Score**: 5
  - **Time Risk Reason**: Slowing down, creating buffer relative to the ego vehicle.
  - **Time Safety Score**: 5
  - **Overall Risk Score**: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 30200**
  - **Distance Risk Reason**: Reserved a fair amount of distance with directionality not aiming towards Ego.
  - **Distance Safety Score**: 5
  - **Time Risk Reason**: Constant speed with minimal variances appraises no temporal threat.
  - **Time Safety Score**: 5
  - **Overall Risk Score**: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 30201**
  - **Distance Risk Reason**: Fairly constant distance observed over the time, with the lane changes that don't bring regression close to Ego.
  - **Distance Safety Score**: 5
  - **Time Risk Reason**: Temporally decreasing velocity, altering acceleration, trajectories outside Ego path.
  - **Time Safety Score**: 5
  - **Overall Risk Score**: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 30202**
  - **Distance Risk Reason**: In the proximity yet maintaining significant inertia difference with Ego preventing collision.
  - **Distance Safety Score**: 4
  - **Time Risk Reason**: Deceleration without direct intersection warns.
  - **Time Safety Score**: 4
  - **Overall Risk Score**: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 30203**
  - **Distance Risk Reason**: Remaining distance stable thus no direct collision trajectory with Ego.
  - **Distance Safety Score**: 5
  - **Time Risk Reason**: Movement seen congruently analogue stabilizing the same path non-hazardously.
  - **Time Safety Score**: 5
  - **Overall Risk Score**: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 30204**
  - **Distance Risk Reason**: Despite being on same lanelet, consistent deceleration over distance.
  - **Distance Safety Score**: 4
  - **Time Risk Reason**: Reduces velocity to potential halt obviating urgency.
  - **Time Safety Score**: 4
  - **Overall Risk Score**: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 30205**
  - **Distance Risk Reason**: While crossing same lane, inherent sufficient safe separation thus avoiding collision.
  - **Distance Safety Score**: 4
  - **Time Risk Reason**: Linearly moving away slightly on a defined path sans interceptor.
  - **Time Safety Score**: 4
  - **Overall Risk Score**: 4

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
From the complete analysis, all obstacles maintain safe distances or align with parallel velocities, assuring non-interceptive trajectories with the ego vehicle; hence, no evidently marked collision scenario encountered.
