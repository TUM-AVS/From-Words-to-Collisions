Obstacle 30198 is approaching the ego vehicle longitudinally at -5.34 m/s and laterally at 0.00 m/s with a longitudinal distance of 5.72 meters and a small lateral distance of 4.37 meters.  This represents a very high risk of collision in the near future.

Obstacle 30199 is also approaching longitudinally at -5.14 m/s and laterally at -2.87 m/s, with a longitudinal distance of only 4.84 meters and a lateral distance of 15.56 meters. While the lateral distance is larger than that of Obstacle 30198, the smaller longitudinal distance and continuous approach raise significant concern. It poses a high risk, though not as immediate as 30198.

Obstacle 30201 is at a safer longitudinal distance of 13.85 meters but is still approaching at -0.59 m/s longitudinally and -0.79 m/s laterally. Given the current distances and velocities, this obstacle doesn't present an immediate threat but bears monitoring.

Obstacle 30202, located behind the ego vehicle, is moving away longitudinally and does not pose a collision risk in the immediate future.

Obstacle 30194, while approaching longitudinally, is moving away laterally and has a significantly larger longitudinal distance, presenting no immediate concern.

  "ScenarioAnalysis": {
    "IsCollisionScenario": false,
    "Reasoning": "Obstacle 30198 poses an extreme risk with a high probability of collision in the next few timesteps due to its proximity and velocity relative to the ego vehicle. While not an immediate collision, the risk is extremely high and requires immediate action. Other obstacles are not currently on a direct collision path but should be monitored."
