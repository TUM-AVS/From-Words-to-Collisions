Obstacle 30199 is approaching the ego vehicle longitudinally at -5.14 m/s and laterally at -2.87 m/s. It is the closest obstacle to the ego vehicle, with a longitudinal distance of 4.84 m and a lateral distance of 15.56 m. This obstacle poses a high risk, although not extreme or collision-imminent at this specific timestep, because its trajectory indicates it could get significantly closer to the ego car very soon.

Obstacle 30198 is also approaching longitudinally at -5.34 m/s with no lateral movement relative to the ego vehicle. While it is further away laterally (4.37m) than Obstacle 30199, its longitudinal distance of 5.72m suggests a potential risk if the ego vehicle were to make a sudden leftward maneuver.

Obstacle 30194 is approaching the ego vehicle longitudinally but moving away laterally. Its greater distances (21.92m longitudinal and 11.97m lateral) suggest it is not an immediate threat.

Obstacle 30201 and 30202 are relatively far and do not present an immediate risk.

Based on the provided context, there is no collision or extreme risk obstacle at the most recent timestep. While Obstacle 30199 and 30198 pose a high risk, they do not meet the criteria for an extreme risk at the current moment. The scenario is not a collision scenario as there are no unavoidable collisions in the next timestep.

        "Reasoning": "No obstacle is predicted to collide with the ego vehicle in the next timestep. Although Obstacles 30199 and 30198 present a high risk due to their proximity and closing speed, they do not pose an extreme or collision level threat at the current timestep."
