### Safety analysis for timestep 0.9 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

**Assumptions and Clarifications:**

* The prompt mentions "adjusted distances" (adjusted_d_long and adjusted_d_lat), but these values are not provided in the scenario context.  Therefore, the analysis below will use the given `real distance` (longitudinal and lateral) as a proxy for these missing adjusted distances.  This might lead to slightly less accurate risk assessments.
* TTC calculations assume constant relative velocity and acceleration.  In real-world scenarios, these values change continuously, impacting the accuracy of TTC predictions.  A more sophisticated approach would involve integrating the relative motion over time. 
* Lateral movement is also critical. Even if an obstacle is far away longitudinally, a high lateral speed towards the ego vehicle can pose a substantial risk.
* I infer "driving toward the ego car" means the relative longitudinal velocity is negative. 

**Calculations and Analysis per Obstacle:**

* **Obstacle ID: 30194**
    - Distance Risk reason:  Large longitudinal (21.92m) and lateral (21.92m) distances, and moving away laterally.
    - Distance safety score: 5
    - Time Risk reason: While approaching longitudinally, the lateral movement is away from the ego vehicle, significantly reducing the risk. TTC calculations are not meaningful in this case due to the diverging lateral motion.
    - Time safety score: 4
    - Overall Risk score: 4

* **Obstacle ID: 30198**
    - Distance Risk reason:  Longitudinal and lateral distances are both 5.72m, which is quite close.
    - Distance safety score: 2
    - Time Risk reason: Approaching longitudinally at -5.34 m/s, implying a short TTC.  No lateral motion simplifies the calculation, but increases the risk in this case. TTC = 5.72 m / 5.34 m/s ≈ 1.1 seconds.
    - Time safety score: 2
    - Overall Risk score: 2

* **Obstacle ID: 30199**
    - Distance Risk reason: Both longitudinal and lateral distances are only 4.84m, indicating a high proximity and risk.
    - Distance safety score: 1
    - Time Risk reason: Approaching longitudinally at -5.14 m/s and laterally at -2.87 m/s. Both motions increase the risk of collision.  TTC longitudinally is approximately 4.84m / 5.14 m/s ≈ 0.94 seconds.
    - Time safety score: 1
    - Overall Risk score: 1

* **Obstacle ID: 30201**
    - Distance Risk reason:  Relatively far with 13.85m longitudinal and lateral distance.
    - Distance safety score: 4
    - Time Risk reason:  Slow longitudinal approach speed (-0.59 m/s) and slight lateral motion (-0.79m/s),  resulting in a large TTC. 
    - Time safety score: 4
    - Overall Risk score: 4

* **Obstacle ID: 30202**
    - Distance Risk reason:  At -13.35m, it's a safe distance behind the ego vehicle.
    - Distance safety score: 4
    - Time Risk reason: While the obstacle is moving towards the ego car from behind (2.58 m/s), the distance and relative motion do not suggest an imminent collision.
    - Time safety score: 4
    - Overall Risk score: 4

```json
{
    "CollisionObstacle": null,
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "30199",
        "OverallRiskScore": "1"
    },
    "IsCollisionScenario": false,
    "Justification": "Obstacle 30199 poses an extreme risk (score 1) due to its close proximity and velocity towards the ego vehicle, indicating a high probability of collision if no action is taken.  No immediate collisions are predicted, although Obstacle 30199 requires immediate attention."
