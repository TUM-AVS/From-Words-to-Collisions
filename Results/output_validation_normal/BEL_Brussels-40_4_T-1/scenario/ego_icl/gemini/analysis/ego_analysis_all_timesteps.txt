* **Obstacle 30194:**

    * **Trajectory:** This obstacle appears at t=0.8s. It is approaching the ego vehicle longitudinally while moving away laterally.
    * **TTC (Longitudinal):** 21.92m / 6.27m/s ≈ 3.5s
    * **TTC (Lateral):** Not applicable as it's moving away laterally.
    * **MDC:**  Not easily calculable with the given information, but given the lateral movement away from the ego vehicle and the front-left position, the risk of collision seems low. We will tentatively estimate MDC > 5m.
    * **Risk:** Medium Risk (3) due to the longitudinal TTC.

* **Obstacle 30198:**

    * **Trajectory:**  Consistently approaching longitudinally, initially also approaching laterally, but lateral velocity becomes negligible in later timesteps.
    * **TTC (Longitudinal):** 5.72m / 5.34m/s ≈ 1.1s
    * **TTC (Lateral):**  Not applicable as lateral relative velocity is essentially zero.
    * **MDC:** Given the lateral distance of 4.37m and almost zero lateral velocity, MDC is likely around this value.
    * **Risk:** High Risk (2) due to longitudinal TTC.

* **Obstacle 30199:**

    * **Trajectory:** Consistently approaching both longitudinally and laterally.
    * **TTC (Longitudinal):** 4.84m / 5.14m/s ≈ 0.9s
    * **TTC (Lateral):** 15.56m / 2.87m/s ≈ 5.4s
    * **MDC:** Given the converging trajectory, we need to consider the combined longitudinal and lateral movement.  The smaller distance between the two is approaching faster and represents the real concern. It is difficult to calculate the exact MDC without knowing the exact trajectories, but with a longitudinal distance below 5 meters and decreasing, the risk is significant. A conservative estimate is MDC < 5m.
    * **Risk:** High Risk (2) due to the combination of longitudinal TTC and converging trajectory.


* **Obstacle 30201:**

    * **Trajectory:** Consistently approaching longitudinally, lateral distance is consistently zero, indicating perfect alignment in the same lane.
    * **TTC (Longitudinal):** 13.85m / 0.59m/s ≈ 23.5s
    * **TTC (Lateral):** Not applicable due to zero lateral distance and changing lateral velocity. The "Exact lateral alignment or unknown case" suggests that the obstacle might be changing lanes or performing a maneuver, which explains the fluctuating lateral velocities despite the zero lateral distances.
    * **MDC:** With exact longitudinal alignment and slow closing velocity, MDC is hard to estimate accurately but is not immediately concerning.  We will estimate MDC > 5m.
    * **Risk:** Low Risk (4) despite the lateral alignment because the relative longitudinal velocity is quite low.

* **Obstacle 30202:**

    * **Trajectory:**  Approaching from behind, maintaining exact lateral alignment.
    * **TTC (Longitudinal):** -13.35m / 2.58 m/s (negative indicates the obstacle is behind).  TTC is not meaningful in this case.
    * **TTC (Lateral):** Not applicable due to zero lateral distance.
    * **MDC:**  With exact lateral alignment, the risk depends entirely on the longitudinal closing velocity. Although the obstacle is closing in, it is still relatively far behind. We estimate MDC > 5m.
    * **Risk:**  Low Risk (4) as the obstacle is approaching from behind but still relatively far, and at a moderate relative velocity.

**Conclusion:**

This is NOT a collision scenario. While some obstacles are approaching, none have an immediate risk of collision.  Obstacles 30198 and 30199 present the highest risk but are still classified as High Risk (2), not Extreme Risk (1).

**JSON Summary:**

  "Justification": "No obstacle has a risk score of 0 (collision) or 1 (extreme risk). The highest risk is 2 (high risk) for obstacles 30198 and 30199, but their TTC values are above the 0.5s threshold for extreme risk."
