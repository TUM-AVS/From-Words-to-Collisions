To analyze the collision risk in the given scenario, we shall focus on the most recent timestep (0.9 seconds) and understand the trajectory from the preceding data points. Here's the obstacle-by-obstacle analysis:

### Obstacle-by-Obstacle Analysis

#### Obstacle 30194
- **Trajectory Analysis**: This obstacle is moving away laterally to the left, as indicated by an increasing lateral distance and negative velocity longitudinally.
- **Adjusted Distances**: Longitudinal 21.92 m, Lateral 11.97 m
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal -6.27 m/s (moving away), Lateral 7.77 m/s (increasing lateral distance)
- **TTC Calculation**: N/A since it's moving laterally away
- **MDC**: Considering the lateral movement is away, longitudinal is significant; MDC > 5 m.
- **Risk Score**: 5 (No Risk)

#### Obstacle 30198
- **Trajectory Analysis**: This obstacle is consistently closing in longitudinally with no lateral relative motion.
- **Adjusted Distances**: Longitudinal 5.72 m, Lateral 4.37 m
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal -5.34 m/s (approaching), Lateral 0.00 m/s
- **TTC Calculation**: Longitudinal: 5.72 / 5.34 ≈ 1.07 seconds
- **MDC**: Around 5 m based on decreasing distance longitudinally
- **Risk Score**: 3 (Medium Risk): The obstacle is approaching, but the time to collision and paths suggest intermediate action needed.

#### Obstacle 30199
- **Trajectory Analysis**: This obstacle's projection involves converging lateral and longitudinal paths.
- **Adjusted Distances**: Longitudinal 4.84 m, Lateral 15.56 m
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal -5.14 m/s, Lateral -2.87 m/s (approaching in both)
- **TTC Calculation**:
  - Longitudinal: 4.84 / 5.14 ≈ 0.94 seconds
  - Lateral: 15.56 / 2.87 ≈ 5.42 seconds
- **MDC**: Less than 1 meter along converging paths, suggesting proximity over time
- **Risk Score**: 2 (High Risk): Due to low MDC and the time to collision for longitudinally nearing high-risk thresholds.

#### Obstacle 30201
- **Trajectory Analysis**: Exact alignment longitudinal with small closing velocity.
- **Adjusted Distances**: Longitudinal 13.85 m, Lateral 0.00 m
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal -0.59 m/s (marginally approaching), Lateral -0.79 m/s
- **TTC Calculation**: Longitudinal: 13.85 / 0.59 ≈ 23.47 seconds
- **MDC**: Maintained alignment suggests no lateral distance concern.
- **Risk Score**: 4 (Low Risk): Long-term low-risk due to long TTC and stable path alignment.

#### Obstacle 30202
- **Trajectory Analysis**: Moving from behind with an increasing longitudinal convergence.
- **Adjusted Distances**: Longitudinal -13.35 m, Lateral 0.00 m
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal 2.58 m/s (chasing from behind)
- **TTC Calculation**: Longitudinal: Not immediate as the obstacle is behind and increasing distanced
- **MDC**: Greater than 5m since obstacle is still far behind
- **Risk Score**: 5 (No Risk): Trajectories do not intersect; further observation needed.

### Conclusion:
While Obstacle 30199 poses a significant high risk with low MDC and near TTC thresholds, there are no signs of a direct collision (risk score 0) or extreme risk (risk score 1). Thus, the scenario does not indicate an immediate collision risk.

All obstacles are currently being managed with medium to low risk monitoring, and proactive caution continues to prevent escalation.
