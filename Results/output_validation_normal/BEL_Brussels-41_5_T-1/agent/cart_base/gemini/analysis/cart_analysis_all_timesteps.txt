The ego vehicle is in lanelet 251. Several obstacles are present, most notably in lanelet 249.  Let's analyze the closest obstacles:

* **Obstacles in Lanelet 249 (30171, 30172, 30173):** These obstacles are in the adjacent lanelet to the ego vehicle. While their lateral distances aren't provided, their longitudinal positions are relatively close to the ego vehicle.  Obstacle 30172 is stationary, which simplifies its prediction. Obstacles 30171 and 30173 are moving, but their velocities are decreasing, suggesting they might be slowing down or stopping.  Without lateral distance, it's difficult to definitively categorize the risk, but they pose a potential risk if the ego vehicle were to drift or change lanes.

* **Obstacle in Lanelet 1413/253 (30168):**  This obstacle starts in lanelet 1413 and then transitions to 253.  It maintains a relatively constant velocity until t=0.4 where its velocity drops and acceleration become highly negative indicating it is hard braking. This obstacle appears further away and is probably less of an immediate concern than those in lanelet 249. While its lanelet changes, it doesn't immediately suggest an imminent collision risk with the ego vehicle.

* **Obstacle in Lanelet 253 (30170):** This obstacle appears at t=0.2 and maintains a rather consistent velocity.  Like obstacle 30168, its lanelet being different from the ego vehicle's suggests a lower risk.

Based on the provided information, there are no immediate collisions. The obstacles in lanelet 249 pose the highest potential risk due to proximity, but without lateral distance, it's hard to quantify that risk.  A conservative approach would be to classify them as a medium risk due to their proximity and the ego vehicle's braking behavior.
