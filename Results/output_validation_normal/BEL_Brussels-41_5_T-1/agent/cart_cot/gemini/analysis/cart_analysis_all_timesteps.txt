Here's the collision risk assessment for the provided scenario at t=0.9s:

**Ego Vehicle State at t=0.9s:**
* Position: (-193.2088, 412.4143)
* Velocity: 6.727 
* Acceleration: 0.0679
* Lanelet: 251.0

**Obstacles Analysis at t=0.9s:**

* **Obstacle 30168.0:**
    * Position: (-196.1602, 397.4756)
    * Velocity: 5.3534
    * Acceleration: -0.8537
    * Lanelet: 253.0
    * Analysis: This obstacle is in a different lanelet (253.0) than the ego vehicle (251.0).  While the Y-coordinate difference is significant, the x coordinates suggest potential for future conflict if the ego vehicle were to change lanes or if this obstacle's trajectory veers significantly.  There is no immediate danger, and there is ample time and distance for the ego vehicle to react or adjust if needed.
    * Risk Assessment:
        * Position: 4
        * Velocity: 4
        * Overall Risk Score: 4 (Low Risk)


* **Obstacle 30170.0:**
    * Position: (-197.2814, 383.5916)
    * Velocity: 5.5497
    * Acceleration: 0.2332
    * Lanelet: 253.0
    * Analysis: Similar to Obstacle 30168.0, this obstacle is also in lanelet 253.0, presenting no immediate risk. The larger difference in the Y-coordinate compared to Obstacle 30168.0 indicates a lower risk.
    * Risk Assessment:
        * Position: 5
        * Velocity: 5
        * Overall Risk Score: 5 (Negligible Risk)


* **Obstacle 30171.0:**
    * Position: (-210.0555, 409.3218)
    * Velocity: 1.0147
    * Acceleration: -1.1362
    * Lanelet: 249.0
    * Analysis: Located in lanelet 249.0 and further along the x-axis, this obstacle poses no immediate threat. While the y-coordinate difference is smaller than that of Obstacles 30168 and 30170, different lanelets suggest they are moving in different directions and likely to separate further with time.
    * Risk Assessment:
        * Position: 4
        * Velocity: 4
        * Overall Risk Score: 4 (Low Risk)


* **Obstacle 30172.0:**
    * Position: (-202.7064, 404.9298)
    * Velocity: 0.0
    * Acceleration: 0.0
    * Lanelet: 249.0
    * Analysis: This stationary obstacle in lanelet 249.0 is not an immediate concern at the current timestep.  However, depending on the ego vehicle's intended lane changes and future maneuvers, this obstacle might become a concern in the near future. Currently, the combination of distance, lane separation, and zero velocity mitigates immediate risk.
    * Risk Assessment:
        * Position: 4
        * Velocity: 5
        * Overall Risk Score: 4 (Low Risk)


* **Obstacle 30173.0:**
    * Position: (-217.9506, 414.8349)
    * Velocity: 1.9549
    * Acceleration: -0.6339
    * Lanelet: 249.0
    * Analysis: Though this obstacle is in a different lanelet (249.0), the y-coordinate places this obstacle close to the ego vehicle's current path, indicating a potential collision risk. This is compounded by its proximity to the Ego vehicle along the x-axis. Close monitoring is recommended due to the relatively small difference in Y-coordinates.
    * Risk Assessment:
        * Position: 3
        * Velocity: 4
        * Overall Risk Score: 3 (Medium Risk)
