At t=0.9s, the ego vehicle at (-193.21, 412.41) maintains a velocity of 6.73 m/s and an orientation of -1.89 radians.  Let's analyze the risk posed by each obstacle:

* **Obstacle 30168:** Located at (-196.16, 397.48), this obstacle is behind and to the left of the ego vehicle, in a different lanelet (253). Its velocity is 5.35 m/s. Given the lateral separation and differing lanelet, the risk is negligible.

* **Obstacle 30170:** Located at (-197.28, 383.59), this obstacle is significantly behind the ego vehicle and in a different lanelet (253).  It poses no immediate risk.

* **Obstacle 30171:** Positioned at (-210.06, 409.32), this obstacle is ahead and to the left of the ego, in lanelet 249. Although it is in a different lanelet, its proximity warrants attention.  Further analysis considering future time steps is needed to determine the level of risk, but currently assessed as medium.

* **Obstacle 30172:**  This stationary obstacle at (-202.71, 404.93) is ahead and to the left of the ego vehicle, in lanelet 249.  While stationary, it's important to consider the ego vehicle's trajectory and ensure sufficient clearance. It requires continued monitoring and is classified as medium risk due to proximity.

* **Obstacle 30173:** At (-217.95, 414.83), this obstacle is further ahead and slightly to the left of the ego, also in lanelet 249.  Its velocity is 1.95 m/s. Given the longitudinal and lateral separation, the risk is low.
