To evaluate potential collision risks, it is important to analyze the positions, velocities, and trajectories of the Ego and the surrounding obstacles. We will focus on the most recent time step, 0.9 seconds, and reference previous data for trends.

### Detailed Analysis:

1. **Obstacle 30168.0:**
   - Positioned at (-196.1602, 397.4756) and moving at 5.3534 m/s.
   - The trajectory is taking it further from the Ego vehicle, and it is located in a separate lanelet (253 compared to 251 for Ego) indicating no immediate collision course. 
   - **Risk Assessment**: Low risk since it's diverging and not on the same path.

2. **Obstacle 30170.0:**
   - Positioned at (-197.2814, 383.5916) with a velocity of 5.5497 m/s.
   - Positioned far from Ego's lanelet and continuing on a separate lanelet (253).
   - **Risk Assessment**: Minimal risk due to separate lanelets and significant distance.

3. **Obstacle 30171.0:**
   - Located at (-210.0555, 409.3218) with low velocity (1.0147 m/s) and significant distance.
   - Although it's on the same lanelet (249) as some static obstacles, it is not in proximity to the Ego.
   - **Risk Assessment**: Low risk due to low speed and maintaining distance.

4. **Obstacle 30172.0:**
   - Static obstacle at position (-202.7064, 404.9298).
   - Given its static nature and position far from the Ego's lanelet, it poses no immediate threat.
   - **Risk Assessment**: Negligible risk.

5. **Obstacle 30173.0:**
   - Position at (-217.9506, 414.8349), moving at 1.9549 m/s.
   - Although within lanelet 249, it is moving away from the Ego vehicle's path.
   - **Risk Assessment**: Low risk as it diverges.

6. **Ego Vehicle:**
   - At position (-193.2088, 412.4143) with a velocity of 6.727 m/s.
   - Continues in its lanelet 251 without immediate risk of collision or obstacles on a converging path.

### Risk Scores: 

No immediate risks are identified with a TTC suggesting immediate collision or contact based on the current trajectory analysis. Most obstacles are in different lanelets, diverging in movement, or distant enough to not require evasive actions beyond regular observation.
