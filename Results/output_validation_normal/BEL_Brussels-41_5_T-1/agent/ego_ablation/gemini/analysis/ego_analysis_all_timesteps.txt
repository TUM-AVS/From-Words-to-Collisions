Obstacle 30173 is at high risk of collision with the ego vehicle. At the most recent timestep (0.9 seconds), it is only 1.07 meters in front of the ego vehicle and -22.62 meters to the right, laterally. Although the lateral distance suggests some separation, the primarily longitudinal closing velocity of -6.16 m/s indicates a rapidly decreasing distance between the vehicles.  Given the short time to react and current velocities, this represents an imminent collision risk.  The obstacle is moving towards the ego vehicle both longitudinally and laterally.

Obstacle 30171 is also a concern.  At the latest timestep, it's 3.79m in front and -13.38m to the right, laterally.  The closing longitudinal velocity of -6.47 m/s suggests this obstacle needs to be monitored as it does present a collision risk in the near future.

Obstacle 30172 is less of a concern despite being longitudinally closer to the ego vehicle at 5.61 meters than Obstacle 30171.  The lateral distance of -5.01 meters to the right and continued lateral motion indicates this obstacle will not collide in the near future.  The longitudinal closing velocity of -6.73 m/s suggests this needs to be monitored.
