Obstacle 30173 is at an extremely high risk of collision with the ego vehicle.  At the most recent timestep (0.9 seconds), its longitudinal distance is only 1.07 meters and closing at -6.16 m/s. While the lateral distance is significant (-22.62 m) and it's moving laterally towards the ego vehicle at 1.87 m/s, the primary concern is the imminent longitudinal collision. It's highly likely a collision will occur within the next fraction of a second if no evasive action is taken.

Obstacle 30171 also presents a high risk. At 0.9 seconds, it's only 3.79 meters away longitudinally, approaching at -6.47 m/s.  Its lateral motion and distance (-13.38 m and 0.98 m/s respectively) suggest it is likely to pass in front of the ego vehicle, but the close longitudinal proximity necessitates immediate action to avoid a collision.
