### Safety analysis for timestep 0.9 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

**Assumptions and Clarifications:**

* Since adjusted distances (adjusted_d_long, adjusted_d_lat) are not provided in the scenario context, raw DTClong and DTClat values will be used for the analysis.  This will impact the accuracy of the risk assessment.  Providing adjusted distances is crucial for a realistic evaluation.
* TTC will be approximated based on the provided distance and velocity data.  Ideally, more sophisticated TTC calculations accounting for acceleration would be beneficial.
* A simple risk assessment logic will be used based on distance and TTC thresholds.  This can be customized based on specific requirements.


**Risk Assessment Logic:**

* **Distance:**
    * < 2m: Score 0 (Collision)
    * 2m - 4m: Score 1 (Extreme Risk)
    * 4m - 6m: Score 2 (High Risk)
    * 6m - 8m: Score 3 (Medium Risk)
    * 8m - 10m: Score 4 (Low Risk)
    * > 10m: Score 5 (Negligible Risk)
* **TTC:**
    * < 1s: Score 0 (Collision)
    * 1s - 2s: Score 1 (Extreme Risk)
    * 2s - 3s: Score 2 (High Risk)
    * 3s - 4s: Score 3 (Medium Risk)
    * 4s - 5s: Score 4 (Low Risk)
    * > 5s: Score 5 (Negligible Risk)
* **Overall Risk Score:** Minimum of Distance and Time Risk Scores
