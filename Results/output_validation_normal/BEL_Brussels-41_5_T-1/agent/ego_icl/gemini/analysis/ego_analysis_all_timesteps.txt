Obstacle 30168: Located front-left, longitudinal distance 10.59m, lateral distance 0.35m.  The trajectory shows the obstacle moving slightly closer longitudinally while moving away laterally from the ego vehicle.  Given the lateral movement, a collision is unlikely. TTC longitudinal is 10.59m / 1.52 m/s = 7s.  TTC lateral is not applicable because it is moving away. MDC is >5m. Risk level: 5 - Negligible Risk

Obstacle 30170: Located front-left, longitudinal distance 24.11m, lateral distance 3.70m. The trajectory shows the obstacle approaching longitudinally but moving away laterally.  TTC longitudinal is 24.11 / 1.33 m/s = 18s. TTC lateral is not applicable. MDC is >5m. Risk level: 5 - Negligible Risk.

Obstacle 30171: Located front-right, longitudinal distance 3.79m, lateral distance -13.38m. Although it appears close longitudinally, the lateral distance is quite large and the trajectories are not converging quickly enough to present an imminent collision risk. TTC longitudinal is 3.79m / 6.47 m/s = 0.59s.  TTC Lateral is not applicable. MDC is approximately 3.79m.  Risk level: 2 - High Risk (due to TTC).

Obstacle 30172: Located front-right, longitudinal distance 5.61m, lateral distance -5.01m. The obstacle is approaching longitudinally, with no lateral movement indicated. TTC Longitudinal is 5.61m / 6.73 m/s = 0.83s.  TTC Lateral is not applicable. MDC is approximately 5.61m.  Risk level: 2 - High Risk due to TTC.

Obstacle 30173: Located front-right, longitudinal distance 1.07m, lateral distance -22.62m.  While the lateral distance is large, the longitudinal distance is very small, indicating extreme risk due to proximity and converging trajectory. TTC longitudinal is 1.07m / 6.16 m/s = 0.17s. TTC lateral is not applicable. MDC is approximately 1.07m.  Risk level: 1 - Extreme Risk.
