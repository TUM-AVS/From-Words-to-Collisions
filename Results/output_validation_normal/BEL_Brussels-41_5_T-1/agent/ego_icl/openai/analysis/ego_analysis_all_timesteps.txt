Let's analyze each obstacle based on the provided data at the most recent timestep (0.9 seconds) using the adjusted distances and the given motion descriptions to determine the collision risk level.

### Obstacle-by-Obstacle Analysis

1. **Obstacle 30168**
   - **Position and Movement**: Front-left, adjusted distance longitudinal 10.59 m and lateral 0.35 m. Approaching longitudinally and moving away laterally.
   - **TTC Calculation**: Longitudinal TTC = 10.59 m / 1.52 m/s ≈ 6.97 seconds.
   - **MDC Calculation**: Since the obstacle is moving away laterally, the imminent collision risk is low.
   - **Trajectory**: Approaching longitudinally but moving away laterally. This suggests diverging paths.
   - **Risk Assessment**: With a TTC > 5.0 seconds and divergent lateral movement, this registers as Negligible Risk (5).

2. **Obstacle 30170**
   - **Position and Movement**: Front-left, adjusted distance longitudinal 24.11 m and lateral 3.70 m. Approaching longitudinally but moving slightly away laterally.
   - **TTC Calculation**: Longitudinal TTC = 24.11 m / 1.33 m/s ≈ 18.12 seconds.
   - **MDC Calculation**: Lateral distance is increasing, indicating diverging paths.
   - **Risk Assessment**: Nearest proximity calculations indicate no immediate threat; No Risk (5).

3. **Obstacle 30171**
   - **Position and Movement**: Front-right, adjusted distance longitudinal 3.79 m and lateral -13.38 m. Approaching both longitudinally and laterally.
   - **TTC Calculation**: Longitudinal TTC = 3.79 m / 6.47 m/s ≈ 0.59 seconds.
   - **MDC Calculation**: Approaching rapidly, both longitudinal and lateral trajectories are converging.
   - **Trajectory**: Closing on both fronts.
   - **Risk Assessment**: Based on a short TTC and converging paths, this poses a High Risk (2).

4. **Obstacle 30172**
   - **Position and Movement**: Front-right, adjusted distance longitudinal 5.61 m and lateral -5.01 m. Approaching longitudinally with no lateral movement.
   - **TTC Calculation**: Longitudinal TTC = 5.61 m / 6.73 m/s ≈ 0.83 seconds.
   - **MDC Calculation**: No lateral change, imminent contact possible if paths are unaltered.
   - **Risk Assessment**: Due to the proximity and short TTC, this also indicates a High Risk (2).

5. **Obstacle 30173**
   - **Position and Movement**: Front-right, adjusted distance longitudinal 1.07 m and lateral -22.62 m. Approaching both longitudinally and laterally.
   - **TTC Calculation**: Longitudinal TTC = 1.07 m / 6.16 m/s ≈ 0.17 seconds.
   - **MDC Calculation**: Both longitudinal and lateral paths are converging rapidly.
   - **Trajectory**: Critical closing situation.
   - **Risk Assessment**: With such a short TTC, this is an Extreme Risk (1).

### JSON Summary

```json
{
    "CollisionObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": null,
        "OverallRiskScore": null
    },
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "30173",
        "OverallRiskScore": "1"
    },
    "HighRiskObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "30171",
        "OverallRiskScore": "2"
    }
}
```

The JSON output highlights Obstacle 30173 as posing an Extreme Risk due to rapid approaching behavior, while Obstacle 30171 is a High Risk due to a slightly longer but still concerning TTC. The other obstacles present lower to negligible risk levels.
