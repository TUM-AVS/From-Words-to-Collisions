At t=0.9s, the ego vehicle at (-193.2088, 412.4143) in lanelet 251 is moving with a velocity of 6.727 and decelerating slightly.  Several obstacles are present, but none pose an immediate collision or extreme risk. Obstacles 30171, 30172, and 30173 are in lanelet 249, which appears to be adjacent to the ego's lanelet. Although they are relatively close, their velocities and trajectories don't suggest an imminent collision within the next few timesteps. Obstacle 30168 and 30170 are further away and in different lanelets, posing even less risk.
