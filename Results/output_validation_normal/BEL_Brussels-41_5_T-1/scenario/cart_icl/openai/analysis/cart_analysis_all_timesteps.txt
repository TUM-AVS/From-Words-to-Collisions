### Obstacle Analysis for Most Recent Timestep:

#### Obstacle ID: 30168.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is in a different lanelet (253) and is moving parallel to the ego vehicle. The distance remains significant, so no immediate threat.
- **Distance safety score**: 4
- **Time Risk reason**: The velocity and acceleration trends indicate that the obstacle's speed is relatively steady. It's not converging towards the ego vehicle.
- **Time safety score**: 4
- **Overall Risk score**: 4

#### Obstacle ID: 30169.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: Positioned far from the ego in a different lanelet (1356) with no crossing trajectories.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: Consistent velocity and no significant acceleration imply a stable trajectory away from the ego.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 30170.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: This obstacle is on the same lanelet (253) as another, farther from the ego. No immediate collision risk observed.
- **Distance safety score**: 3
- **Time Risk reason**: Exhibiting a relatively stable velocity with some randomness in acceleration, but on a non-intersecting path with the ego vehicle.
- **Time safety score**: 3
- **Overall Risk score**: 3

#### Obstacle ID: 30171.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: Despite being in a different lanelet (249), it remains considerably behind the ego vehicle.
- **Distance safety score**: 4
- **Time Risk reason**: Decreasing velocity and acceleration indicate no future intersection path with the ego vehicle.
- **Time safety score**: 4
- **Overall Risk score**: 4

#### Obstacle ID: 30172.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: Stationary and positioned in lanelet 249. Not in the path of the ego vehicle.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: With zero velocity and acceleration, there is no threat posed by this obstacle.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 30173.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: In lanelet 249, moving in a relatively parallel direction and behind the ego vehicle.
- **Distance safety score**: 4
- **Time Risk reason**: Slowing down slightly and consistently, mostly due to negative acceleration. Not heading towards the ego vehicle.
- **Time safety score**: 4
- **Overall Risk score**: 4

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
Overall, there is no collision scenario in this timestep. The obstacles either maintain distance, are on parallel paths, or are showing behavior that diverges from a collision course due to their velocity and acceleration profiles. Historical trajectory analysis confirms that none of the obstacles are on a trajectory leading to immediate collision with the ego vehicle.
