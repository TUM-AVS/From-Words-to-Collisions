Obstacle 30173 is at high risk of collision with the ego vehicle.  It is only 1.07 meters in front of the ego vehicle and closing at -6.16 m/s longitudinally. While the lateral distance is -22.62m and the lateral velocity is moving away from the ego vehicle (1.87 m/s), the longitudinal distance and velocity indicate an imminent collision.

Obstacle 30171 is also a concern. It is 3.79 meters in front of the ego vehicle and closing at a longitudinal speed of -6.47 m/s. Although it has a significant lateral distance (-13.38m), the combined longitudinal and lateral movement suggests a potential collision in the near future if no evasive action is taken.

Obstacle 30172 is less of a concern than 30173 and 30171, but still requires monitoring.  It's closing longitudinally at -6.73 m/s and is 5.61 meters in front of the ego car.  While there is no lateral movement, the closing longitudinal speed warrants attention.
