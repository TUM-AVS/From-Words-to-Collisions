### Safety analysis for timestep 0.9 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

**A critical assumption:** Since adjusted distances (adjusted_d_long, adjusted_d_lat) are not provided in the scenario context, the provided real distances (DTClong, DTClat) will be used for this analysis.  This may lead to less precise risk assessments.  **It is strongly recommended to include adjusted distances in future scenario descriptions.**

**General Notes:**  A TTC calculation of "inf" denotes that the objects are moving away from each other or are not on a collision course in that direction.



### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 30168**
- Distance Risk reason: Located 10.59m longitudinally and 10.59m laterally in the Front-left.  Relatively far away, and moving further left laterally.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason:  TTC calculations cannot be performed accurately without relative velocity and acceleration in separated longitudinal and lateral components. Given the current distance and motion description, a collision is not imminent.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 30170**
- Distance Risk reason: Located 24.11m longitudinally and 24.11m laterally in the Front-left. Very far away, and moving further left laterally.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason:  TTC calculations cannot be performed accurately without velocity and acceleration components. Given the distance and motion, no immediate time risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 30171**
- Distance Risk reason: Located 3.79m longitudinally and 3.79m laterally in the Front-right.  Very close and moving closer both longitudinally and laterally.
- Distance safety score: 2
- Time Risk reason:  TTC calculations cannot be performed accurately without velocity and acceleration components. Given the close proximity and closing motion, high risk in the immediate future.
- Time safety score: 2
- Overall Risk score: 2

- **Obstacle ID: 30172**
- Distance Risk reason: Located 5.61m longitudinally and 5.61m laterally in the Front-right. Relatively close and continuing to approach longitudinally.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: TTC calculations cannot be performed accurately. Given the distance and closing motion, moderate time risk.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3

- **Obstacle ID: 30173**
- Distance Risk reason: Located 1.07m longitudinally and 1.07m laterally in the Front-right. Extremely close to the ego vehicle.
- Distance safety score: 1
- Time Risk reason: TTC calculations cannot be performed accurately. Given the extremely close proximity and closing motion, very high risk of imminent collision.
- Time safety score: 1
- Overall Risk score: 1


### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
  "CollisionObstacle": null,
  "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {
    "ObstacleID": "30173",
    "OverallRiskScore": "1"
  },
  "IsCollisionScenario": false,
  "Justification": "Obstacle 30173 poses an extreme risk with a very close proximity (1.07m) and is on a closing trajectory, making a collision highly likely in the immediate future. While no obstacle is currently in a collision state, immediate action is required to avoid impact with 30173."
