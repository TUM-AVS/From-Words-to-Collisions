Obstacle 30217 is in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle and initially quite far behind. However, it is approaching at a significantly higher speed (around 9 m/s vs ego's 7 m/s). While the distance decreases over the provided timesteps, obstacle 30217 exhibits fluctuating acceleration, including hard braking towards the end of the provided timeframe. This behavior, combined with the higher speed and closing distance, presents a high risk, though not yet extreme or collision-level.

Other obstacles are in different lanelets and do not pose an immediate threat based on the provided positions and orientations.
