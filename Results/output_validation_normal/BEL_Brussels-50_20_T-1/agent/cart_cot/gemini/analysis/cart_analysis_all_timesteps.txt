Here's the collision risk analysis for the provided scenario at t=0.9s:

**Ego Vehicle State (t=0.9s):**
* Position: (457.0442, 313.1492)
* Orientation: 0.8895 rad
* Velocity: 4.7885 m/s
* Acceleration: -1.9619 m/s²

**Obstacles State (t=0.9s):**

* **Obstacle 30212:**
    * Position: (470.2602, 335.3832)
    * Orientation: 0.8946 rad
    * Velocity: 7.6844 m/s
    * Acceleration: -0.9077 m/s²
* **Obstacle 30213:**
    * Position: (455.834, 329.0986)
    * Orientation: -0.5233 rad
    * Velocity: 7.9941 m/s
    * Acceleration: 0.1592 m/s²
* **Obstacle 30215:**
    * Position: (442.2686, 337.4302)
    * Orientation: -0.5685 rad
    * Velocity: 8.5355 m/s
    * Acceleration: 1.3309 m/s²
* **Obstacle 30217:**
    * Position: (444.8711, 298.1342)
    * Orientation: 0.8897 rad
    * Velocity: 8.2923 m/s
    * Acceleration: -2.6209 m/s²


**Analysis and Reasoning:**

Focusing on the most recent timestep (t=0.9s), we observe the following:

* **Obstacle 30217:** This obstacle shares the same lanelet (822) as the ego vehicle and is behind the ego vehicle.  Analyzing the previous timesteps, we see it's closing fast while ego is decelerating strongly.
* **Obstacle 30213:** At 0.9 seconds, there is no direct risk with Obstacle 30213 given their positions, velocities, and trajectory history.
* **Obstacle 30215:** Also does not pose an immediate collision risk. 
* **Obstacle 30212:** This obstacle also appears safe given the available data.


Given the ego vehicle's deceleration and Obstacle 30217's relatively faster velocity in the same lanelet, it poses the most significant risk. Obstacle 30217 represents the most immediate danger to the ego vehicle. To further quantify the risk, we'd need to project the trajectories of both vehicles over the next few seconds.

However, based on the current trends, there is a significant possibility of Obstacle 30217 colliding with the ego vehicle if the ego vehicle continues decelerating and Obstacle 30217 maintains its velocity.


**Risk Assessment:**

* **Obstacle 30212:** Overall Risk Score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
* **Obstacle 30213:** Overall Risk Score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
* **Obstacle 30215:** Overall Risk Score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
* **Obstacle 30217:** Overall Risk Score: 1 (Extreme Risk).  The high closing speed and shared lanelet suggest a very high probability of collision if current trends continue.
