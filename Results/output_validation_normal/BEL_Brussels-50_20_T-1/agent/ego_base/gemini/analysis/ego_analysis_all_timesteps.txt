At t=0.9s, obstacle 30213 is located front-left with a longitudinal distance of 7.12m and approaching at -3.53 m/s.  This represents a high risk as the time to collision is approximately 2 seconds. Obstacle 30215 is also front-left (5.05m longitudinal distance, -3.83m/s) and poses an even greater risk with a TTC of ~1.3 seconds. Obstacle 30217 is approaching from behind (-14.82m, 3.5 m/s) but is not an immediate threat. Obstacle 30212 is moving away longitudinally and does not pose a high risk. Therefore, obstacles 30213 and 30215 are considered high risk due to their proximity and closing velocities.
