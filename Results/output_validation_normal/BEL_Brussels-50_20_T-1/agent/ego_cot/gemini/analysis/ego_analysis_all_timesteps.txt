### Safety analysis for timestep 0.9s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

It's important to note that the provided scenario information lacks ego vehicle dimensions and precise obstacle positions, making accurate TTC and MDC calculations impossible.  Therefore, the analysis will be qualitative and based on the relative distances, velocities, and motion descriptions. We will assume that "real distance" approximates MDC.


### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 30212**
- Distance Risk reason: Located Front-Left at 21.09m longitudinally and laterally.  Large distance.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Moving away longitudinally and slightly away laterally. No TTC concern.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 30213**
- Distance Risk reason: Located Front-Left, relatively close at 7.12m longitudinally and laterally. Closing rapidly.
- Distance safety score: 2
- Time Risk reason:  Closing quickly both longitudinally and laterally. High risk of collision.
- Time safety score: 1
- Overall Risk score: 1

- **Obstacle ID: 30215**
- Distance Risk reason: Located Front-Left, very close at 5.05m longitudinally and laterally.  Closing rapidly.
- Distance safety score: 1
- Time Risk reason: Moving towards the ego vehicle rapidly. Imminent collision risk.
- Time safety score: 1
- Overall Risk score: 1

- **Obstacle ID: 30217**
- Distance Risk reason: Located behind at 14.82m. Not an immediate risk.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Although approaching from behind, the distance is sufficient. Not a high risk in this timestep.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3
