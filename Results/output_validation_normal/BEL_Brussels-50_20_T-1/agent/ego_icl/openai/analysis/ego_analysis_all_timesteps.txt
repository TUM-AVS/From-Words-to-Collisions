### Analysis

#### Obstacle 30212:
- **Location and Movement:** Front-left, moving away longitudinally (raw distances: 21.09m long, 2.13m lat).
- **Velocity and Acceleration:** Relative velocities: +2.90 m/s long, +0.04 m/s lat.
- **Trajectory Overview:** This obstacle is moving away longitudinally and laterally, indicating a low risk of collision.
- **TTC Calculation:** Since the obstacle is moving away, TTC is not applicable as it diverges.
- **MDC Calculation:** The distance is increasing; thus, MDC is greater than 5.0 meters.
- **Risk Assessment:** Negligible Risk (5).

#### Obstacle 30213:
- **Location and Movement:** Front-left, approaching both longitudinally and laterally (raw distances: 7.12m long, 9.37m lat).
- **Velocity and Acceleration:** Relative velocities: -3.53 m/s long, -7.89 m/s lat.
- **Trajectory Overview:** Both distances are decreasing, indicating this obstacle is converging with the ego vehicle's path.
- **TTC Calculation:** 
  - Longitudinal: TTC = 7.12m / 3.53 m/s ≈ 2.02 seconds.
  - Lateral: TTC = 9.37m / 7.89 m/s ≈ 1.19 seconds.
- **MDC Calculation:** Considering both dimensions are decreasing, MDC is also project to be near values less than 2.0 meters.
- **Risk Assessment:** Medium Risk (3).

#### Obstacle 30215:
- **Location and Movement:** Front-left, approaching both longitudinally and laterally (raw distances: 5.05m long, 25.16m lat).
- **Velocity and Acceleration:** Relative velocities: -3.83 m/s long, -8.48 m/s lat.
- **Trajectory Overview:** This obstacle moves mostly laterally but also longitudinally towards the ego vehicle at high speeds.
- **TTC Calculation:** 
  - Longitudinal: TTC = 5.05m / 3.83 m/s ≈ 1.32 seconds.
  - Lateral: TTC values are slower given the greater distance.
- **MDC Calculation:** The rapid convergence leads to a potential MDC close to 1-2 meters soon.
- **Risk Assessment:** Medium Risk (3).

#### Obstacle 30217:
- **Location and Movement:** Behind, approaching the ego vehicle with exact alignment (longitudinal -14.82 m, lateral 0.00 m).
- **Velocity and Acceleration:** Relative velocity: +3.50 m/s long.
- **Trajectory Overview:** Approaching from the rear, aligned, and closing, potentially risky.
- **TTC Calculation:** Longitudinal: TTC = 14.82m / 3.50 m/s ≈ 4.23 seconds.
- **MDC Calculation:** With closing part and potential future trajectory crossing, MDC expected low.
- **Risk Assessment:** Low Risk (4) due to imminent alignment and closing velocities.

### Conclusion

- **CollisionObstacle:** None identified.
- **ExtremeRiskObstacle:** None identified.
- **HighRiskObstacle:** None identified.
