At t=0.9s, Ego (30214.0) is in lanelet 822.0 at (457.0442, 313.1492).

Obstacle 30217.0 is also in lanelet 822.0 at (444.8711, 298.1342). While both are in the same lanelet, the y-coordinate difference suggests 30217.0 is significantly behind Ego.  Examining the previous timesteps confirms 30217.0 is approaching Ego from behind at a higher speed, however the distance at t=0.9s doesn't suggest an immediate collision. This represents a possible high or medium risk, but not extreme risk at the moment.

Obstacle 30212.0 is in lanelet 651.0 at (470.2602, 335.3832), Obstacle 30213.0 is in lanelet 885.0 at (455.834, 329.0986), and Obstacle 30215.0 is in lanelet 1690.0 at (442.2686, 337.4302).  None of these obstacles share the same lanelet as Ego and their positions don't indicate an immediate collision risk.
