At t=0.9s, Ego (30214.0) is in lanelet 822.0 at (457.0442, 313.1492). Obstacle 30217.0 is also in lanelet 822.0 at (444.8711, 298.1342).  While the y-coordinates suggest some lateral separation, the x-coordinates indicate 30217.0 is rapidly approaching Ego from behind, and previous timestamps show both objects' velocities.  The velocity difference and decreasing x-distance suggest a high probability of an imminent collision, if not in the next timestep, then very soon after. Other obstacles are far enough away to not pose an immediate threat.
