### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep:

### Obstacle Analysis:

#### Obstacle ID: 30211.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: Not present in the most recent timestep (0.9s). Last seen at 0.4s, moving away from ego's lanelet (1846.0 vs. ego's 822.0).
- **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- **Time Risk reason**: Not applicable (no recent data).
- **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- **Overall Risk score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)

#### Obstacle ID: 30212.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: Located in lanelet 651.0, which is not overlapping with ego's lanelet (822.0). Distance is increasing over time.
- **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- **Time Risk reason**: Moving away from ego with stable velocity (~7.68 m/s). No convergence in trajectories.
- **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- **Overall Risk score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)

#### Obstacle ID: 30213.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: Located in lanelet 885.0, not overlapping with ego's lanelet. Lateral distance is significant (~18m) and increasing.
- **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- **Time Risk reason**: Moving away from ego with ~8.0 m/s velocity. No risk of intersection.
- **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- **Overall Risk score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)

#### Obstacle ID: 30215.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: Located in lanelet 1690.0, far from ego's path. Lateral distance ~25m.
- **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- **Time Risk reason**: Moving away with ~8.5 m/s velocity. No convergence.
- **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- **Overall Risk score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)

#### Obstacle ID: 30217.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: Located in the same lanelet (822.0) as ego, but behind ego (~6.8m longitudinal distance). Ego is decelerating faster than obstacle.
- **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
- **Time Risk reason**: Relative velocity is ~3.5 m/s (ego: 4.79 m/s, obstacle: 8.29 m/s). TTC ~1.94s, but obstacle is decelerating (-2.62 m/s²).
- **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
- **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low Risk)

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. **Lanelet Analysis**: Only obstacle 30217.0 shares the same lanelet as ego (822.0).
2. **Trajectory Trends**: Ego is decelerating aggressively (-1.96 m/s²), while 30217.0 is also decelerating (-2.62 m/s²). Distance is increasing slightly.
3. **Collision Check**: No obstacles are on a direct collision path. Closest (30217.0) is behind and decelerating faster than ego.
4. **Conclusion**: No immediate collision risk. All obstacles are either moving away or sufficiently distant.
