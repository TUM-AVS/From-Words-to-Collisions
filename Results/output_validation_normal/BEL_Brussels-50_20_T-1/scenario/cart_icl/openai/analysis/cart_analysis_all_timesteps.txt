### Obstacle Analysis:

1. **Obstacle ID: 30208.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is located in a different lanelet (651.0) from the ego vehicle (822.0) and maintains a relatively constant distance from the ego, moving in parallel.
   - **Distance safety score**: 5
   - **Time Risk reason**: The obstacle's velocity is consistent, showing no abrupt changes in speed, and is not approaching the ego significantly.
   - **Time safety score**: 5
   - **Overall Risk score**: 5

2. **Obstacle ID: 30209.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Positioned consistently far from the ego in another lanelet (651.0), demonstrating a stable trajectory.
   - **Distance safety score**: 5
   - **Time Risk reason**: Velocity has remained steady, and the obstacle continues on a path parallel to the ego vehicle.
   - **Time safety score**: 5
   - **Overall Risk score**: 5

3. **Obstacle ID: 30212.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Also in a different lanelet (651.0) and moving consistently away from the ego vehicle.
   - **Distance safety score**: 5
   - **Time Risk reason**: Exhibits minor fluctuations in velocity and acceleration, but nothing that indicates an immediate collision risk.
   - **Time safety score**: 5
   - **Overall Risk score**: 5

4. **Obstacle ID: 30213.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Approaching the ego from behind, but its distance remains significant throughout the observed period.
   - **Distance safety score**: 4
   - **Time Risk reason**: Mostly consistent in velocity, with no drastic changes indicating immediate risk.
   - **Time safety score**: 4
   - **Overall Risk score**: 4

5. **Obstacle ID: 30215.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Positioned consistently far from the ego and shows predictable movement patterns.
   - **Distance safety score**: 5
   - **Time Risk reason**: A maintained velocity with predictable acceleration trends, posing no immediate time risk.
   - **Time safety score**: 5
   - **Overall Risk score**: 5

6. **Obstacle ID: 30216.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Located away and in a differing direction from the ego in lanelet 666.0.
   - **Distance safety score**: 5
   - **Time Risk reason**: Consistent velocity with no indication of sudden path changes.
   - **Time safety score**: 5
   - **Overall Risk score**: 5

7. **Obstacle ID: 30217.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: In the same lanelet (822.0) but positioned further away, moving generally parallel while maintaining significant separation.
   - **Distance safety score**: 3
   - **Time Risk reason**: Shows a deceleration trend, but trajectory remains parallel to ego.
   - **Time safety score**: 3
   - **Overall Risk score**: 3

8. **Obstacle ID: 30218.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: In a common lanelet (822.0) but also maintains a substantial distance from the ego vehicle.
   - **Distance safety score**: 4
   - **Time Risk reason**: Steady velocity and orientation indicate no urgent collision course.
   - **Time safety score**: 4
   - **Overall Risk score**: 4

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
All obstacles maintain their own lanes and preserve significant distances. Despite some sharing the same lanelet as the ego, no obstacle presents an immediate collision threat based on their velocities and accelerations. Therefore, this scenario is not a collision scenario.
