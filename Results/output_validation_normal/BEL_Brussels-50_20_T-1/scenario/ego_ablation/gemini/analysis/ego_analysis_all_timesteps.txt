Obstacle 30213 is approaching the ego vehicle longitudinally at -3.53 m/s and laterally at -7.89 m/s, with a longitudinal distance of 7.12 meters and a lateral distance of 9.37 meters.  This obstacle poses a high risk.

Obstacle 30215 is also approaching longitudinally at -3.83 m/s and laterally at -8.48 m/s, with a longitudinal distance of 5.05 meters and lateral distance of 25.16 meters. While the lateral distance is significant, the rapid longitudinal approach makes this obstacle a high risk as well. It's closer than 30213 longitudinally.

Obstacle 30217 is approaching from behind, but poses less of a risk due to the larger longitudinal distance and slower relative velocity compared to the front obstacles.

Obstacle 30212 is moving away longitudinally and is not a significant risk.

Given the rapid approach of Obstacle 30215, a collision is highly likely within the next few timesteps if no evasive action is taken.

  "ScenarioAnalysis": {
    "IsCollisionScenario": false,
    "Reasoning": "Obstacle 30215 poses an extreme risk due to its close proximity and high longitudinal closing velocity. While not a collision in this timestep, it is highly likely to collide in the next few timesteps without intervention.  Obstacle 30213 also poses a high risk, although slightly less than 30215 due to being a bit further away."
