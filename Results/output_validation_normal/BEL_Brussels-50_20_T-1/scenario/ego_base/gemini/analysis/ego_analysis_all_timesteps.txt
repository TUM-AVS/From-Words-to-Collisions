At t=0.9s, obstacle 30213 is closest to the ego car longitudinally (7.12m) and laterally (9.37m), approaching with a longitudinal velocity of -3.53 m/s and lateral velocity of -7.89 m/s.  Obstacle 30215 is also relatively close longitudinally (5.05m) but further away laterally (25.16m), also approaching the ego vehicle. While both obstacles are moving towards the ego vehicle, obstacle 30213 poses a more imminent risk given its proximity. Obstacle 30217, approaching from behind, is not an immediate concern at this timestep. Although the lateral distance of obstacle 30213 raises concerns, a collision is not guaranteed in the next timestep. It poses an extreme risk given its proximity and speed.
