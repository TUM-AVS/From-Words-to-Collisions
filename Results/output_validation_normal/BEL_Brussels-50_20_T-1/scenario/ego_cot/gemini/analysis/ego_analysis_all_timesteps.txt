### Safety analysis for timestep 0.9 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

It's important to note that the provided scenario description lacks crucial information needed for accurate TTC and MDC calculations.  We don't have ego vehicle dimensions or obstacle dimensions.  We also only have *relative* velocities and accelerations, not absolute values.  This makes precise calculation impossible. Therefore, the analysis will be qualitative, based on the provided relative motion descriptions and distances.

### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID:** 30212
- **Distance Risk reason:** Located Front-Left at 21.09m longitudinal and lateral distance.  This suggests a safe distance currently.
- **Distance safety score:** 5
- **Time Risk reason:**  Moving away longitudinally, slightly away laterally.  No immediate time-based risk indicated.
- **Time safety score:** 5
- **Overall Risk score:** 5

- **Obstacle ID:** 30213
- **Distance Risk reason:**  Located Front-Left at 7.12m longitudinal and lateral. This is relatively close and represents a potential risk.
- **Distance safety score:** 3
- **Time Risk reason:** Driving toward the ego car both longitudinally and laterally.  This represents a significant risk given the relatively short distance.
- **Time safety score:** 2
- **Overall Risk score:** 2 (High Risk)

- **Obstacle ID:** 30215
- **Distance Risk reason:** Located Front-Left at 5.05m longitudinal and lateral distance.  This is very close and poses an immediate threat.
- **Distance safety score:** 2
- **Time Risk reason:**  Driving toward the ego car both longitudinally and laterally. Combined with the close proximity, this suggests a high likelihood of collision soon.
- **Time safety score:** 1
- **Overall Risk score:** 1 (Extreme Risk)

- **Obstacle ID:** 30217
- **Distance Risk reason:** Located behind at -14.82m longitudinal distance. While approaching from behind, the distance currently provides a safety margin.
- **Distance safety score:** 4
- **Time Risk reason:** Driving toward the ego car from behind. The continuous approach requires monitoring, but the current distance and lack of lateral movement suggest no immediate danger.
- **Time safety score:** 4
- **Overall Risk score:** 4

  },
  "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {
    "ObstacleID": "30215",
    "OverallRiskScore": "1"
  },
  "IsCollisionScenario": false,
  "Justification": "Obstacle 30215 poses an extreme risk with a very high likelihood of collision in the near future due to its proximity and movement towards the ego vehicle. While not an immediate collision, the current trajectory strongly indicates a collision if no evasive action is taken."
