* **Obstacle 30212:**

    * **Trajectory:** This obstacle has been consistently in the front-left of the ego vehicle, with the longitudinal distance generally increasing and the lateral distance slightly decreasing over the observed timesteps. This suggests a diverging trajectory longitudinally and a slow converging trajectory laterally.

    * **TTC Calculation:**
        * Longitudinal TTC = 21.09m / 2.90m/s ≈ 7.27s
        * Lateral TTC = 2.13m / 0.04m/s ≈ 53.25s (effectively no risk laterally as the obstacle is slightly moving away laterally in the latest timestep.)

    * **MDC:** Considering the trajectory and the relative velocities, the MDC would be the lateral distance of 2.13m.

    * **Risk Assessment:**  Based on TTC and MDC, the risk level for this obstacle is 4 (Low Risk).


* **Obstacle 30213:**

    * **Trajectory:** This obstacle has been consistently in the front-left of the ego vehicle, with both longitudinal and lateral distances decreasing across timesteps. This indicates a converging trajectory, potentially leading to a collision.

    * **TTC Calculation:**
        * Longitudinal TTC = 7.12m / 3.53m/s ≈ 2.02s
        * Lateral TTC = 9.37m / 7.89m/s ≈ 1.19s

    * **MDC:** Given the converging trajectory and the fact that both longitudinal and lateral distances are decreasing, the MDC is approximately 7.12 meters.

    * **Risk Assessment:** Based on both TTC and MDC values, the risk level is 3 (Medium Risk - monitoring required, potential collision within the next few seconds).

* **Obstacle 30215:**

    * **Trajectory:** This obstacle appears in the last two timesteps and is also in the front-left, showing a rapidly decreasing longitudinal distance and lateral distance. Its trajectory suggests a high risk of collision.

    * **TTC Calculation:**
        * Longitudinal TTC = 5.05m / 3.83m/s ≈ 1.32s
        * Lateral TTC = 25.16m / 8.48m/s ≈ 2.97s

    * **MDC:** Similar to Obstacle 30213, MDC is the current longitudinal distance of 5.05m since it is smaller than the lateral distance and is rapidly closing.

    * **Risk Assessment:** This obstacle poses a Medium Risk (3) due to the closing distance and TTC values, though with less immediate concern than 30213 in the longitudinal direction but more concern laterally than 30213.

* **Obstacle 30217:**

    * **Trajectory:** This obstacle is behind the ego vehicle and has maintained exact lateral alignment, with a decreasing longitudinal distance. It is rapidly approaching the ego vehicle from behind.

    * **TTC Calculation:**
        * Longitudinal TTC = 14.82m / 3.50m/s ≈ 4.23s

    * **MDC:** Given the perfect lateral alignment (0.00m) and the decreasing longitudinal distance, the MDC is effectively the longitudinal distance of -14.82m. While this represents a significant risk, the fact that the obstacle is behind makes an immediate collision less likely than if it were in front. Note that negative MDC here might indicate a calculation error. However, as the obstacle is behind, this is interpreted in conjunction with the relative motion.

    * **Risk Assessment:**  Based on TTC and the context of the motion description, the risk level is 4 (Low Risk).


**Collision Scenario Determination:**

No obstacle has a risk score of 0 or 1. Therefore, this is NOT a collision scenario at the current timestep. However, obstacle 30213 presents a medium risk, requiring careful monitoring due to its converging trajectory.
