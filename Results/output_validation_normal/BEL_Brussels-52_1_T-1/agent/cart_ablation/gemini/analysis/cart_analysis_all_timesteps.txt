Obstacle 30235 is in the same lane as the ego vehicle (lanelet 122) and initially poses the greatest risk.  The y-coordinates remain relatively close, and the x-coordinate difference shrinks over the timesteps. While obstacle 30235 decelerates from 0.1s to 0.9s overall, its deceleration isn't consistent enough to rule out a collision possibility, especially considering the ego vehicle is also decelerating, and briefly even accelerates between 0.5 and 0.6 seconds. Given the closing distance and somewhat erratic decelerations, this situation warrants a high-risk assessment. Obstacle 30237, also in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle, appears later in the scenario and represents a low risk due to the larger initial separation. Obstacle 30229 and 30230 are in different lanelets and do not present immediate risk.
