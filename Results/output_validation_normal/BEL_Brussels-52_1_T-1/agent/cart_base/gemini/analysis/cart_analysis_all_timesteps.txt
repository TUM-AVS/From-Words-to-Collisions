Obstacle 30235 is in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle and initially approaching from behind.  The initial distance is substantial but decreases over the provided timeframe. While the closing velocity is significant in the first few timesteps, obstacle 30235's velocity decreases significantly between timesteps 0.6 and 0.7 seconds, and continues decreasing afterward.  This braking behavior suggests a potential collision risk if the deceleration continues or if ego's braking is insufficient. Obstacle 30237 also appears in the same lanelet as ego vehicle but from a further distance and with a slower speed which may lead to a medium/low risk collision if both obstacle and ego don't change speed/direction. Obstacle 30229 and 30230 are in different lanelets and show no immediate risk.
