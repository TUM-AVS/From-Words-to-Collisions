### Analysis:

1. **Obstacle 30230**:  
   - **Position**: (-450.8974, 247.1569) at 0.9s  
   - **Relative Motion**: Moving away from ego vehicle (lateral distance increasing).  
   - **TTC**: Not applicable (moving away).  
   - **Risk**: **Negligible (5)**  

2. **Obstacle 30235**:  
   - **Position**: (-476.8846, 262.8074) at 0.9s  
   - **Relative Motion**: In the same lanelet (122.0) as ego, but decelerating rapidly (acceleration = -2.6042).  
   - **Distance to Ego**: ~13.6m (calculated from positions).  
   - **TTC**: ~2.7s (assuming constant deceleration).  
   - **Risk**: **Medium (3)** (Manageable with proper reaction).  

3. **Obstacle 30237**:  
   - **Position**: (-488.1837, 269.6551) at 0.9s  
   - **Relative Motion**: In the same lanelet (122.0), decelerating (acceleration = -1.9201).  
   - **Distance to Ego**: ~25.3m (calculated from positions).  
   - **TTC**: ~4.0s (assuming constant deceleration).  
   - **Risk**: **Low (4)** (Sufficient time to react).
