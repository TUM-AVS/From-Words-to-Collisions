At t=0.9s, the ego vehicle's position is (-463.2956, 254.5633) with a velocity of 4.96 m/s and an acceleration of 0.66 m/s².  We'll analyze each obstacle relative to the ego vehicle at this timestep.

* **Obstacle 30230:** Position (-450.8974, 247.1569), velocity 7.39 m/s, acceleration -0.04 m/s². This obstacle is in a different lanelet (1321 vs. ego's 122) and poses no immediate threat.  Lateral distance is significant, and longitudinal velocity difference is not alarming. Risk: **Negligible (5)**.

* **Obstacle 30235:** Position (-476.8846, 262.8074), velocity 7.01 m/s, acceleration -2.60 m/s².  This obstacle is in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle (122).  It's ahead of the ego vehicle, and although its velocity is higher, it's decelerating significantly. Calculations:
    * Longitudinal distance: -476.8846 - (-463.2956) = -13.59 m (ego is behind).
    * Lateral distance:  262.8074 - 254.5633 ≈ 8.24m. This significant lateral distance suggests the cars aren't directly in each others path. Thus, despite being in the same lanelet, they likely represent two different lanes.  Risk: **Low (4)**.

* **Obstacle 30237:** Position (-490.4525, 271.0301), velocity 6.78 m/s, acceleration 0.33 m/s². Although the longitudinal distance is slightly greater than that of 30235, the lateral distance is even larger:
    * Lateral distance: 271.0301 - 254.5633 ≈ 16.47m.
    * Longitudinal distance: -490.4525 - (-463.2956) ≈ -27.16m.
There is a substantial lateral separation between the vehicles, making a collision improbable. The difference in longitudinal velocity is also modest. Risk: **Negligible (5)**.
