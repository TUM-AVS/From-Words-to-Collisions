Upon analyzing the scenario described for the most recent timestep at 0.9 seconds, the following observations and risk assessments have been made concerning the risk of collision with each obstacle based on their trajectories and relative positions to the ego vehicle:

1. **Obstacle 30230**:
   - Current Position: (-450.8974, 247.1569)
   - Current Velocity: 7.3884 m/s
   - The obstacle is located approximately 12.3982 meters longitudinally from the ego vehicle with a slight lateral gap. Despite its relatively high speed, the obstacle is in a different lanelet (1321) and appears to be drifting further laterally southwards. Considering this movement, the risk of immediate collision is low.

2. **Obstacle 30235**:
   - Current Position: (-476.8846, 262.8074)
   - Current Velocity: 7.0127 m/s
   - This obstacle is moving in the same lanelet (122) as the ego vehicle. Its relative position and movement propose that it is ahead, with a 13.5890-meter longitudinal gap. Despite the shared lane, the steady deceleration and growing gap indicate there is no current high risk of collision.

3. **Obstacle 30237**:
   - Current Position: (-488.1837, 269.6551)
   - Current Velocity: 6.3161 m/s
   - This obstacle is also in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle, positioned approximately 24.8881 meters ahead. With observed deceleration and the significant gap, it presents a low risk of collision.

Given the proximity and speed, none of the obstacles are showing high collision risk at the current trajectory and deceleration as observed. The minimal potential for collision is reflected in the following summary JSON:

```json
{
    "CollisionObstacles": [],
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {},
    "HighRiskObstacle": {}
}
```

This output outlines that there are currently no obstacles at immediate risk of collision (risk scores 0 or 1). If any obstacles were to introduce increased dynamic changes in speed or direction in the future moments following this, further evaluation would then be needed.
