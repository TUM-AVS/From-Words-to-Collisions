At t=0.9s, obstacle 30235 is behind the ego vehicle at a longitudinal distance of -11.39m and moving towards the ego with a longitudinal relative velocity of 2.05 m/s.  Given the decreasing distance and positive relative velocity (meaning obstacle 30235 is closing in from behind), this obstacle poses a high risk.  The lateral distance being zero is also a concern.

Obstacle 30237 is also approaching from behind, but is further away (-24.60m) and traveling with a lower longitudinal relative velocity (1.35 m/s), therefore it is classified as low/medium risk.

Obstacle 30230 is moving away from the ego vehicle and does not pose a risk.
