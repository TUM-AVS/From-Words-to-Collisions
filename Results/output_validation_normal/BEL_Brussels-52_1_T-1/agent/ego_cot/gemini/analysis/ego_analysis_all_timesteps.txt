### Safety analysis for timestep 0.9s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 30230**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is located in front of the ego vehicle at a lateral distance of 9.93m and a longitudinal distance of 9.93m.  The obstacle is moving away longitudinally with a positive relative velocity.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: The obstacle is moving away from the ego vehicle.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 30235**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is located behind the ego vehicle at a lateral distance of -11.39m and a longitudinal distance of -11.39m. The obstacle is approaching the ego vehicle from behind, as indicated by the negative longitudinal distance and positive relative longitudinal velocity.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Although the obstacle is approaching, the rate is moderate.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 30237**
- Distance Risk reason: Located behind the ego vehicle at a lateral distance of -24.60m and a longitudinal distance of -24.60m. While the obstacle is driving toward the ego vehicle (positive relative longitudinal velocity), the distance is significant.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: The closing velocity is relatively low.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5
