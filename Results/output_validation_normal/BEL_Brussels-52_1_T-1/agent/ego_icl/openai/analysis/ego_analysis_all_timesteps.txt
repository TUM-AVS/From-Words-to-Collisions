### Obstacle-by-Obstacle Analysis

**Obstacle 30230**
- **Direction**: Front
- **Adjusted Distance**: Longitudinal 9.93 m, Lateral 0.00 m
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal 2.42 m/s, Lateral 0.15 m/s (moving away)
- **Trajectory**: The obstacle is moving away from the ego vehicle. Increasing longitudinal distances over time show that the gap is widening.
- **TTC Calculation**: Since the obstacle is moving away, TTC isn't applicable as there's no impending collision in the longitudinal direction.
- **MDC Calculation**: The longitudinal adjusted distance of 9.93 m and a longitudinal trajectory moving away indicates no collision within immediate timeframe.

**Risk Assessment**: With increasing distance and non-converging trajectories, the risk is negligible.

**Obstacle 30235**
- **Direction**: Behind
- **Adjusted Distance**: Longitudinal 11.39 m (behind), Lateral 0.00 m
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal 2.05 m/s (approaching), Lateral 0.02 m/s
- **Trajectory**: The obstacle is closing the gap to the ego vehicle from behind, but note a decrease in relative velocity, indicating slowing down gradually and negative acceleration, contributes to reduced collision probability.
- **TTC Calculation**: TTC = 11.39 / 2.05 ≈ 5.56 seconds
- **MDC Calculation**: With longitudinal alignment maintained and slowing down, the minimum distance maintains safe margin without collision risk.

**Risk Assessment**: With TTC beyond 5 seconds and a reducing closing speed, the risk is low.

**Obstacle 30237**
- **Direction**: Behind
- **Adjusted Distance**: Longitudinal 24.60 m (behind), Lateral 0.00 m
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal 1.35 m/s (approaching), Lateral 0.02 m/s
- **Trajectory**: This obstacle also shows approaching behavior but at a slower speed, with non-significant longitudinal acceleration affecting closing velocity.
- **TTC Calculation**: TTC = 24.60 / 1.35 ≈ 18.22 seconds
- **MDC Calculation**: Well maintained at a considerable distance, with clear stable trajectory away from critical proximity.

**Risk Assessment**: With both the distance and a slow approach, there is no significant risk.

**Conclusion**: No immediate collision or extreme risk was detected for any obstacle, as trajectories demonstrate increasing distances or TTCs well beyond thresholds that would entail significant risk. The analysis concludes that all obstacles present negligible risk under current trajectory projections.
