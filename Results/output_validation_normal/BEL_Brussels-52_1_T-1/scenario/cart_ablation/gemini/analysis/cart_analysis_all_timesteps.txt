At t=0.9s, Ego is in lanelet 122. Let's analyze the obstacles:

* **Obstacle 30235:**  This obstacle is also in lanelet 122, relatively close to the Ego, and both are moving in roughly the same direction (similar orientations). While obstacle 30235's velocity is decreasing, the positions suggest a possible very near-term collision or extreme risk.

* **Obstacle 30237:** This obstacle is also in lanelet 122.  Its position (-488.1837, 269.6551) is further behind Ego (-463.2956, 254.5633) than Obstacle 30235. While also moving in a similar direction, the distance and velocity difference suggest a lower risk than Obstacle 30235.

* **Obstacle 30230:** This obstacle is in a different lanelet (1321), and its position indicates no immediate risk to Ego.
