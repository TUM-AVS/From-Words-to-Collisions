### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep (0.9 seconds):

### Obstacle Analysis:
1. **Obstacle ID: 30230**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is in lanelet 1321, which is adjacent to the ego's lanelet (122). The distance between them is decreasing over time, but not directly in the same lane.
   - **Distance safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: The obstacle is moving at 7.3884 m/s, slightly faster than the ego (4.9633 m/s), but not directly towards the ego. The relative velocity is not alarming.
   - **Time safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 3 (Medium Risk)

2. **Obstacle ID: 30235**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is in the same lanelet (122) as the ego, and the distance is decreasing. The obstacle is behind the ego but closing the gap.
   - **Distance safety score**: 2 (High Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: The obstacle is moving at 7.0127 m/s, faster than the ego (4.9633 m/s). The relative velocity is concerning, but the obstacle is still behind.
   - **Time safety score**: 2 (High Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 2 (High Risk)

3. **Obstacle ID: 30237**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is in the same lanelet (122) as the ego, but is behind and not closing the gap as quickly as 30235.
   - **Distance safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: The obstacle is moving at 6.3161 m/s, faster than the ego, but decelerating. The relative velocity is not immediately dangerous.
   - **Time safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 3 (Medium Risk)

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. **Obstacle 30230**: Not in the same lane, but close. Medium risk due to proximity and speed.
2. **Obstacle 30235**: Same lane, behind, and closing in. High risk due to relative velocity and proximity.
3. **Obstacle 30237**: Same lane, behind, but not closing in as fast. Medium risk.
4. No immediate collision (risk score 0) or extreme risk (risk score 1) obstacles detected.

{
    "CollisionObstacles": null,
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null,
    "ScenarioAnalysis": {
        "IsCollisionScenario": false,
        "Reasoning": "No obstacles are in immediate collision or extreme risk. Obstacle 30235 poses the highest risk (High Risk) due to being in the same lane and closing the gap, but no collision is imminent."
