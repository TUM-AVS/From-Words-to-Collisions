### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep (0.9s): Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 30229.0
- Distance Risk reason: Lateral separation is significant, and longitudinal separation is also safe. Trajectory suggests divergence.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Obstacle moving with a different orientation, posing no immediate threat.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 30230.0
- Distance Risk reason: Safe lateral and longitudinal separation.  Trajectory analysis suggests no convergence.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason:  Relative velocity and acceleration don't indicate any immediate risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 30231.0
- Distance Risk reason: Significant lateral and longitudinal separation; no risk observed. Trajectory suggests no convergence.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Although moving faster, the trajectory suggests divergence.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 30233.0
- Distance Risk reason: Significant lateral and longitudinal separation; no risk observed.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Trajectory analysis shows no imminent threat.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 30234.0
- Distance Risk reason: Significant lateral and longitudinal separation; no risk observed.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason:  Trajectory analysis shows no imminent threat.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 30235.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is behind the ego vehicle and in the same lane, but with safe longitudinal separation.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Obstacle's velocity is higher but decelerating.  Monitoring needed.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- Obstacle ID: 30236.0
- Distance Risk reason: Significant lateral and longitudinal separation; no risk observed.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Trajectory analysis shows no imminent threat.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 30237.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is behind ego in the same lane but at a safe distance.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Obstacle is moving slower than ego and decelerating; low risk.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4


### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
No obstacles pose an immediate collision risk.  Obstacles 30235.0 and 30237.0 are in the same lane and behind the ego vehicle, but at a safe distance and with lower velocities, so they require monitoring but are not a collision risk.  This is not a collision scenario.

### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
  "CollisionObstacles": [],
  "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null,
  "ScenarioAnalysis": {
    "IsCollisionScenario": false,
    "Reasoning": "No obstacle has a risk score of 0 or 1.  Closest obstacles are behind the ego vehicle at a safe distance and with lower velocities, thus requiring monitoring but posing no immediate collision risk."
  }
}
