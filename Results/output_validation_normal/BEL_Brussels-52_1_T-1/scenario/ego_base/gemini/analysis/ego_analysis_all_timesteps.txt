At t=0.9s, obstacle 30235 is behind the ego vehicle at a longitudinal distance of -11.39m (closing rapidly) and a lateral distance of 0.0m.  Its relative longitudinal velocity is 2.05 m/s, meaning it is approaching the ego vehicle quickly. Although the relative longitudinal acceleration is negative (-2.79 m/sÂ²), suggesting some braking, the obstacle is still very close and the closing rate is substantial. This poses a high risk of collision. Obstacles 30230 and 30237 pose no immediate collision risk.
