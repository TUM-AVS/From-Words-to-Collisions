### Safety analysis for timestep 0.9 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

**Assumptions and Clarifications:**

* Since "adjusted distances" are explicitly requested but not provided in the context, the provided real distances (DTClong, DTClat) will be used directly.  However, ideally, these values should be adjusted for vehicle size.
* The analysis assumes a collision occurs when *both* longitudinal and lateral distances are effectively zero. In a real-world scenario, vehicle dimensions would be considered.
* TTC will be approximated using distance/relative velocity.  This simplification assumes constant velocity.  Ideally, relative acceleration should also be incorporated for a more accurate TTC calculation.

### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 30230**
    - Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is in front of the ego vehicle at a longitudinal distance of 9.93m and a lateral distance of 9.93m. This indicates no immediate risk.
    - Distance safety score: 5
    - Time Risk reason:  The obstacle is moving away longitudinally with a positive relative velocity (2.42 m/s), indicating no risk of collision.
    - Time safety score: 5
    - Overall Risk score: 5
- **Obstacle ID: 30235**
    - Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is behind the ego vehicle with a longitudinal distance of -11.39m and a lateral distance of -11.39m. This currently poses no immediate collision risk, but needs continuous monitoring as the obstacle is approaching from behind.
    - Distance safety score: 4
    - Time Risk reason: Obstacle is approaching the ego vehicle from behind (Vrel_long = 2.05 m/s). The negative distance combined with the positive relative velocity towards the ego car indicates a potential future risk if the ego vehicle were to brake suddenly.
    - Time safety score: 3
    - Overall Risk score: 3
- **Obstacle ID: 30237**
    - Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is behind the ego vehicle with a longitudinal distance of -24.60m and a lateral distance of -24.60m. Although it is approaching from behind, it's relatively far, implying a lower immediate risk.
    - Distance safety score: 4
    - Time Risk reason: While the obstacle is driving toward the ego car (Vrel_long = 1.35 m/s), the significant longitudinal distance provides ample time to react.
    - Time safety score: 4
    - Overall Risk score: 4
