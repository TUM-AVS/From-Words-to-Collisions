### Obstacle-by-Obstacle Analysis (Most Recent Timestep: 0.9 seconds)

#### **Obstacle 30230 (Front)**
- **Adjusted Distance**: Longitudinal 9.93m, Lateral 0.00m  
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal 2.42 m/s (moving away), Lateral 0.15 m/s (small lateral drift)  
- **Motion**: Moving away longitudinally with slight lateral drift.  
- **TTC**:  
  - Longitudinal: Not applicable (moving away).  
  - Lateral: 0.00m / 0.15 m/s = 0.00s (but lateral drift is minimal and not converging).  
- **MDC**:  
  - Lateral distance is 0.00m (aligned), but longitudinal distance is increasing.  
  - No collision path.  
- **Risk**: **5 (No Risk)** – No convergence in either dimension.

#### **Obstacle 30235 (Behind)**
- **Adjusted Distance**: Longitudinal -11.39m, Lateral 0.00m  
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal 2.05 m/s (approaching from behind), Lateral 0.02 m/s (negligible).  
- **Motion**: Approaching from behind but decelerating (relative acceleration = -2.79 m/s²).  
- **TTC**:  
  - Longitudinal: 11.39m / 2.05 m/s = **5.56s** (but decelerating).  
  - Lateral: Not applicable (stable).  
- **MDC**:  
  - Lateral alignment (0.00m), but longitudinal distance is closing slowly.  
- **Risk**: **4 (Low Risk)** – TTC > 5s, decelerating, no immediate threat.

#### **Obstacle 30237 (Behind)**
- **Adjusted Distance**: Longitudinal -24.60m, Lateral 0.00m  
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal 1.35 m/s (approaching slowly), Lateral 0.02 m/s (negligible).  
- **Motion**: Approaching from behind but decelerating (relative acceleration = -2.21 m/s²).  
- **TTC**:  
  - Longitudinal: 24.60m / 1.35 m/s = **18.22s** (very slow approach).  
  - Lateral: Not applicable (stable).  
- **MDC**:  
  - Lateral alignment (0.00m), but longitudinal distance is large and closing very slowly.  
- **Risk**: **5 (No Risk)** – TTC extremely high, decelerating.

### Trajectory Analysis
- **Obstacle 30230**: Moving away longitudinally with slight lateral drift. No collision risk.  
- **Obstacle 30235**: Approaching from behind but decelerating. Risk is low due to high TTC and deceleration.  
- **Obstacle 30237**: Very slow approach from far behind. No risk.  

### Final Determination
- **No obstacles** are at **Collision (0)** or **Extreme Risk (1)**.  
- The closest risk is **Low Risk (4)** from Obstacle 30235, but it is decelerating and not an immediate threat.
