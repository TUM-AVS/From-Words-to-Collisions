*Obstacle Analysis at t=0.9s:*

**Obstacle 30230:**

* **Trajectory:** This obstacle has been consistently in front of the ego vehicle and moving away throughout the provided timeframe.  Its longitudinal distance from the ego vehicle is increasing.
* **Longitudinal Analysis:** The obstacle is moving away longitudinally at 2.42 m/s.  Given the increasing distance and the direction of movement, there is no longitudinal collision risk. TTC calculation is not meaningful here because the relative velocity is negative (moving away).
* **Lateral Analysis:**  Lateral distance is 0.00m (exact alignment). However, the lateral relative velocity is 0.15 m/s, indicating a slight lateral divergence. This does not represent a collision risk since the longitudinal motion is separating the vehicles. MDC = 0.00m, which alone might suggest a collision, but is not accurate considering the full trajectory and motion description.
* **Risk Assessment:**  Longitudinal movement is clearly separating the vehicles. The exact lateral alignment is not a concern due to the diverging longitudinal trajectories. Overall Risk: 5 (No Risk)

**Obstacle 30235:**

* **Trajectory:**  This obstacle has been consistently behind the ego vehicle and approaching throughout the entire duration.  It shows a persistent closing longitudinal velocity.
* **Longitudinal Analysis:** The obstacle is approaching longitudinally with a velocity of 2.05 m/s, with a decreasing relative longitudinal distance of -11.39m.  TTC = 11.39m / 2.05m/s ≈ 5.56 seconds
* **Lateral Analysis:** The obstacle maintains an exact lateral alignment (0.00m) across the majority of the duration. The lateral relative velocity is minimal (0.02 m/s), not suggesting immediate risk. MDC = 0.00m. While the lateral alignment and near-zero MDC might initially suggest a collision risk, the motion descriptions across timesteps clarifies it's in the same lane and behind. The primary risk assessment here should come from longitudinal components due to trailing vehicle.
* **Risk Assessment:** Although the lateral alignment and small MDC are present, the larger longitudinal distance, moderate TTC, and the obstacle's position and motion confirm this is not an imminent collision risk. Risk: 4 (Low Risk - due to closing longitudinal distance)


**Obstacle 30237:**

* **Trajectory:** This obstacle appears at t=0.5s behind the ego vehicle and has been consistently approaching since then.
* **Longitudinal Analysis:** At t=0.9s, this obstacle is approaching with a longitudinal velocity of 1.35 m/s. Relative Distance is -24.60m. TTC = 24.60 / 1.35 ≈ 18.22s
* **Lateral Analysis:** Maintains exact lateral alignment (0.00m). Lateral relative velocity is minimal (0.02 m/s). MDC = 0.00m.  Similar to Obstacle 30235, this seems behind and in same lane, so longitudinal risk assesment is prioritized.
* **Risk Assessment:** Large longitudinal distance, high TTC, and the obstacle's position and motion indicate no immediate collision risk.  Risk: 5 (No Risk)


**Collision Scenario Determination:**

No obstacle has a risk score of 0 or 1. Therefore, this is NOT a collision scenario.
