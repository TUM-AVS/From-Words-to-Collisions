Obstacle 30206 is in a different lanelet (1506) than the ego vehicle (381), so it's unlikely to collide, despite the relatively close proximity.

Obstacle 30209 is in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle and initially appears to be approaching from behind at a higher speed. However, its speed fluctuates and at times decreases significantly (e.g., between 0.7s and 0.8s its velocity drops from 6.143 to 5.8191). More importantly, the distance between the ego vehicle and this obstacle consistently decreases over the observed time steps, increasing the risk of a collision. At 0.1 seconds the x difference is ~5.36 and by 0.9 seconds it shrinks to ~5.45 indicating a slow but concerning closing speed.

Obstacle 30210 is also in the same lanelet and is ahead of the ego vehicle. It maintains a safe distance and doesn't pose an immediate threat based on the provided data.

Given the continuous decrease in the distance between the ego and Obstacle 30209, and its erratic speed changes, it represents a high risk.  While a collision isn't imminent in the next immediate time step, the trend suggests a potential collision if the vehicles maintain their current trajectories and speeds.  Therefore, a risk score of 2 (High Risk) is assigned to obstacle 30209.
