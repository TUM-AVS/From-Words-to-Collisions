Obstacle 30206 is in a different lanelet (1506) than the ego vehicle (381), so it's unlikely to collide even though the absolute distance might appear close at some points.

Obstacle 30209 is in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle and initially exhibits concerning behavior. It starts relatively close to the ego vehicle and has a higher velocity.  However, its behavior changes significantly.  It decelerates quickly between 0.7 seconds and 0.8 seconds, then shows more moderate changes in velocity afterwards. This deceleration creates more of a following situation than a head-on collision risk. By the last time step, the situation has evolved to where it is still a concern but merits further observation rather than being flagged as an extreme risk.

Obstacle 30210 is also in the same lanelet and is further ahead of the ego vehicle. While it has some fluctuations in acceleration, it doesn't present an immediate collision risk throughout the observed timeframe.

Because of the distance, the other vehicles do not present an immediate collision risk. Obstacle 30209 requires monitoring due to its proximity and initial speed difference, classifying it as a high risk.
