Here's a collision risk analysis of the provided scenario focusing on the last timestep (0.9 seconds) and utilizing previous timesteps for trajectory prediction:

**Scenario at 0.9 seconds:**

* **Ego (30208.0):** Position (-79.9459, 170.8812), Orientation -1.1561, Velocity 5.6864, Acceleration 0.0004, Lanelet 381.0
* **Obstacle 30206.0:** Position (-74.8264, 159.246), Orientation -1.1563, Velocity 5.0682, Acceleration -0.6139, Lanelet 1506.0
* **Obstacle 30209.0:** Position (-85.3923, 183.4481), Orientation -1.1604, Velocity 5.7404, Acceleration 0.0399, Lanelet 381.0
* **Obstacle 30210.0:** Position (-91.6047, 197.729), Orientation -1.1604, Velocity 5.5589, Acceleration -0.2415, Lanelet 381.0

**Analysis:**

1. **Ego vs. Obstacle 30206.0:**  This obstacle is in a different lanelet (1506.0) than the ego vehicle (381.0). While the Y-coordinates indicate some longitudinal separation, the X-coordinates show proximity. However, given the different lanelets and the observed trajectories, the risk of collision is low.  Risk Score: 4 (Low Risk)

2. **Ego vs. Obstacle 30209.0:** This obstacle is in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle. The obstacle is ahead of the ego vehicle in terms of Y-position and slightly to the left in X-position. The velocities are also similar.  Crucially, analyzing the trajectories from preceding timesteps shows the obstacle getting closer to the ego in the Y-direction, though it's consistently to the left and accelerating negligibly. While a collision isn't imminent, the closing distance and same lanelet warrant attention. Risk Score: 2 (High Risk)

3. **Ego vs. Obstacle 30210.0:** This obstacle is also in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle and significantly further ahead in the Y-direction. The obstacle is also positioned to the ego vehicle's left (more negative X). The consistent separation in previous timesteps and the obstacle's current trajectory suggest minimal risk.  Risk Score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
