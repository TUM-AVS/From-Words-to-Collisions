### Analysis:

1. **Obstacle 30206 (Lanelet 1506.0)**:
   - Position: (-74.8264, 159.246)
   - Orientation: -1.1563
   - Velocity: 5.0682 m/s
   - Acceleration: -0.6139 m/s²
   - Relative to Ego: The obstacle is in a different lanelet (1506.0) and is moving away from the ego vehicle. The lateral distance is significant, and there is no immediate risk of collision.
   - **Overall Risk Score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)

2. **Obstacle 30209 (Lanelet 381.0)**:
   - Position: (-85.3923, 183.4481)
   - Orientation: -1.1604
   - Velocity: 5.7404 m/s
   - Acceleration: 0.0399 m/s²
   - Relative to Ego: The obstacle is in the same lanelet (381.0) as the ego vehicle. The distance between the ego and the obstacle is decreasing, but the relative velocity is not high enough to pose an immediate risk. The TTC is still reasonable.
   - **Overall Risk Score**: 3 (Medium Risk)

3. **Obstacle 30210 (Lanelet 381.0)**:
   - Position: (-91.6047, 197.729)
   - Orientation: -1.1604
   - Velocity: 5.5589 m/s
   - Acceleration: -0.2415 m/s²
   - Relative to Ego: The obstacle is in the same lanelet (381.0) as the ego vehicle. The distance between the ego and the obstacle is increasing, and the relative velocity is not a concern.
   - **Overall Risk Score**: 4 (Low Risk)
