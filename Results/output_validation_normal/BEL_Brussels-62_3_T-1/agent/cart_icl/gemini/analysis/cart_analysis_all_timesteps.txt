At t=0.9s, the ego vehicle is at (-79.95, 170.88) with a velocity of 5.69 m/s and heading -1.16 rad.  Let's analyze each obstacle:

* **Obstacle 30206:** Located at (-74.83, 159.25), this obstacle is in a different lanelet (1506 vs. ego's 381). The significant lateral separation and the different lanelet suggest a low risk despite the relatively close longitudinal distance.  We can approximate TTC by considering the longitudinal velocity differences, assuming the lateral distance remains roughly constant. This obstacle poses no immediate threat. Risk: **Low (4)**

* **Obstacle 30209:** Located at (-85.39, 183.45). This obstacle is in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle (381).  The obstacle is ahead of the ego and to the left.  While the lateral separation is notable, the similar headings and longitudinal velocities warrant further scrutiny. Given the data, we can estimate the TTC and MDC. This obstacle poses no immediate threat but deserves attention. Risk: **Medium (3)**

* **Obstacle 30210:** Located at (-91.60, 197.73). This obstacle is also in the same lanelet (381) and significantly ahead of the ego vehicle and to the left.  The distances, combined with similar orientations, suggest no immediate collision risk. Risk: **Low (4)**
