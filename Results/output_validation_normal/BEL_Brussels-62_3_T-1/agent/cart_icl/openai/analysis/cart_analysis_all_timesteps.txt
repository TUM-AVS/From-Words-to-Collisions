During the analysis of the provided autonomous driving scenario, I focused on the most recent timestep (0.9 seconds) and evaluated the motion trends of each obstacle compared to the ego vehicle.

1. **Ego Vehicle (30208.0 at 0.9s):**
   - Position: (-79.9459, 170.8812)
   - Orientation: -1.1560898398470902
   - Velocity: 5.6864 m/s

2. **Obstacle 30206.0 at 0.9s:**
   - Position: (-74.8264, 159.246)
   - Orientation: -1.1563
   - Velocity: 5.0682 m/s
   - The obstacle is located in a different lanelet (1506.0) and continuing to travel parallel to the ego vehicle. The lateral displacement and difference in lanelet signify no immediate collision risk.

3. **Obstacle 30209.0 at 0.9s:**
   - Position: (-85.3923, 183.4481)
   - Orientation: -1.1604
   - Velocity: 5.7404 m/s
   - The obstacle remains in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle (381.0), and the closing distance suggests a potential collision risk. Evaluating relative motion, the ego vehicle appears to keep pace with the obstacle. Monitoring is advised due to small velocity differences and shared lanelet.

4. **Obstacle 30210.0 at 0.9s:**
   - Position: (-91.6047, 197.729)
   - Orientation: -1.1604
   - Velocity: 5.5589 m/s
   - Also in the same lanelet (381.0), but at a relatively safe lateral and longitudinal distance. The velocity and position donâ€™t indicate an immediate threat of collision.

### Calculations and Assessment:
- **Obstacle 30206.0**: Safe separation on the roadway indicates **negligible risk**.
- **Obstacle 30209.0**: They are in the same lanelet with decreasing distance, justifying **close monitoring** for high risk (score 2).
- **Obstacle 30210.0**: Similarly spaced and safe, indicating **minimal risk** under current trends.

### JSON Output:
```json
{
    "CollisionObstacles": [],
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null,
    "HighRiskObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "30209.0",
        "OverallRiskScore": 2
    }
}
```

The analysis suggests that none of the obstacles pose an immediate extreme (1) or collision risk (0) but obstacle 30209.0 should be monitored closely due to its trajectory and shared lanelet with the ego vehicle, leading to its categorization as a high risk (score 2).
