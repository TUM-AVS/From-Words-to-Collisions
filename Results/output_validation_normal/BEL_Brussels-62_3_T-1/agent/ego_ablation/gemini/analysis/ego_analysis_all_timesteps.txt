At t=0.9s, Obstacle 30206 is in front of the ego vehicle, approaching longitudinally at -0.62 m/s with a distance of 8.20 m.  While there's no immediate collision, the closing velocity suggests a potential risk if the ego or obstacle continue their motion. There is exact lateral alignment between the ego vehicle and obstacle 30206, which could increase collision risk. This needs continued monitoring.

Obstacle 30209 is behind the ego, also with exact lateral alignment, at -9.19m and nearly stationary relative to the ego (0.05 m/s closing velocity). This poses less of a risk, although the proximity and alignment should still be tracked.

Obstacle 30210 is far behind the ego (-24.76 m) and moving away. It presents no immediate risk.

Based on the provided context, the most critical obstacle is 30206 due to its proximity, closing velocity, and exact lateral alignment with the ego vehicle. It does not reach the level of Extreme risk due to sufficient distance to react.
