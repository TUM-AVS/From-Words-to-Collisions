### Safety analysis for timestep 0.9s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

**- Obstacle ID: 30206**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is in front of the ego vehicle with a longitudinal distance of 8.20m and a lateral distance of 8.20m.  It's approaching the ego vehicle longitudinally (-0.62 m/s). Lateral movement is minimal. The distance is moderately safe but requires monitoring.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: The closing longitudinal velocity suggests a potential collision if the current trend continues.  Lateral movement is minimal.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3

**- Obstacle ID: 30209**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is behind the ego vehicle with a longitudinal distance of -9.19m and a lateral distance of -9.19m. The longitudinal velocity is small (0.05m/s), and lateral velocity is minimal. Poses no immediate threat.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason:  Low closing longitudinal velocity and minimal lateral movement indicate low risk.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

**- Obstacle ID: 30210**
- Distance Risk reason:  Obstacle is behind the ego vehicle with a longitudinal distance of -24.76m and a lateral distance of -24.76m, and moving away from the ego vehicle.  No risk.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: The obstacle is moving away longitudinally, indicating no collision risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5
