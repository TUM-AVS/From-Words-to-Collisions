Obstacle 30206:
- Trajectory: This obstacle has been consistently in front of the ego vehicle and approaching longitudinally, with a lateral distance of 0.00m throughout all timesteps.  The longitudinal distance decreases from 8.69m to 8.20m over the 0.9 seconds.
- TTC: Longitudinal TTC at t=0.9s is 8.20m / 0.62m/s ≈ 13.2s. Lateral movement is negligible.
- MDC: Given the constant lateral alignment and the decreasing longitudinal distance, the MDC is essentially the longitudinal distance of 8.20m.
- Risk: Low Risk (4) due to the MDC.

Obstacle 30209:
- Trajectory: This obstacle has been consistently behind the ego vehicle, initially approaching, with a lateral distance of 0.00m.  The longitudinal distance decreased slightly from -9.50m to -9.19m in the first 0.8 seconds, then remained stable in the last 0.1 seconds. Its relative longitudinal velocity has dropped significantly in the last timestep, indicating it is no longer rapidly approaching.
- TTC: Longitudinal TTC at t=0.9s is 9.19m/0.05m/s ≈ 183.8s. Lateral movement is negligible.
- MDC: Since this obstacle is approaching from behind, MDC is approximately longitudinal distance of 9.19m.
- Risk: Negligible Risk (5) due to the large TTC and MDC.

Obstacle 30210:
- Trajectory: This obstacle remains far behind the ego vehicle throughout and is generally moving away longitudinally, with the distance increasing slightly in the later timesteps and a near-constant 0 lateral distance.
- TTC: The TTC isn't meaningful here as the relative longitudinal velocity is negative (moving away), and it maintains a steady lateral distance.
- MDC: With the obstacle moving further away, MDC is roughly the longitudinal distance, which is around 24.76m.
- Risk: Negligible Risk (5).
