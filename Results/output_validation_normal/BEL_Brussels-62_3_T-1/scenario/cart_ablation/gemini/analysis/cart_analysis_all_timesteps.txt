At t=0.9s, Ego is in lanelet 381.0 at (-79.95, 170.88).

Obstacle 30206.0 is in a different lanelet (1506.0) and poses no immediate risk despite its proximity in terms of raw distance.

Obstacle 30209.0 is in the same lanelet as Ego at (-85.39, 183.45). While it's ahead of the Ego, it's significantly further north and the trajectories don't suggest an immediate collision risk.  Its velocity is decreasing, further reducing risk.

Obstacle 30210.0 is in the same lanelet as Ego at (-91.60, 197.73).  It's further ahead and north of Ego, similar to 30209.0, posing no immediate collision risk.

Therefore, no obstacles present a collision or extreme risk at t=0.9s.
