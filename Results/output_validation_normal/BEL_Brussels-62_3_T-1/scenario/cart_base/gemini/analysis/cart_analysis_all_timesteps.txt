At t=0.9s, Ego is in lanelet 381.0 at (-79.95, 170.88).

Obstacle 30206.0 is in lanelet 1506.0 at (-74.83, 159.25). While somewhat close, it's in a different lanelet, suggesting a separation by road markings or physical barriers.  Given the current positions and assuming typical lane widths, a collision is unlikely. This obstacle poses a low risk.

Obstacle 30209.0 is in the same lanelet as Ego (381.0) at (-85.39, 183.45).  It's ahead of the ego vehicle and to its left, with a significant lateral offset. Although in the same lane, the current trajectories do not suggest an immediate collision risk.  This obstacle is a medium risk.

Obstacle 30210.0 is also in lanelet 381.0 at (-91.60, 197.73).  It's significantly ahead of Ego and further left than Obstacle 30209.0.  The trajectory data doesn't indicate an immediate collision risk. This obstacle is a low to medium risk.
