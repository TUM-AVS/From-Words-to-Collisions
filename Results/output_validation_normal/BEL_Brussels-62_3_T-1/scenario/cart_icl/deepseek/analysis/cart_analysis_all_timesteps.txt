### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep:

### Obstacle Analysis:
1. **Obstacle ID: 30206.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Located in lanelet 1506.0, which is different from ego's lanelet (381.0). The obstacle is moving away from the ego vehicle over time.
   - **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: Relative velocity is low, and the obstacle is not on a collision path.
   - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)

2. **Obstacle ID: 30209.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Located in the same lanelet as ego (381.0). The obstacle is ahead of the ego vehicle but decelerating and maintaining a safe distance.
   - **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: Relative velocity is low, and the obstacle is decelerating.
   - **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low Risk)

3. **Obstacle ID: 30210.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Located in the same lanelet as ego (381.0). The obstacle is ahead of the ego vehicle but maintaining a safe distance.
   - **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: Relative velocity is low, and the obstacle is not accelerating significantly toward the ego.
   - **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low Risk)

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. **Obstacle 30206.0**: Not in the same lanelet and moving away. No collision risk.
2. **Obstacle 30209.0**: In the same lanelet but decelerating and maintaining distance. Low risk.
3. **Obstacle 30210.0**: In the same lanelet but maintaining distance. Low risk.
4. **Conclusion**: No immediate collision risk. All obstacles are either moving away or maintaining safe distances.
