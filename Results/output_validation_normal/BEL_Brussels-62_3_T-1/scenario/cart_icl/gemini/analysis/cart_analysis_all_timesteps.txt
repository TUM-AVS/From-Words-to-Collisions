### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
The ego vehicle is moving along lanelet 381. Obstacles 30209, 30210, 30211, and 30212 are also in the same lanelet but sufficiently far ahead, posing no immediate collision risk. Other obstacles are in different lanelets and exhibit safe separation distances and velocities. No obstacle poses an immediate collision risk.
