### Obstacle Analysis:

#### Obstacle ID: 30204
- **Distance Risk reason:** Obstacle 30204 is not on a direct collision course and is located approximately 20 units away in a different lanelet, gradually moving away as indicated by a consistent trajectory away from the ego vehicle.
- **Distance safety score:** 5
- **Time Risk reason:** The obstacle shows stable velocity and slight acceleration changes over the timesteps, moving parallel but not towards the ego vehicle.
- **Time safety score:** 5
- **Overall Risk score:** 5

#### Obstacle ID: 30205
- **Distance Risk reason:** Positioned far from the ego vehicle with a consistent trajectory and no significant approach observed.
- **Distance safety score:** 5
- **Time Risk reason:** Velocity and acceleration indicate negligible risk; movement is consistent and away from ego vehicle.
- **Time safety score:** 5
- **Overall Risk score:** 5

#### Obstacle ID: 30206
- **Distance Risk reason:** Obstacle 30206 is moving parallel to the ego in a different lanelet, maintaining a safe distance.
- **Distance safety score:** 5
- **Time Risk reason:** It shows stable movement with no sudden acceleration trends toward the ego vehicle.
- **Time safety score:** 5
- **Overall Risk score:** 5

#### Obstacle ID: 30207
- **Distance Risk reason:** Maintaining a significant distance from the ego vehicle, obstacle trajectory is mostly consistent aside from small fluctuations.
- **Distance safety score:** 5
- **Time Risk reason:** Stable velocity and small changes in acceleration reduce collision risk; not moving towards the ego vehicle.
- **Time safety score:** 5
- **Overall Risk score:** 5

#### Obstacle ID: 30209
- **Distance Risk reason:** Positioned in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle but moving away slightly; the trajectory does not currently intersect with the ego's path.
- **Distance safety score:** 4
- **Time Risk reason:** Though in the same lanelet, the velocity differences reduce immediate collision risk; acceleration variations aren't leading to a path towards the ego vehicle.
- **Time safety score:** 4
- **Overall Risk score:** 4

#### Obstacle ID: 30210
- **Distance Risk reason:** Shares the lanelet with the ego vehicle but maintains a consistent distance slightly ahead.
- **Distance safety score:** 4
- **Time Risk reason:** Maintaining relatively uniform velocity; acceleration changes do not suggest closing the gap quickly.
- **Time safety score:** 4
- **Overall Risk score:** 4

#### Obstacle ID: 30211
- **Distance Risk reason:** Positioned further ahead in the same lanelet, the distance remains sufficient to not present a collision risk.
- **Distance safety score:** 4
- **Time Risk reason:** Stability in velocity and small negative acceleration indicate no closing speed.
- **Time safety score:** 4
- **Overall Risk score:** 4

#### Obstacle ID: 30212
- **Distance Risk reason:** Ahead in the same lanelet, but trajectory leads further ahead, maintaining separation from the ego vehicle.
- **Distance safety score:** 4
- **Time Risk reason:** Going away faster; velocity suggests increasing separation over time.
- **Time safety score:** 4
- **Overall Risk score:** 4

#### Obstacle ID: 30213
- **Distance Risk reason:** Positioned in a different lanelet and maintaining a trajectory away from the ego vehicle.
- **Distance safety score:** 5
- **Time Risk reason:** Continuous stable velocity, no approach towards the ego vehicle trajectory.
- **Time safety score:** 5
- **Overall Risk score:** 5

#### Obstacle ID: 30214
- **Distance Risk reason:** Far positioning and consistent trajectory ensure no collision course with ego vehicle.
- **Distance safety score:** 5
- **Time Risk reason:** Obstacle shows negligible time-dependent threat; enjoying stable movement and position.
- **Time safety score:** 5
- **Overall Risk score:** 5

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
This scenario is not classified as either a collision scenario or an extreme-risk scenario. All obstacles show either stable or increasing separation from the ego vehicle with no significant threats observed.
