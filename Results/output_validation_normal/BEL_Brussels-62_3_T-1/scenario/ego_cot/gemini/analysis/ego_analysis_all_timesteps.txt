### Safety analysis for timestep 0.9 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

**Assumptions and Clarifications:**

* The prompt mentions "adjusted distances" (adjusted_d_long, adjusted_d_lat), but these values are not provided in the scenario context. Therefore, the analysis will be based on the provided "real distance" (DTClong, DTClat) values.
* TTC calculations are simplified due to the lack of clear ego vehicle motion information. We'll primarily focus on relative velocities and distances.  A proper TTC calculation requires the absolute velocities of both ego and obstacle.
*  Since we're dealing with diagonal distances, we calculate "effective distance" as the minimum of |DTClong| and |DTClat| to approximate how close the obstacle is from the ego car in either dimension.
* Lateral motion and exact alignment are unclear ("Exact lateral alignment or unknown case"). We will assume the obstacles are approximately aligned with the ego's direction of travel (though not perfectly) in the first two cases, since they are not described as being primarily to the sides. The lateral velocities and accelerations are also close to zero in these cases.

### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 30206**
- Distance Risk reason:  Obstacle is in front and approaching the ego vehicle longitudinally (8.20m). The lateral distance is also 8.20m, so the effective distance is 8.20m and decreasing.
- Distance safety score: 2 (High Risk)
- Time Risk reason: Obstacle is moving towards the ego with a negative longitudinal relative velocity (-0.62 m/s).  This indicates a high risk of collision if the ego vehicle does not react.
- Time safety score: 2 (High Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 2 (High Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 30209**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is behind the ego vehicle but relatively close (-9.19m longitudinally and laterally). The effective distance is 9.19m. While behind, the small distance and relative velocity indicate a potential hazard.
- Distance safety score: 3 (Medium Risk)
- Time Risk reason: Although behind, this obstacle has a low positive longitudinal relative velocity (0.05 m/s), suggesting it is almost stationary relative to the ego vehicle.  The situation is less immediately dangerous than 30206 but still requires monitoring.
- Time safety score: 3 (Medium Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 3 (Medium Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 30210**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is behind and moving away from the ego vehicle (-24.76m longitudinally and laterally). Effective distance is large.
- Distance safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- Time Risk reason: The negative relative longitudinal velocity (-0.13 m/s) confirms that it is moving further away from the ego vehicle.
- Time safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 5 (Negligible Risk)

```json
{
    "CollisionObstacle": null,
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "30206",
        "OverallRiskScore": "2"
    },
    "IsCollisionScenario": false,
    "Justification": "Obstacle 30206 poses a high risk due to its proximity (8.2m) in front of the ego vehicle and negative relative longitudinal velocity (-0.62m/s), suggesting an impending collision if no action is taken. While not an immediate collision, it represents an extreme risk."
