### Obstacle-by-Obstacle Analysis (Most Recent Timestep: 0.9s)

#### **Obstacle 30206 (Front of ego car)**
- **Adjusted Distance**: Longitudinal 8.20 m, Lateral 0.00 m  
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal -0.62 m/s (approaching), Lateral -0.00 m/s (stable)  
- **Motion**: Driving toward ego longitudinally with exact lateral alignment.  

**Risk Assessment**:
1. **MDC (Minimum Distance to Collision)**:  
   - Lateral distance = 0.00 m (aligned), but no lateral movement (lateral velocity ≈ 0 m/s).  
   - Longitudinal distance decreasing at 0.62 m/s.  
   - MDC is effectively the longitudinal distance (8.20 m), which is > 5.0 m → **No Risk (5)**.  

2. **TTC (Time-to-Collision)**:  
   - TTC = Longitudinal distance / |Relative Velocity| = 8.20 / 0.62 ≈ 13.23 seconds.  
   - TTC > 5.0 seconds → **No Risk (5)**.  

3. **Overall Risk**:  
   - Both MDC and TTC indicate **No Risk (5)**.  

#### **Obstacle 30209 (Behind ego car)**
- **Adjusted Distance**: Longitudinal -9.19 m (behind), Lateral 0.00 m  
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal 0.05 m/s (approaching slowly), Lateral -0.02 m/s (negligible)  
- **Motion**: Driving toward ego from behind with exact lateral alignment.  

**Risk Assessment**:
1. **MDC**:  
   - Lateral distance = 0.00 m (aligned), but lateral velocity is negligible.  
   - Longitudinal distance decreasing at 0.05 m/s (very slow).  
   - MDC is effectively the longitudinal distance (9.19 m), which is > 5.0 m → **No Risk (5)**.  

2. **TTC**:  
   - TTC = 9.19 / 0.05 ≈ 183.8 seconds (very large).  
   - TTC > 5.0 seconds → **No Risk (5)**.  

3. **Overall Risk**:  
   - Both MDC and TTC indicate **No Risk (5)**.  

#### **Obstacle 30210 (Behind ego car)**
- **Adjusted Distance**: Longitudinal -24.76 m (behind), Lateral 0.00 m  
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal -0.13 m/s (moving away), Lateral -0.02 m/s (negligible)  
- **Motion**: Moving away longitudinally with exact lateral alignment.  

**Risk Assessment**:
1. **MDC**:  
   - Lateral distance = 0.00 m (aligned), but no lateral movement.  
   - Longitudinal distance increasing (moving away).  
   - MDC is effectively the longitudinal distance (24.76 m), which is > 5.0 m → **No Risk (5)**.  

2. **TTC**:  
   - Negative relative velocity (moving away) → TTC not applicable for collision.  
   - **No Risk (5)**.  

3. **Overall Risk**:  
   - Both MDC and TTC indicate **No Risk (5)**.

### Trajectory Analysis Across Timesteps
- **Obstacle 30206**: Consistently approaching longitudinally at ~0.6 m/s, but distance remains large (>8 m). Lateral alignment is stable.  
- **Obstacle 30209**: Initially approaching at ~0.5 m/s, but velocity drops to 0.05 m/s by 0.9s (minimal risk).  
- **Obstacle 30210**: Consistently moving away from ego (no risk).

### Collision Scenario Determination
- **No obstacles** have a risk score of 0 (collision) or 1 (extreme risk).  
- All obstacles are at **No Risk (5)** due to large distances and low/no closing velocities.
