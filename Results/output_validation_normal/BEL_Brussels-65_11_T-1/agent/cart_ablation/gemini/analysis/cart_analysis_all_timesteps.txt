Obstacle 30220 is in the same lanelet (87.0) as the ego vehicle and its position at t=0.9s (404.3589, 246.9738) is very close to the ego vehicle's position (393.2909, 233.1738).  Additionally, obstacle 30220's velocity and acceleration show it's moving faster than the ego vehicle, indicating a potential for collision if these trends continue.  Further analysis would be needed to determine exact TTC and calculate a precise risk score, but this initial observation suggests a high risk.
