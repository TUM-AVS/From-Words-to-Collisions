Obstacle 30220 is in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle and its position is consistently close to the ego vehicle.  Over multiple timesteps, the y-coordinate difference between ego and obstacle 30220 remains around 10-12, while the x-coordinate difference fluctuates but generally decreases slightly.  This indicates a potential collision risk.  Additionally, obstacle 30220's acceleration varies considerably, making its future trajectory less predictable.

While other obstacles are present, they are in different lanelets and/or their trajectories don't present an immediate collision threat based on the provided data.  Further analysis with additional timesteps might be needed to fully assess their risk.
