At t=0.9s, the ego vehicle (ID 30221) is at (393.29, 233.17) with a velocity of 5.25 m/s.  Let's analyze the risk posed by each obstacle:

* **Obstacle 30209:** Located at (398.63, 245.35), this obstacle is in a different lanelet (86) than the ego vehicle (87).  While its y-coordinate suggests it's slightly ahead, the difference isn't substantial enough to cause concern given the lateral separation.  Risk: **Low (4)**.

* **Obstacle 30214:**  At (377.90, 221.73) and in lanelet 1313. The significant lateral distance and different lanelet imply minimal risk.  Risk: **Negligible (5)**.

* **Obstacle 30219:** Positioned at (369.38, 235.55) in lanelet 1310.  This obstacle is relatively far from the ego vehicle and poses no immediate threat. Risk: **Negligible (5)**.

* **Obstacle 30220:** This obstacle, at (404.36, 246.97), is in the same lanelet (87) as the ego vehicle and significantly ahead.  It is moving faster than the ego vehicle (7.86 m/s vs 5.25 m/s), increasing the distance between them. Risk: **Low (4)**.

* **Obstacle 30223:**  Located at (385.86, 223.76), this obstacle is in lanelet 1476. Due to sufficient lateral distance, there is minimal risk. Risk: **Negligible (5).**

* **Obstacle 30227:**  At (379.50, 216.02), this obstacle is also in lanelet 1476.  The lateral and longitudinal distances suggest no immediate risk. Risk: **Negligible (5).**

No obstacles pose an immediate collision risk.
