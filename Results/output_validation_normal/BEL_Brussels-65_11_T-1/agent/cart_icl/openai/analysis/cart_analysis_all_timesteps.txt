In the provided scenario, we need to analyze the potential collision risks based on the most recent time step (0.9 seconds) while considering the overall motion trends from earlier data points. We'll focus on the relative positions, velocities, and acceleration trends of each obstacle relative to the ego vehicle and evaluate based on TTC (Time to Collision) and MDC (Minimum Distance to Collision).

### Analysis of Obstacles:

1. **Obstacle 30209**:
    - Current position is significantly ahead of the ego vehicle.
    - Velocity is similar, leading to a very low closing rate.
    - There's no immediate risk from this obstacle as it is advancing further away.
    - **Risk**: Negligible (5)

2. **Obstacle 30214**:
    - Positioned farther behind and traveling in a separate lane that does not intersect with the ego vehicle's trajectory.
    - The obstacle is moving at a faster pace but in a diverging direction.
    - **Risk**: Negligible (5)

3. **Obstacle 30219**:
    - Positioned behind and to the side of the ego vehicle, gradually overtaking but with decent lateral separation.
    - Velocity direction aids in diverging rather than converging.
    - **Risk**: Negligible (5)

4. **Obstacle 30220**:
    - Located significantly ahead of the ego vehicle, within the same lane.
    - Moving faster with a positive acceleration, increasing separation.
    - No immediate collision risk detected from its trajectory.
    - **Risk**: Negligible (5)

5. **Obstacle 30223**:
    - Further behind the ego vehicle and in a different lane.
    - The velocity difference does not suggest any impending convergence with the ego vehicle's path.
    - **Risk**: Negligible (5)
 
6. **Obstacle 30227**:
    - Farther behind the ego vehicle and the current velocity places it on a divergent path with steady acceleration.
    - Positioned in an entirely different lane, reducing collision potential.
    - **Risk**: Negligible (5) 

Additionally, no obstacles were rated as collision or extreme risk based on positional and velocity evaluations. As such, all obstacles present negligible risk with substantial separation either longitudinally or laterally, and are on trajectories that do not suggest an impending collision with the ego vehicle. Thereby, no further impact avoidance maneuvers are required beyond planned operations.

### Output in JSON Format:

```json
{
    "CollisionObstacles": [
    ],
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {
    },
    "HighRiskObstacle": {
    }
}
```

This output indicates no obstacles currently present collision or extreme collision risks within this scenario as all entities are maintaining or increasing healthy distance margins relative to the ego vehicle.
