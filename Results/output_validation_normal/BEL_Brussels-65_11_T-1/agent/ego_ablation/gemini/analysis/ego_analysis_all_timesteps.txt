At the most recent timestep (0.9 seconds), obstacle 30209 is the closest to the ego vehicle laterally and longitudinally.  It is located at 8.25m longitudinally and 2.15m laterally in the front-left zone. Although it is moving away laterally, it is approaching longitudinally at a slow velocity (-0.03 m/s) but a relatively high acceleration (1.06 m/sÂ²). This warrants close monitoring but it is not yet in the collision or extreme risk category. No other obstacles present immediate concern. All other obstacles are moving away from the ego vehicle longitudinally and are at safe lateral distances.
