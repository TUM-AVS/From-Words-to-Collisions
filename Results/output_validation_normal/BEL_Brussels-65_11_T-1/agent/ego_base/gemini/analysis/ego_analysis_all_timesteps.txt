Obstacle 30209 is in the Front-left, at a longitudinal distance of 8.25m and a lateral distance of 2.15m. It is moving slightly towards the ego vehicle longitudinally (-0.03 m/s) and away laterally (0.17 m/s). The positive lateral velocity indicates the obstacle might be slightly turning away from the ego vehicle, lessening the risk of a lateral collision. Given the distances and velocities, this obstacle presents a low risk (4).

Obstacle 30214 is in the Rear-left, moving away longitudinally at -11.30 m/s.  The lateral distance is 2.80m and the lateral velocity is -3.61 m/s, meaning it's moving closer to the ego vehicle laterally. However, given the significant longitudinal distance and velocity showing the obstacle is quickly moving away from the ego car, the overall risk is low (4).

Obstacle 30219 is in the Rear-left, approaching the ego vehicle from behind (3.70 m/s) and laterally (-1.26 m/s).  While closing in from behind, it's still at a longitudinal distance of -9.07 m and a lateral distance of 18.21 m. It's unlikely to collide in the immediate future. This represents a medium risk (3).

Obstacle 30220 is in the Front and moving away longitudinally (2.60 m/s) at a distance of 13.18m. There's no immediate risk (5).

Obstacle 30223 is Behind the ego vehicle and moving away at -0.52 m/s with a longitudinal distance of -7.48m.  No immediate risk (5).

Obstacle 30227 is Behind the ego vehicle and moving away at -1.81 m/s with a longitudinal distance of -17.49m. No immediate risk (5).
