### Safety analysis for timestep 0.9s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

It's important to note that we are missing crucial information for accurate TTC and MDC calculation.  We need the ego vehicle's dimensions and speed.  The provided "real distance" values seem to be Euclidean distances which are not directly useful for collision assessment in longitudinal and lateral directions separately.  Because of this lack of key data, the following analysis provides estimations and assumptions, emphasizing the need for complete data in a real-world application.

**Assumptions:**

* **Ego Vehicle Size:** We'll assume a typical vehicle length of 4.5 meters and width of 2 meters for illustrative purposes.
* **"Real Distance" Interpretation:** We'll interpret "real distance" as Euclidean distance and decompose it into longitudinal and lateral components based on the relative directions provided. This is an approximation, and accurate vehicle position and heading are needed for precise calculations.


### Obstacle Analysis:

**- Obstacle ID: 30209**
- Distance Risk reason:  Located front-left at approximately 8.25m Euclidean distance.  Given the relative velocity, lateral movement appears minimal, but some longitudinal risk remains due to negative longitudinal velocity.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason:  TTC cannot be accurately computed without ego speed and precise longitudinal/lateral distances. Approximating TTC based on current values suggests a moderate risk due to the negative longitudinal velocity.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3

**- Obstacle ID: 30214**
- Distance Risk reason: Located rear-left and moving away from the ego vehicle.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Moving away from the ego vehicle.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

**- Obstacle ID: 30219**
- Distance Risk reason:  Located rear-left, but closing in longitudinally. The lateral distance is significant, and lateral motion is towards the ego vehicle.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: TTC calculation is hampered by lack of data, but positive longitudinal velocity suggests decreasing longitudinal distance.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3


**- Obstacle ID: 30220**
- Distance Risk reason: Located in front and moving away from the ego vehicle.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Moving away from the ego vehicle.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

**- Obstacle ID: 30223**
- Distance Risk reason: Located behind and moving away from the ego vehicle.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Moving away from the ego vehicle.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

**- Obstacle ID: 30227**
- Distance Risk reason: Located behind and moving away from the ego vehicle.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Moving away from the ego vehicle.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5
