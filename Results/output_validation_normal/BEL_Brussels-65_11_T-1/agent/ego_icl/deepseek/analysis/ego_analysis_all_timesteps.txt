Let me analyze each obstacle at the most recent timestep (0.9 seconds) with trajectory context:

1. Obstacle 30209 (Front-left):
- Adjusted distances: longitudinal 8.25m, lateral 2.15m
- Relative velocities: longitudinal -0.03 m/s (slow approach), lateral 0.17 m/s (moving away)
- MDC: Lateral distance is increasing (2.15m), longitudinal distance stable
- TTC: Not applicable (moving away laterally, very slow longitudinal approach)
- Risk: 5 (Negligible) - No convergence in either dimension

2. Obstacle 30214 (Rear-left):
- Adjusted distances: longitudinal -14.16m (behind), lateral 2.80m
- Relative velocities: longitudinal -11.30 m/s (moving away quickly), lateral -3.61 m/s (approaching)
- MDC: Lateral distance decreasing but still 2.80m
- TTC (lateral): 2.80/3.61 = 0.78 seconds
- Risk: 2 (High) due to lateral TTC <1.0s, but longitudinal separation increasing

3. Obstacle 30219 (Rear-left):
- Adjusted distances: longitudinal -9.07m, lateral 18.21m
- Relative velocities: longitudinal 3.70 m/s (approaching from behind), lateral -1.26 m/s (approaching)
- MDC: Both distances large (>9m longitudinal, >18m lateral)
- TTC: Not meaningful due to large distances
- Risk: 5 (Negligible) - Despite approaching, distances are very large

4. Obstacle 30220 (Front):
- Adjusted distances: longitudinal 13.18m, lateral 0.00m
- Relative velocities: longitudinal 2.60 m/s (moving away), lateral 0.26 m/s
- MDC: 13.18m longitudinal, moving away
- TTC: Not applicable
- Risk: 5 (Negligible) - Moving away in both dimensions

5. Obstacle 30223 (Behind):
- Adjusted distances: longitudinal -7.48m, lateral 0.00m
- Relative velocities: longitudinal -0.52 m/s (moving away), lateral 0.06 m/s
- MDC: 7.48m longitudinal, moving away
- TTC: Not applicable
- Risk: 5 (Negligible) - Moving away in both dimensions

6. Obstacle 30227 (Behind):
- Adjusted distances: longitudinal -17.49m, lateral 0.00m
- Relative velocities: longitudinal -1.81 m/s (moving away), lateral 0.04 m/s
- MDC: 17.49m longitudinal, moving away
- TTC: Not applicable
- Risk: 5 (Negligible) - Moving away in both dimensions

Trajectory Analysis:
- Only Obstacle 30214 shows concerning behavior with lateral TTC <1s
- All other obstacles either moving away or at safe distances
- No actual collisions (distance >0 in all relevant dimensions)
