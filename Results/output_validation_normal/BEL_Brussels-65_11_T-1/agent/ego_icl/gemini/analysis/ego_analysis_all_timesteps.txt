Obstacle 30209: Located front-left, with longitudinal distance of 8.25m and lateral distance of 2.15m.  Across the timesteps, the longitudinal distance initially decreases slightly, then increases. The lateral distance consistently increases. The relative longitudinal velocity is -0.03 m/s (slightly moving away) and the lateral velocity is 0.17 m/s (moving away).  Given the increasing distances and separating velocities, the risk is low.
    * TTClongitudinal: Not applicable due to separating velocity
    * TTC Lateral: 2.15m / 0.17m/s = 12.65s
    * MDC: Approx. 2.15m (using the smaller of the two distances as a proxy since both are moving away)
    * Risk Score: 4 (Low Risk)

Obstacle 30214: Located rear-left, with longitudinal distance of -14.16m and lateral distance of 2.80m.  Across the timesteps, both longitudinal and lateral distances are increasing (moving away). The relative longitudinal velocity is -11.30 m/s (moving away) and the lateral velocity is -3.61 m/s (moving toward the ego car).
    * TTClongitudinal: Not applicable due to separating velocity
    * TTC Lateral: 2.80m / 3.61 m/s = 0.78s
    * MDC: Approx. 2.80m
    * Risk Score: 2 (High Risk)

Obstacle 30219: Located rear-left, with longitudinal distance of -9.07m and lateral distance of 18.21m. Across the timesteps, the longitudinal distance initially increases then decreases. The lateral distance consistently decreases. The relative longitudinal velocity is 3.70 m/s (approaching) and the lateral velocity is -1.26 m/s (moving toward).
    * TTClongitudinal: 9.07m / 3.70 m/s = 2.45s
    * TTC Lateral: 18.21m / 1.26 m/s = 14.45s
    * MDC: Approx. 9.07m
    * Risk Score: 3 (Medium Risk due to TTC Longitudinal and closing)


Obstacle 30220: Located in front, with longitudinal distance of 13.18m and lateral distance of 0.00m. Across the timesteps, the longitudinal distance is increasing. The lateral distance remains at 0.  The relative longitudinal velocity is 2.60 m/s (moving away) and the lateral velocity is 0.26 m/s (moving away).
    * TTClongitudinal: Not applicable due to separating velocity
    * TTC Lateral: Not applicable as lateral distance is 0 and velocity is separating
    * MDC: Approx. 13.18m
    * Risk Score: 5 (Negligible Risk)


Obstacle 30223: Located behind, with longitudinal distance of -7.48m and lateral distance of 0.00m. Across the timesteps, the longitudinal distance increases (moving away). The lateral distance remains at 0.00m. The relative longitudinal velocity is -0.52 m/s (moving away) and the lateral velocity is 0.06 m/s.
    * TTClongitudinal: Not applicable due to separating velocity
    * TTC Lateral: Not applicable as lateral distance is 0 and velocity is separating
    * MDC: Approx. 7.48m
    * Risk Score: 5 (Negligible Risk)

Obstacle 30227: Located behind, with longitudinal distance of -17.49m and lateral distance of 0.00m.  Across the timesteps, the longitudinal distance increases (moving away). The lateral distance remains at 0.  The relative longitudinal velocity is -1.81 m/s (moving away) and the lateral velocity is 0.04 m/s.
    * TTClongitudinal: Not applicable due to separating velocity
    * TTC Lateral: Not applicable as lateral distance is 0 and velocity is separating
    * MDC: Approx. 17.49m.
    * Risk Score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
