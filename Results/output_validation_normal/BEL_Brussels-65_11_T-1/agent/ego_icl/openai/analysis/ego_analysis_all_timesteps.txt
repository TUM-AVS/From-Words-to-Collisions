### Obstacle Analysis

**Obstacle 30209:**
- **Position:** Front-left of the ego car
- **Adjusted Distances:** Longitudinal 8.25 m, Lateral 2.15 m
- **Relative Velocity:** Longitudinal -0.03 m/s, Lateral 0.17 m/s
- **Trajectory:** Approaching longitudinally and moving away laterally
- **TTC Calculation:**
  - Longitudinal distance is stable around 8.2 meters, relative velocity is near zero; hence, - no collision imminent longitudinally as the relative motion is not significantly converging.
  - Lateral distance is increasing (moving away laterally), indicating no immediate collision risk.
- **MDC Calculation:**
  - Minimum distance in the diagonal approach; both distances are not critical.
- **Risk Assessment:** With lateral distance increasing and stable longitudinal motions, this obstacle poses negligible risk. Therefore, risk score: **5** (Negligible Risk).

**Obstacle 30214:**
- **Position:** Rear-left of the ego car
- **Adjusted Distances:** Longitudinal -14.16 m, Lateral 2.80 m
- **Relative Velocity:** Longitudinal -11.30 m/s, Lateral -3.61 m/s
- **Trajectory:** Moving away longitudinally, approaching laterally
- **TTC Calculation:**
  - Longitudinal motion is largely away with high velocity, no collision risk.
  - Lateral motion indicates potential closing from left, but distances suggest collision is not imminent at greater than 3 meters lateral separation.
- **MDC Calculation:**
  - Lateral distance important here; convergence detected, but distance remains > 1.0 meter.
- **Risk Assessment:** Lateral approach leads to a low but present risk, making risk score: **4** (Low Risk).

**Obstacle 30219:**
- **Position:** Rear-left of the ego car
- **Adjusted Distances:** Longitudinal -9.07 m, Lateral 18.21 m
- **Relative Velocity:** Longitudinal 3.70 m/s, Lateral -1.26 m/s
- **Trajectory:** Approaching from behind longitudinally; no immediate concerns laterally.
- **TTC Calculation:**
  - Longitudinally appears to approach, but at a substantial distance (> 9m), no immediate threat.
- **MDC Calculation:**
  - Longitudinal and lateral measures far exceed 5m.
- **Risk Assessment:** Given stable lateral distances and longitudinal separation, negligible immediate risk leads to score: **5** (Negligible Risk).

**Obstacle 30220:**
- **Position:** Front of the ego car
- **Adjusted Distances:** Longitudinal 13.18 m, Lateral 0.00 m
- **Relative Velocity:** Longitudinal 2.60 m/s, Lateral 0.26 m/s
- **Trajectory:** Moving away longitudinally
- **TTC Calculation:**
  - Increasing distance, trajectory clearly diverging.
- **MDC Calculation:**
  - Complete separation ensures no collision scenario.
- **Risk Assessment:** Clearly moving away, indicating no collision risk. Score: **5** (Negligible Risk).

**Obstacle 30223:**
- **Position:** Behind the ego car
- **Adjusted Distances:** Longitudinal -7.48 m, Lateral 0.00 m
- **Relative Velocity:** Longitudinal -0.52 m/s, Lateral 0.06 m/s
- **Trajectory:** Maintaining distance longitudinally
- **TTC Calculation:**
  - Moving away with stable vectors, interaction unlikely.
- **MDC Calculation:**
  - Consistent longitudinal and lateral measurements favorable.
- **Risk Assessment:** No significant change means negligible risk, resulting in score: **5** (Negligible Risk).

**Obstacle 30227:**
- **Position:** Behind the ego car
- **Adjusted Distances:** Longitudinal -17.49 m, Lateral 0.00 m
- **Relative Velocity:** Longitudinal -1.81 m/s, Lateral 0.04 m/s
- **Trajectory:** Moving further away
- **TTC Calculation:**
  - Consistent widening distances; not approaching.
- **MDC Calculation:**
  - Well beyond any risk thresholds longitudinally or laterally 
- **Risk Assessment:** Safe separation from the ego vehicle results in score: **5** (Negligible Risk).

### Conclusion:
All obstacles are assessed as either having negligible or low risk due to substantial separation, stating any necessary movement away from the ego vehicle trajectory. Therefore, no obstacles possess immediate high risk or incite a collision probability in this context.
