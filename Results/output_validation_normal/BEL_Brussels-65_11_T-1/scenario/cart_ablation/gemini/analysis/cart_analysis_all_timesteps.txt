At t=0.9s, Ego (30221.0) is in lanelet 87.0 at (393.2909, 233.1738). Obstacle 30220.0 is also in lanelet 87.0 at (404.3589, 246.9738).  Obstacle 30220.0's x-coordinate is significantly ahead of the ego vehicle, but the y-coordinate difference (approximately 13.8 meters) suggests they are close enough laterally to be a potential concern given the ego vehicle's and obstacle's heading and lanelets. Previous timestamps show obstacle 30220.0 rapidly accelerating towards the ego vehicle from behind while generally staying within lanelet 87, indicating increasing risk of collision.  Though not an immediate collision, given the relative velocities and accelerations, this warrants an "Extreme Risk" assessment. No other obstacles present immediate collision risk at this timestep.

        "IsCollisionScenario": false,
        "Reasoning": "Obstacle 30220.0 poses an extreme risk due to its proximity, high speed, acceleration and shared lanelet with Ego. While not an immediate collision, the rapid approach from behind within the same lanelet makes a near-term collision likely without intervention."
