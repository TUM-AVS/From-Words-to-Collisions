At t=0.9s, Ego is in lanelet 87.0 at (393.29, 233.17).

Obstacle 30220 is also in lanelet 87.0 at (404.36, 246.97).  While the y-coordinate difference suggests some lateral separation, the x-coordinate difference is small and shrinking over the previous timesteps, with both Ego and Obstacle 30220 moving forward and Obstacle 30220 accelerating significantly.  This indicates a high risk of collision. The risk is scored as 1 (Extreme Risk) due to the closing distance, shared lanelet, and observed acceleration patterns.
