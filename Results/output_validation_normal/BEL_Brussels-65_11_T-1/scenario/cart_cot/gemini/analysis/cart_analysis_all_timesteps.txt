### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:

- Obstacle ID: 30209.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 30209.0 is in a different lanelet (86.0) than the ego vehicle (87.0).  While its Y-coordinate is approaching the ego vehicle's, its X-coordinate suggests a parallel trajectory with a safe lateral separation maintained throughout the provided timesteps. The historical data shows no indication of this obstacle merging or crossing into the ego vehicle's lane.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason:  The obstacle's velocity has fluctuated over the timesteps, but remains similar to the ego vehicle's velocity. The parallel trajectories and consistent lateral separation, observed over time, reduce the time-based risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 30214.0
- Distance Risk reason: This obstacle started in a different lanelet and its X and Y coordinates show it moving further away from the ego vehicle throughout the observed period.  The historical trajectory clearly indicates divergence.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: The velocity of this obstacle, although higher than the ego vehicle's, is not a concern due to its diverging trajectory and increasing spatial separation observed over time.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 30219.0
- Distance Risk reason:  This obstacle is significantly further away in both X and Y coordinates and the difference is increasing over time.  It presents no immediate spatial risk to the ego vehicle based on the observed history.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Although this obstacle has the highest velocity among the observed obstacles, the increasing distance over time and its trajectory away from the ego vehicle mitigate any time-related risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 30220.0
- Distance Risk reason: This obstacle is in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle (87.0) and ahead of it.  However, the distance between the two has remained relatively stable across all timestamps, with obstacle 30220 maintaining a safe longitudinal separation.  Its Y-coordinate suggests it's slightly offset within the lane.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: The obstacle’s velocity is initially slightly higher than the ego vehicle’s, but it fluctuates and doesn't drastically change the inter-vehicle distance.  The relatively consistent longitudinal separation over the observed period indicates a low time-based risk.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- Obstacle ID: 30223.0
- Distance Risk reason: This obstacle begins at a different Y coordinate and different lanelet, and moves further away in the Y direction over time, while slightly converging in the X direction.  The historical trajectory indicates increasing overall separation.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: While its velocity is lower than the ego's, the diverging trajectory negates any time-related collision risk.  The obstacle is consistently moving away, reinforcing the low risk assessment.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 30227.0
- Distance Risk reason:  This obstacle is located in a different lanelet and at a greater Y-coordinate, indicating lateral and longitudinal separation.  Over time, the separation further increases based on both X and Y coordinates.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: The obstacle's velocity is consistently lower than the ego vehicle's and its trajectory shows divergence.  This combination significantly reduces any time-based risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5


### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. **Most critical obstacles:** Obstacle 30220 is the most critical as it's in the same lanelet (87.0) as the ego vehicle and positioned ahead.
2. **Trajectory analysis:** Over the 10 timesteps, obstacle 30220 maintains its position ahead of the ego vehicle, with the longitudinal distance between them remaining relatively stable. Other obstacles show diverging trajectories or remain in separate lanelets.
3. **Relative position, velocities, and accelerations:**  While 30220 has a slightly fluctuating velocity, it doesn't significantly close the gap to the ego vehicle. The acceleration of both vehicles is also relatively small and doesn't drastically alter the situation.
4. **Collision determination:** Based on the provided data, no collision has occurred or is imminent. The consistent separation between the ego vehicle and all obstacles, especially 30220, suggests a safe scenario.
5. **Reasoning:** The observed trajectories, relative velocities, and consistent inter-vehicle distances over time all support the conclusion that this is not a collision scenario.
