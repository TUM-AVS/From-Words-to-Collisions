### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep:

### Obstacle Analysis:
1. **Obstacle ID: 30209.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Located in lanelet 86.0, adjacent to ego's lanelet (87.0). Distance is increasing over time (from ~5.6m to ~5.3m in the last timestep).
   - **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: Velocity is similar to ego (5.23 m/s vs 5.25 m/s), but trajectory is diverging.
   - **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low Risk)

2. **Obstacle ID: 30214.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Located in lanelet 1313.0, moving away from ego. Distance increased from ~13.6m to ~15.5m.
   - **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: Velocity (7.04 m/s) higher than ego, moving away.
   - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)

3. **Obstacle ID: 30219.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Located in lanelet 1310.0, moving away from ego. Distance increased from ~26.8m to ~23.9m.

   - **Time Risk reason**: High velocity (9.05 m/s) moving away.
   - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)

4. **Obstacle ID: 30220.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Located in the same lanelet (87.0) as ego, ahead by ~11.1m but distance is increasing (from ~10.4m to ~11.1m).
   - **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: Higher velocity (7.86 m/s) than ego, moving away.
   - **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low Risk)

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. **Lanelet Analysis**: Ego is in lanelet 87.0. Only obstacle 30220.0 is in the same lanelet but is ahead and moving away.
2. **Trajectory Analysis**: All obstacles are either moving away or maintaining safe distances.
3. **Velocity/Acceleration Trends**: No obstacles show converging trajectories or dangerous acceleration patterns.
4. **Collision Risk**: No immediate or near-term collision risk detected.
