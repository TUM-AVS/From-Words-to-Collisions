Obstacle 30209 is located at a longitudinal distance of 8.25m and a lateral distance of 2.15m relative to the ego vehicle, placing it in the front-left zone. Although its longitudinal velocity suggests it's slightly moving towards the ego vehicle (-0.03 m/s), the magnitude is very small.  Laterally, it's moving away from the ego vehicle (0.17 m/s). The overall risk associated with this obstacle appears low.

Obstacle 30214 is moving away longitudinally (-11.30 m/s) and laterally towards the ego vehicle (-3.61 m/s) from a longitudinal distance of -14.16m and lateral distance of 2.80m. The risk associated with this obstacle is negligible given its current trajectory and distance.

Obstacle 30219 is approaching the ego vehicle from behind with a longitudinal velocity of 3.70 m/s at a longitudinal distance of -9.07m. Laterally, it's positioned at 18.21m and moving towards the ego vehicle (-1.26 m/s). While the lateral movement needs monitoring, the longitudinal motion presents a low risk due to the distance.

Obstacle 30220, 30223 and 30227 are all moving away from the ego vehicle longitudinally and pose no immediate risk.
