At t=0.9s, Obstacle 30209 is in the front-left, approaching the ego car longitudinally (-0.03 m/s) and laterally (0.17 m/s) but at a distance of 8.25m longitudinal and 2.15m lateral. This obstacle does not pose an immediate collision risk. Obstacle 30214 is moving away longitudinally at high speed (-11.30 m/s) and approaching laterally (-3.61 m/s), posing no immediate risk. Obstacle 30219 is approaching from the rear-left (3.70 m/s longitudinally, -1.26 m/s laterally) but currently at a safe distance. Obstacles 30220, 30223, and 30227 are all moving away longitudinally and do not pose a risk.

Therefore, no obstacle poses an immediate collision risk in this timestep.
