### Safety analysis for timestep 0.9 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

It's important to note that the provided scenario description lacks crucial information for accurate TTC and MDC calculation.  We need the ego vehicle's speed and dimensions, as well as more precise information about obstacle dimensions and shapes. The "real distance" values are ambiguous without context of the ego vehicle's and obstacles' reference points.  Furthermore, diagonal movements (like front-left) need to be decomposed into proper longitudinal and lateral components relative to the ego vehicle's orientation.

Because of these missing elements, the following analysis will be *qualitative* based on the available information, focusing on relative motion trends and risk levels.  We will assume, for simplification, that "real distance" approximates MDC, acknowledging that this is a simplification.


### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 30209**
- Distance Risk reason: Located Front-Left, with a moderately close real distance (8.25m both longitudinally and laterally). While moving away laterally, it's slightly moving towards the ego longitudinally.
- Distance safety score: 3 (Medium Risk)
- Time Risk reason: Without precise velocity and acceleration data, TTC can't be reliably calculated.  The slight longitudinal closing motion raises some concern.
- Time safety score: 3 (Medium Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 3 (Medium Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 30214**
- Distance Risk reason: Located Rear-Left and moving away longitudinally (-14.16m).  However, it's laterally approaching the ego vehicle.
- Distance safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
- Time Risk reason: Moving away longitudinally reduces risk, but the lateral motion needs monitoring.  TTC cannot be accurately determined.
- Time safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 4 (Low Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 30219**
- Distance Risk reason: Located Rear-Left and relatively close (-9.07m). Concerningly, it's driving towards the ego from behind and laterally approaching.
- Distance safety score: 2 (High Risk)
- Time Risk reason: Closing from behind poses a significant risk.  Accurate TTC is needed but unavailable.
- Time safety score: 2 (High Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 2 (High Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 30220**
- Distance Risk reason: Located in Front and moving away longitudinally (13.18m). The lateral information is unclear ("Exact lateral alignment or unknown case").
- Distance safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
- Time Risk reason: Moving away longitudinally reduces risk. Lateral movement is ambiguous.
- Time safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 4 (Low Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 30223**
- Distance Risk reason: Located Behind and moving away longitudinally (-7.48m).  Lateral movement appears minimal.
- Distance safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
- Time Risk reason: Receding motion suggests low risk.
- Time safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 4 (Low Risk)


- **Obstacle ID: 30227**
- Distance Risk reason: Located Behind and far away longitudinally (-17.49m), also moving further away. Lateral movement seems minimal.
- Distance safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- Time Risk reason: Receding motion implies very low risk.
- Time safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 5 (Negligible Risk)

{
  "CollisionObstacle": null,
  "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null,
  "IsCollisionScenario": false,
  "Justification": "Although no immediate collision is detected, Obstacle 30219 presents a high risk due to its closing motion from the rear-left.  More precise data is required for definitive collision prediction."
