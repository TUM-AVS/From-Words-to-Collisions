Let me analyze each obstacle at the most recent timestep (0.9 seconds) and assess collision risk:

1. Obstacle 30209 (Front-left):
   - Adjusted distances: longitudinal 8.25m, lateral 2.15m
   - Relative velocity: longitudinal -0.03 m/s (approaching), lateral 0.17 m/s (moving away)
   - MDC: 2.15m (lateral distance is increasing)
   - TTC: Not applicable (lateral distance increasing, longitudinal approach very slow)
   - Risk: 4 (Low Risk) - No imminent collision threat

2. Obstacle 30214 (Rear-left):
   - Adjusted distances: longitudinal -14.16m, lateral 2.80m
   - Relative velocity: longitudinal -11.30 m/s (moving away), lateral -3.61 m/s (approaching)
   - MDC: 2.80m (lateral distance)
   - TTC: 2.80/3.61 = 0.78s (lateral)
   - Risk: 2 (High Risk) - Significant lateral approach but still >1m distance

3. Obstacle 30219 (Rear-left):
   - Adjusted distances: longitudinal -9.07m, lateral 18.21m
   - Relative velocity: longitudinal 3.70 m/s (approaching), lateral -1.26 m/s (approaching)
   - MDC: 9.07m (longitudinal is smaller than lateral)
   - TTC: 9.07/3.70 = 2.45s (longitudinal)
   - Risk: 3 (Medium Risk) - Approaching from behind but still significant distance

4. Obstacle 30220 (Front):
   - Adjusted distances: longitudinal 13.18m, lateral 0.00m
   - Relative velocity: longitudinal 2.60 m/s (moving away), lateral 0.26 m/s
   - MDC: 13.18m
   - Risk: 5 (No Risk) - Moving away in both dimensions

5. Obstacle 30223 (Behind):
   - Adjusted distances: longitudinal -7.48m, lateral 0.00m
   - Relative velocity: longitudinal -0.52 m/s (moving away), lateral 0.06 m/s
   - MDC: 7.48m
   - Risk: 5 (No Risk) - Moving away in both dimensions

6. Obstacle 30227 (Behind):
   - Adjusted distances: longitudinal -17.49m, lateral 0.00m
   - Relative velocity: longitudinal -1.81 m/s (moving away), lateral 0.04 m/s
   - MDC: 17.49m
   - Risk: 5 (No Risk) - Moving away in both dimensions

Trajectory Analysis:
- No obstacles show collision (distance â‰ˆ 0m) at any timestep
- Obstacle 30214 shows the highest risk with lateral TTC of 0.78s, but MDC remains >2.5m
- All other obstacles either maintain safe distances or are moving away
- No extreme risk (score 1) situations detected
