### Analysis of the Most Recent Timestep (0.9 seconds)

#### Obstacle 30209
- **Position**: Front-left of the ego car.
- **Adjusted Distances**: Longitudinal = 8.25m, Lateral = 2.15m.
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal = -0.03 m/s, Lateral = 0.17 m/s.
- **Motion**: Obstacle is moving toward longitudinally but moving away laterally.
  
**Trajectory Analysis**:
- **Longitudinal Distance**: Slightly decreasing (moving toward)
- **Lateral Distance**: Increasing (moving away)
  
**Risk Assessment**:
1. **TTC Longitudinal**: Not applicable (distance separated and velocity low)
2. **TTC Lateral**: Not applicable (moving away)
3. **MDC**: Minimum of both adjusted distances = 2.15m (lateral distance dominates as paths are diverging).
  
- **Risk Score**: 3 (Medium Risk) since MDC falls in 1-3 meters range and paths diverge in lateral direction.

#### Obstacle 30214
- **Position**: Rear-left of the ego car.
- **Adjusted Distances**: Longitudinal = -14.16m, Lateral = 2.80m.
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal = -11.30 m/s, Lateral = -3.61 m/s.
- **Motion**: Obstacle is moving away longitudinally but toward laterally.
  
**Trajectory Analysis**:
- **Longitudinal Distance**: Increasing (moving away)
- **Lateral Distance**: Decreasing slightly or moving in a slightly leftward. 

**Risk Assessment**:
1. **TTC Longitudinal**: Not applicable (moving away)
2. **TTC Lateral**: Approximately 0.775s (2.80m / 3.61m/s)
3. **MDC**: Minimum distance is primarily lateral = 2.80m. 
  
- **Risk Score**: 2 (High Risk) due to TTC being < 1 second in lateral direction.

#### Obstacle 30219
- **Position**: Rear-left of the ego car.
- **Adjusted Distances**: Longitudinal = -9.07m, Lateral = 18.21m.
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal = 3.70 m/s, Lateral = -1.26 m/s.
- **Motion**: Obstacle is approaching both longitudinally and laterally.
  
**Trajectory Analysis**:
- **Longitudinal Distance**: Decreasing (approaching)
- **Lateral Distance**: Decreasing rapidly (approaching) 

**Risk Assessment**:
1. **TTC Longitudinal**: Approximately 2.45 seconds (9.07m / 3.70m/s)
2. **TTC Lateral**: Approximately 14.46 seconds (18.21m / 1.26m/s)
3. **MDC**: Given motion, focus shifts mainly to longitudinal path, and current position remains at 9.07m.
  
- **Risk Score**: 3 (Medium Risk), as paths are merging longitudinally, but the time to reach is longer than lateral adjustments.

#### Obstacle 30220
- **Position**: Front of the ego car.
- **Adjusted Distances**: Longitudinal = 13.18m, Lateral = 0.00m.
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal = 2.60 m/s, Lateral = 0.26 m/s.
- **Motion**: Moving away longitudinally.
  
**Trajectory Analysis**:
- **Longitudinal Distance**: Increasing (moving away)
  
**Risk Assessment**:
1. **TTC Longitudinal**: Not applicable (distance increasing)
2. **MDC**: No risk given significant separation of 13.18m longitudinally.
  
- **Risk Score**: 5 (No Risk).

#### Obstacle 30223
- **Position**: Behind the ego car.
- **Adjusted Distances**: Longitudinal = -7.48m, Lateral = 0.00m.
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal = -0.52 m/s.
- **Motion**: Moving away.
  
**Trajectory Analysis**:
- **Longitudinal Distance**: Increasing (moving away)
  
**Risk Assessment**:
1. **TTC Longitudinal**: Not applicable (negative velocity)
2. **MDC**: No risk given upward separation trajectory
  
- **Risk Score**: 5 (No Risk).

#### Obstacle 30227
- **Position**: Behind the ego car.
- **Adjusted Distances**: Longitudinal = -17.49m, Lateral = 0.00m.
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal = -1.81 m/s.
- **Motion**: Moving away.
  
**Trajectory Analysis**:
- **Longitudinal Distance**: Increasing (moving away)
  
**Risk Assessment**:
1. **TTC Longitudinal**: Not applicable (negative velocity)
2. **MDC**: No risk given separation.
  
- **Risk Score**: 5 (No Risk).

### Conclusion

The highest risk scenario observed is from Obstacle 30214, suggesting a high risk due to lateral convergence, emphasizing the need for immediate caution. Overall, none of these obstacles currently represent an imminent collision, given the current path and distances.
