The ego vehicle (ID 30104.0) and the obstacle (ID 30101.0) are in different lanelets (1288/1469 vs. 80) and their y-coordinates (-411 to -413 vs. -407 to -408) suggest they are on different, roughly parallel paths. However, their x-coordinates are getting closer over time.  While the data doesn't explicitly give lanelet geometry, the consistent difference in y-coordinates and the similar orientations suggest a possible lane change maneuver by the ego vehicle might lead to a future risk if the obstacle's trajectory remains unchanged.  For the given timeframe, though, the lateral separation is significant, and a collision appears unlikely in the very near future.  The available data suggests the risk is currently low, but further monitoring is needed, especially if the ego vehicle intends to change lanes.
