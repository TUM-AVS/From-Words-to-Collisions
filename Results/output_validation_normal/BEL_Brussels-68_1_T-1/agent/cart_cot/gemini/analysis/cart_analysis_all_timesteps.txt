Here's an analysis of the provided scenario, focusing on the last timestep (0.9 seconds) and utilizing preceding data for trajectory prediction.

**Analysis at t=0.9s:**

* **Ego Position:** (-98.5533, -411.8567)
* **Obstacle 30101.0 Position:** (-111.8194, -407.1625)

**Observations and Calculations:**

1. **Distance:** The Euclidean distance between the ego and the obstacle is approximately `sqrt((-98.5533 - -111.8194)^2 + (-411.8567 - -407.1625)^2) = sqrt(13.2661^2 + -4.6942^2) ≈ 14.05 meters`.

2. **Velocity Difference:**
    * **X-direction:** Ego's X-velocity is derived from its movement between 0.8s and 0.9s: (-98.5533 - -98.0368) / 0.1 = -5.165 m/s.  The obstacle's X-velocity is similarly derived: (-111.8194 - -111.2807) / 0.1 = -5.387 m/s. The relative X-velocity is approximately -5.165 - (-5.387) = 0.222 m/s.
    * **Y-direction:** Ego's Y-velocity (from 0.8s to 0.9s) is (-411.8567 - -412.0462) / 0.1 = 1.895 m/s. The obstacle's Y-velocity: (-407.1625 - -407.3513) / 0.1 = 1.888 m/s.  The relative Y-velocity is 1.895 - 1.888 = 0.007 m/s.

3. **TTC (Time to Collision):**
    * **Longitudinal (X-direction):** TTC_x = Distance_x / Relative_velocity_x = (13.2661) / 0.222 ≈ 59.76 seconds.
    * **Lateral (Y-direction):**  TTC_y = Distance_y / Relative_velocity_y = (-4.6942) / 0.007 ≈ -670.6 seconds.  The negative value indicates the vehicles are moving further apart in the y-direction.  For practical application, it would be more useful to look at Time-to-Closest-Approach.

4. **MDC (Minimum Distance to Collision):** MDC is approximately 14.05 meters at the current timestep.

**Risk Assessment:**

Given the current distance, velocities, and TTC values, the risk of collision at the current timestep (0.9s) is very low.  The vehicles are moving almost parallel in similar directions, separated by substantial distance.  The slight converging X velocity would take an extended duration (near 1 minute) for an impact if movements remain constant, which is very unrealistic for traffic situations.

**Prediction:**

Based on the fairly consistent velocities and considering the lanelet information, the vehicles appear to be moving in parallel lanes.
