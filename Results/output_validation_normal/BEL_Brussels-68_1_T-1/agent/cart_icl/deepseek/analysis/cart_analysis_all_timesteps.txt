### Analysis:

1. **Ego Vehicle (30104.0)**:  
   - Position: (-98.5533, -411.8567)  
   - Orientation: 2.7899 rad (~160°)  
   - Velocity: 5.4836 m/s  
   - Acceleration: -0.0388 m/s² (decelerating slightly)  

2. **Obstacle (30101.0)**:  
   - Position: (-111.8194, -407.1625)  
   - Orientation: 2.8044 rad (~160.7°)  
   - Velocity: 5.705 m/s  
   - Acceleration: -0.1352 m/s² (decelerating slightly)  

#### Relative Motion Analysis:
- **Longitudinal Distance**:  
  - The obstacle is ~13.2661 m ahead of the ego vehicle (calculated as Euclidean distance between positions).  
  - Relative longitudinal velocity: 5.705 - 5.4836 = 0.2214 m/s (obstacle is moving slightly faster).  
  - **TTC**: 13.2661 / 0.2214 ≈ 59.9 seconds (very large, no immediate risk).  

- **Lateral Distance**:  
  - The obstacle is in lanelet 80.0, while the ego is in lanelet 1469.0 (different lanes, no overlap).  

#### Risk Assessment:
- The obstacle is far ahead and moving at a similar speed, with a large TTC.  
- No significant risk of collision in the near future.
