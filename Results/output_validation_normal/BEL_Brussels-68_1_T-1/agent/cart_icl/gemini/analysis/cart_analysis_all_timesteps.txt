At t=0.9s, the ego vehicle at (-98.5533, -411.8567) is in lanelet 1469. Obstacle 30101 is at (-111.8194, -407.1625) in lanelet 80.  The lateral distance is significant, and the obstacle's trajectory suggests it will remain in a different lane. While the longitudinal distance is decreasing, the difference in Y coordinates and differing lanelets suggest they are on different, likely parallel, paths and a safe distance apart.  Therefore, the risk of collision is low.
