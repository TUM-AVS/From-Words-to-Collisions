The obstacle is moving away from the ego vehicle with a longitudinal velocity of 0.22 m/s and a lateral velocity of 0.08 m/s. The longitudinal distance is increasing, currently at 9.56 meters.  Given the current distance, relative velocity, and the fact the obstacle is moving away, the risk level is negligible.
