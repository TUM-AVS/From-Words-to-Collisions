### Obstacle-by-Obstacle Analysis

#### Obstacle 30101 (Front of ego car)
- **Most Recent Timestep (0.9s):**
  - **Adjusted Longitudinal Distance:** 9.56 m
  - **Adjusted Lateral Distance:** 0.00 m (exact alignment)
  - **Relative Velocity:** 
    - Longitudinal: 0.22 m/s (moving away)
    - Lateral: 0.08 m/s (moving away)
  - **Motion Description:** Obstacle is moving away longitudinally. Exact lateral alignment or unknown case.

- **Trajectory Analysis:**
  - From 0.1s to 0.9s, the longitudinal distance initially decreases slightly (9.53m to 9.49m) but then increases to 9.56m, indicating the obstacle is now moving away from the ego vehicle.
  - The lateral distance remains 0.00m throughout, but the lateral velocity is positive (0.08 m/s), indicating the obstacle is moving away laterally as well.
  - The relative velocities in both dimensions are positive, meaning the obstacle is moving away from the ego vehicle in both longitudinal and lateral directions.

- **Time-to-Collision (TTC):**
  - Longitudinal TTC: Not applicable (relative velocity is positive, moving away).
  - Lateral TTC: Not applicable (relative velocity is positive, moving away).
  - Since both TTCs are not applicable (diverging paths), the risk from TTC is **5 (Negligible Risk)**.

- **Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC):**
  - The obstacle is longitudinally aligned (lateral distance = 0.00m), but the longitudinal distance is large (9.56m) and increasing.
  - MDC is effectively the current longitudinal distance (9.56m), which is > 5.0m.
  - Risk from MDC is **5 (Negligible Risk)**.

- **Overall Risk Assessment:**
  - Both TTC and MDC indicate negligible risk (score 5).
  - The obstacle is moving away in both dimensions, and there is no convergence in trajectories.

    "CollisionObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": null,

}
```

### Explanation:
- There is no collision or extreme/high-risk obstacle in this scenario. The only obstacle (30101) is moving away from the ego vehicle in both longitudinal and lateral directions, with a large and increasing distance. Thus, the risk is negligible (score 5). The JSON summary reflects this with null values for collision and risk categories.
