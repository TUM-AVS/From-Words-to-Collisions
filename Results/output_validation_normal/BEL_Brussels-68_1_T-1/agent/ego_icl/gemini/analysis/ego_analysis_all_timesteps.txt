Obstacle 30101 is in front of the ego vehicle and shows a lateral distance of 0.00 m across all timesteps, indicating perfect lateral alignment.  Longitudinally, the obstacle starts at 9.53m and initially gets closer to the ego vehicle (9.51m at 0.2s) before moving further away (9.56m at 0.9s). The most recent timestep (0.9s) shows the obstacle at 9.56m with a positive longitudinal velocity of 0.22 m/s (moving away).

Given the increasing longitudinal distance and positive (separating) longitudinal velocity, there is no risk of collision.

**TTC Calculation (Longitudinal):**
TTC is not applicable here as the relative longitudinal velocity is positive, meaning the vehicles are moving apart.

**MDC Calculation:**
Since the lateral distance is 0.00m, the MDC is equal to the longitudinal distance, which is 9.56m.

**Risk Assessment:**
Based on the MDC of 9.56m and the diverging trajectory, the risk level is 5 (Negligible Risk).
