**Obstacle Analysis:**

**Obstacle 30101:**

1. **Trajectory Analysis:**
   - At 0.0 to 0.9 seconds, Obstacle 30101 was consistently in the front of the ego vehicle.
   - At the beginning (0.0-0.2s), it moved towards the ego vehicle showing decreasing longitudinal distances.
   - After 0.2 seconds, the obstacle started moving slightly away from the ego vehicle, evidencing an increasing longitudinal distance trend from 9.49m to 9.56m at 0.9 seconds.
   - Throughout these timesteps, the lateral distance remained at 0.00m, signaling same-lane alignment, but without immediate collision since the relative longitudinal distance was not near zero.
   
2. **Most Recent Timestep (0.9 seconds) Analysis:**
   - **Position:** Front of the ego vehicle. 
   - **Adjusted Distances:** 
       - Longitudinal: 9.56m 
       - Lateral: 0.00m
   - **Relative Velocity (final):** 
       - Longitudinal: 0.22 m/s (indicating moving away)
       - Lateral: 0.08 m/s
   - **Relative Acceleration (final):**
       - Longitudinal: 0.09 m/s²
       - Lateral: -0.03 m/s²
   - **MDC Calculation:** 
       - Monitored trajectory shows a minimum longitudinal distance of 9.49m (safe distance as it’s greater than 3.0m).
   - **TTC Calculation:**
       - Time-to-Collision would typically apply if trajectory was converging.
       - With relative longitudinal direction and velocity towards moving away, the TTC becomes irrelevant as there is no closing path.

3. **Risk Assessment:**
   - Longitudinal alignment is in the escaping trend with the obstacle moving away from the ego car.
   - The longitudinal distance is greater than 5m, ensuring no imminent collision or significant risk.
   
**Final Risk Score for Obstacle 30101:**
- **Risk Level: Negligible Risk** - With both MDC > 5.0m and TTC adhering to no substantial risk due to an escaping obstacle motion.
