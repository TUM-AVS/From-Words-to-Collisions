At t=0.9s, the ego vehicle at (-98.5533, -411.8567) in lanelet 1469 and the obstacle 30101.0 at (-111.8194, -407.1625) in lanelet 80 are approximately 14 meters apart laterally and 4.7 meters apart longitudinally. While the lateral distance suggests some separation, the longitudinal distance is concerning, especially considering their respective velocities and trajectories.  Over the past few timesteps, the obstacle has generally been moving towards the ego vehicle's predicted path. Although the velocities are similar, the relatively small longitudinal separation combined with the converging trajectories suggests a high risk of collision in the near future if the obstacle's path doesn't change. Therefore, I assess obstacle 30101.0 as an extreme risk (1).
