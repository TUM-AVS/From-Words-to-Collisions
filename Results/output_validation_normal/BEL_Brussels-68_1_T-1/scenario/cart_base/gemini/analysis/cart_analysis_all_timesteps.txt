At t=0.9s, the ego vehicle is at (-98.5533, -411.8567) in lanelet 1469 and the obstacle 30101 is at (-111.8194, -407.1625) in lanelet 80.  While the lanelets are different, the x and y positions indicate proximity. Comparing the positions across time steps shows the vehicles are moving in roughly parallel directions, and the distance between them isn't rapidly decreasing. Therefore, although they are relatively close, an immediate collision is not likely. I classify this as a medium risk (3), not extreme (1) or collision (0).
