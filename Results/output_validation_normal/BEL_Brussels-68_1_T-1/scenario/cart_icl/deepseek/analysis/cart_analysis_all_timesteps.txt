### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep:

### Obstacle Analysis:
- **Obstacle ID**: 30101.0  
  - **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is in a different lanelet (80.0) than the ego vehicle (1469.0). Over the past timesteps, the lateral distance between them has remained consistent (~15-16 meters), and their orientations are nearly parallel (2.7899 vs. 2.8044 radians). The longitudinal distance is large (~13.3 meters) and increasing slightly.  
  - **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)  
  - **Time Risk reason**: The relative velocity between the ego (5.4836 m/s) and the obstacle (5.705 m/s) is small (~0.22 m/s), and both are decelerating slightly. The TTC is very large (>60 seconds) due to the large longitudinal distance and small relative velocity.  
  - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)  
  - **Overall Risk score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)  

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. **Lanelet Separation**: The ego and obstacle are in different lanelets (1469.0 vs. 80.0), indicating no immediate intersection.  
2. **Trajectory Trends**: Both vehicles are moving in nearly parallel paths with consistent lateral separation.  
3. **Relative Motion**: The longitudinal distance is increasing slightly, and the relative velocity is minimal.  
4. **Acceleration Patterns**: Both vehicles are decelerating gently, with no erratic behavior.  
5. **Conclusion**: No collision risk.
