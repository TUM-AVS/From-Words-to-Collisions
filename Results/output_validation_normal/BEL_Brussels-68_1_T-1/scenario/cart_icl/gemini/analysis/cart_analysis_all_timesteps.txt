### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 30096.0
- Distance Risk reason: Far away from ego vehicle and moving away.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: No time-based risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 30097.0
- Distance Risk reason: Relatively far from ego, but trajectory and lane changes observed. Requires monitoring.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Closing velocity exists, but not immediately concerning.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- Obstacle ID: 30101.0
- Distance Risk reason: Moderate distance, but lane change towards ego possible given past trajectory.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: Some velocity convergence observed, needs careful monitoring.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3

- Obstacle ID: 30102.0
- Distance Risk reason: Reasonably close and lateral movement observed across lanes.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason:  Velocity difference is minimal, increasing risk with lane changes.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3

- Obstacle ID: 30103.0
- Distance Risk reason: Relatively close and in a different lane, but trajectory unclear.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: Some velocity convergence, requires attention.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
No immediate collisions observed. However, Obstacle 30101.0, 30102.0 and 30103.0 require close monitoring due to proximity, lane changes, and converging velocities, posing a potential risk in the near future. No obstacles exhibited extreme risk levels, but their trajectories and behaviors warrant continuous assessment.

### Summary in JSON Format:
