### Obstacle Analysis:

#### Obstacle ID: 30096.0
- **Distance Risk Reason**: Obstacle is located on lanelet 320.0, initially far from ego vehicle in lanelet 1288.0, maintaining a consistent distance with no trend of convergence.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 5 (Negligible risk)
- **Time Risk Reason**: The obstacle shows a stable trajectory with minimal relative velocity change towards the ego vehicle. The acceleration patterns have been steady.
- **Time Safety Score**: 5 (Negligible risk)
- **Overall Risk Score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 30097.0
- **Distance Risk Reason**: Despite moving in lanelet 1290.0 towards the direction of the ego, the positions remain separated by a significant margin.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 5 (Negligible risk)
- **Time Risk Reason**: Movement slightly reduces the distance but not enough to pose an immediate risk, as velocity trends show minor changes.
- **Time Safety Score**: 5 (Negligible risk)
- **Overall Risk Score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 30101.0
- **Distance Risk Reason**: Situated in lanelet 80.0, it consistently remains apart from the ego's path in lanelet 1288.0 with no approaching trend.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 5 (Negligible risk)
- **Time Risk Reason**: Accelerations and velocities indicate a stable situation with no cause for concern over the timesteps.
- **Time Safety Score**: 5 (Negligible risk)
- **Overall Risk Score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 30102.0
- **Distance Risk Reason**: Though it changes lanelets, its trajectory diverts from the ego with a consistent separation maintained over time.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 5 (Negligible risk)
- **Time Risk Reason**: Orientation and velocity do not indicate any impending trajectory crossing with the ego vehicle.
- **Time Safety Score**: 5 (Negligible risk)
- **Overall Risk Score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 30103.0
- **Distance Risk Reason**: Despite being in a nearby lanelet, it consistently moves along a path divergent from the ego's trajectory.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 5 (Negligible risk)
- **Time Risk Reason**: Similar velocity trends and acceleration patterns maintain a steady state separate from the ego vehicle.
- **Time Safety Score**: 5 (Negligible risk)
- **Overall Risk Score**: 5

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
No obstacles present a collision or extreme risk scenario based on their consistent separation and maintained velocities and accelerations, indicating no impending breaches in safe distance.
