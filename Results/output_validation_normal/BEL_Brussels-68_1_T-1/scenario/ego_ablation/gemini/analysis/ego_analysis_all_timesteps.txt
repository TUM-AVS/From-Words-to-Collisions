Obstacle 30101 is moving away from the ego vehicle with a longitudinal relative velocity of 0.22 m/s and a lateral relative velocity of 0.08 m/s. The longitudinal distance is increasing, suggesting no immediate risk.  The lateral distance is consistently 0, suggesting perfect alignment or an unknown lateral behavior. Although the lateral velocity is non-zero, it is small, and coupled with the increasing longitudinal distance, it does not pose an immediate threat in the very next timestep. Given the current trend, no collision is imminent.
