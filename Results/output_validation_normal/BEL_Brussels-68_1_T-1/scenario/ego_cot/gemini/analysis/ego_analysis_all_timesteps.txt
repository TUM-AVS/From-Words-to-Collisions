### Safety analysis for timestep 0.9 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 30101
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 30101 is located 9.56m longitudinally and 9.56m laterally in front of the ego vehicle.  Given the significant distance and the fact it's moving away, there is no immediate distance-based risk.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: The obstacle is moving away from the ego vehicle longitudinally (0.22 m/s) and slightly to the side (0.08 m/s). This indicates a decreasing risk of collision over time.  With the current distance and velocity, a collision is highly unlikely.  We don't have explicit TTC values calculated, but based on the provided data, the implied TTC is very high.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5
