### Obstacle-by-Obstacle Analysis

#### Obstacle 30101 (Most Recent Timestep: 0.9 seconds)
- **Position**: Front of ego car
- **Adjusted Distances**: 
  - Longitudinal: 9.56 m (raw distance matches adjusted since no adjustment values are provided)
  - Lateral: 0.00 m (exact alignment)
- **Relative Velocity**: 
  - Longitudinal: 0.22 m/s (moving away from ego)
  - Lateral: 0.08 m/s (very minor lateral movement)
- **Relative Acceleration**: 
  - Longitudinal: 0.09 m/s² (positive, but very small)
  - Lateral: -0.03 m/s² (negligible)
- **Motion Description**: Obstacle is moving away longitudinally. Exact lateral alignment or unknown case.

#### Trajectory Analysis (Across Timesteps)
- The obstacle initially approaches the ego car very slightly (longitudinal velocity -0.22 m/s at 0.1s), but quickly transitions to moving away (positive longitudinal velocity from 0.3s onward).
- The lateral distance remains exactly 0.00 m throughout, but the lateral velocity is very small (0.08 m/s) and not increasing.
- The longitudinal distance increases from 9.53 m at 0.1s to 9.56 m at 0.9s, confirming the obstacle is moving away.

#### TTC Calculation
- **Longitudinal TTC**: Not applicable (positive relative velocity means obstacle is moving away)
- **Lateral TTC**: Not applicable (lateral distance is stable at 0.00 m with negligible velocity)

#### MDC Calculation
- **Longitudinal MDC**: 9.56 m (no risk)
- **Lateral MDC**: 0.00 m (alignment, but no collision risk since trajectories are diverging)

#### Risk Assessment
- **Longitudinal Risk**: 5 (No Risk, MDC > 5.0 m and moving away)
- **Lateral Risk**: 5 (No Risk, exact alignment but no convergence)
- **Overall Risk Score**: 5 (No Risk)

### Conclusion
- There is no collision or extreme risk from Obstacle 30101. The obstacle is moving away from the ego car longitudinally, and the exact lateral alignment does not pose a risk due to the lack of converging trajectories.
