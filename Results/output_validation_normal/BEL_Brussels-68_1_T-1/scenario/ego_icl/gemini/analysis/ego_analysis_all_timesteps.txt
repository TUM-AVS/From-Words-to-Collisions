Obstacle 30101 Analysis:

Trajectory Analysis:
- Lateral distance consistently at 0.00m, indicating perfect lateral alignment with the ego vehicle.  This does *not* automatically mean a collision, but requires careful attention to the longitudinal motion.
- Longitudinal distance initially decreases slightly from 9.53m to 9.49m between 0.0s and 0.4s, then increases to 9.56m by 0.9s. This indicates the obstacle initially approached slightly, then started moving away.
- The motion description confirms this, transitioning from "driving toward" to "moving away" from the ego vehicle.

TTC and MDC Calculation (at 0.9s):
- Longitudinal distance: 9.56m
- Lateral distance: 0.00m
- Longitudinal relative velocity: 0.22 m/s (moving away)
- Lateral relative velocity: 0.08 m/s

- Longitudinal TTC: Not applicable for collision assessment since the relative velocity is positive (moving away).
- Lateral TTC:  Not applicable for collision assessment as vehicles are longitudinally aligned. Irrelevant in this scenario as the main movement is longitudinal.

- MDC: With lateral alignment (0.00m) and increasing longitudinal distance, the MDC is effectively the longitudinal distance of 9.56m.

Risk Assessment:
- Since the obstacle is moving away longitudinally and the lateral distance, while zero, is not decreasing, there is no immediate risk of collision.
- MDC > 5.0m and longitudinal velocity is positive (moving away).

- Overall Risk Score: 5 (No Risk)

Collision Scenario Determination:
Since the only obstacle has a risk score of 5 (No Risk), this is NOT a collision scenario.
