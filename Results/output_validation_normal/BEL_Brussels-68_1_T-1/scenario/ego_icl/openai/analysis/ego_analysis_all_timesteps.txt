### Obstacle-by-Obstacle Analysis

#### Obstacle 30101 Trajectory Analysis
- **Initial Tracking (0.0 to 0.9 seconds)**:
  - **Longitudinal Distance** decreased slightly initially but began increasing over time; at 0.9 seconds, it is 9.56 meters.
  - **Lateral Distance** remained at 0.00 meters throughout, indicating exact lateral alignment.
  - **Relative Longitudinal Velocity** transitioned from negative (moving towards the ego) to positive (moving away from the ego).
  - **Relative Lateral Velocity** remained positive, indicating a slight lateral movement away from the ego but negligible in overall risk as lateral distance remained 0.00 meters.
  - **Overall Motion** initially indicated approaching but then started moving away from the ego vehicle after 0.2 seconds.

#### Most Recent Timestep Analysis (0.9 seconds)
- **Adjusted Longitudinal Distance**: Use the real distance as adjusted values are not provided, assuming they are equivalent in this context.
  - Longitudinal Distance: 9.56 meters
  - Lateral Distance: 0.00 meters

- **Time-to-Collision (TTC) Calculation**:
  - **Longitudinal TTC**: With relative velocity at 0.22 m/s moving away from the ego, TTC is not applicable as they are diverging.
  - **Lateral TTC**: Relative velocity minimal at 0.08 m/s with no effective lateral change, indicating no lateral collision risk.

- **Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC) Analysis**:
  - Longitudinal MDC: Given diverging paths, longitudinal MDC does not decrease significantly.
  - Lateral MDC: 0.00 meters, but trajectory is diverging.
  
- **Risk Assessment**:
  - From direction and trajectory analysis at 0.9 seconds, the obstacle is moving away.
  - **Risk Level**: No Risk (5) since longitudinal distance is increasing and lateral distance remains non-problematic due to diverging paths.

### Conclusion
Based on the most recent assessment at 0.9 seconds:
- **Obstacle 30101** is not at risk of collision given the increasing longitudinal distance and diverging trajectory.

### Is This a Collision Scenario?
- **No**, this is not a collision scenario. The analysis shows no obstacles with risk scores of 0 or 1 within the given scenario.
