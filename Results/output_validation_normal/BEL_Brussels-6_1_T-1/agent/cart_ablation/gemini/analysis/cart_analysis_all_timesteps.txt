The ego vehicle and obstacle 30095 are in different lanelets (1465 and 332 respectively).  Analyzing the provided position data, the y-coordinates suggest the obstacle is on a roughly parallel path but significantly offset to one side (higher y-value).  The x-coordinates show the obstacle ahead of the ego vehicle and closing the distance slightly over the time period.  While they are getting closer, there's no indication in the given data of an immediate or unavoidable collision.  Further data points and information about the lanelet geometry would be needed for a more precise assessment.
