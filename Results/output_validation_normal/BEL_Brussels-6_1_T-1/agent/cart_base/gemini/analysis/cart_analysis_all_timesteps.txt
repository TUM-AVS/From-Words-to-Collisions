The ego vehicle and obstacle 30095 are in different lanelets (1465 and 332 respectively).  While the provided data doesn't give us lanelet geometry, the positions and velocities suggest the vehicles are moving roughly parallel.  The lateral distance between the vehicles seems significant, and although closing slightly in the provided timeframe, it doesn't immediately suggest an imminent collision. Further data points are needed to assess the long-term risk, especially considering the lanelets might intersect or merge at some point in the future.  For now, based on the short-term trajectory, the risk appears manageable.
