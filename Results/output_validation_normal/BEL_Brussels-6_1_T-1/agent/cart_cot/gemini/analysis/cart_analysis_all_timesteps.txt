Here's the collision risk analysis for the provided scenario:

**Analysis at t=0.9s:**

1. **Ego Vehicle State:**
   - Position: (-157.6314, -449.5319)
   - Velocity: 5.9926 (We'll need more information to decompose this into x and y components)
   - Acceleration: -0.7835 (Again, directional components needed)

2. **Obstacle (ID: 30095.0) State:**
   - Position: (-153.2509, -431.6293)
   - Velocity: 6.1991 (Directional components needed)
   - Acceleration: 0.0195 (Directional components needed)

3. **Distance Calculation:**
   - Δx = -153.2509 - (-157.6314) = 4.3805
   - Δy = -431.6293 - (-449.5319) = 17.9026
   - Distance = sqrt(Δx² + Δy²) ≈ 18.42m

4. **TTC Estimation (Approximation without directional velocity components):**  TTC calculations require the components of velocity in the direction of the other object. Since we only have the magnitudes of the velocities, we can only estimate.

   - Assuming the vehicles are roughly heading in the same general direction (based on similar orientations and lanelet information), and focusing on the y-component of the distance (since the x-component is relatively small), a *very* rough estimate can be made by dividing the y-distance by the difference in velocity magnitudes.

   - *Rough* TTC_y ≈ 17.9026 / abs(6.1991 - 5.9926) ≈  89.65 s. This is a highly simplified approximation.

5. **MDC:** Minimum Distance between Centers (current) ≈ 18.42m

6. **Risk Assessment:**

   Although the MDC is currently substantial, we *must* consider the trajectories. We lack precise velocity and acceleration components, preventing accurate TTC calculation. However, since their y-positions are converging and we don't have enough information on lateral movement, we should consider a medium risk due to the limited information.


**Overall Risk Considerations:**

- **Lack of Complete Velocity/Acceleration Information:** The missing x and y components of velocity and acceleration significantly limit the accuracy of the analysis. We cannot reliably determine the true closing speeds.
- **Lanelet Information:**  While the vehicles are in different lanelets, we don't know the road geometry.  The lanelets could be merging or intersecting soon. This is a potential risk factor not fully captured in the numerical analysis.
- **Orientation Information:** Orientations (1.18-1.33 radians) suggest both vehicles are pointed in roughly the same direction. However, small changes in orientation over time could drastically alter their trajectories.
