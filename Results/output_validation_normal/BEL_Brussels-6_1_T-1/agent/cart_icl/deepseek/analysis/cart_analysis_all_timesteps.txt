### Analysis:

1. **Ego Vehicle (ID: 30099.0)**:
   - Position: (-157.6314, -449.5319)
   - Orientation: 1.2846546388862456 radians (~73.6 degrees)
   - Velocity: 5.9926 m/s
   - Acceleration: -0.7835 m/s² (decelerating)
   - Lanelet: 1465.0

2. **Obstacle (ID: 30095.0)**:
   - Position: (-153.2509, -431.6293)
   - Orientation: 1.3309 radians (~76.3 degrees)
   - Velocity: 6.1991 m/s
   - Acceleration: 0.0195 m/s² (nearly constant speed)
   - Lanelet: 332.0

### Relative Motion and Risk Assessment:
- **Relative Position**: The obstacle is ahead and to the right of the ego vehicle. The lateral distance is significant, and the obstacle is in a different lanelet (332.0 vs. 1465.0), indicating no immediate overlap.
- **Relative Velocity**: The obstacle is moving slightly faster (6.1991 m/s vs. 5.9926 m/s), but the paths are not converging.
- **TTC (Time to Collision)**: Not applicable here since the lateral distance is large, and the trajectories are not intersecting.
- **MDC (Minimum Distance to Collision)**: The distance between the ego and the obstacle is increasing over time, indicating no risk of collision.

### Risk Score:
- **Overall Risk Score**: 5 (Negligible Risk) - No significant risk of collision due to non-intersecting paths and increasing distance.
