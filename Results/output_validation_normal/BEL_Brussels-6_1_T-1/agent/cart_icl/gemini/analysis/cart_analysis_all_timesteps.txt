At t=0.9s, the ego vehicle at (-157.6314, -449.5319) is moving with a velocity of 5.9926 and decelerating at -0.7835.  The obstacle (ID 30095) is at (-153.2509, -431.6293), velocity 6.1991 and accelerating slightly at 0.0195.

The lateral distance between the ego and the obstacle is approximately 18 meters, and the longitudinal distance is about 4.38 meters. The obstacle is slightly ahead of the ego and in a different lanelet. While the obstacle is moving slightly faster than the ego vehicle, the lateral separation suggests no immediate collision risk. However, it's crucial to continue monitoring the obstacle's trajectory in subsequent time steps to ascertain any potential future risks.  A rough estimate of TTC based on longitudinal motion only gives a value over 0.7 seconds; however, given the different lanelets, this value isn't meaningful without further context about road geometry. Given the available data, we classify this situation as a medium risk due to the closing longitudinal distance, but with the expectation that lanelets likely diverge and the risk will decrease in future steps.
