### Analysis:

#### Current Setup:
- **Ego Vehicle (ID: 30099.0)** at 0.9 seconds:
  - Position: (-157.6314, -449.5319)
  - Orientation: 1.2847
  - Velocity: 5.9926 m/s
  - Acceleration: -0.7835 m/s²
  - Lanelet: 1465.0

- **Obstacle (ID: 30095.0)** at 0.9 seconds:
  - Position: (-153.2509, -431.6293)
  - Orientation: 1.3309
  - Velocity: 6.1991 m/s
  - Acceleration: 0.0195 m/s²
  - Lanelet: 332.0

#### Observations:
1. **Trajectory and Position:**
   - The ego vehicle consistently moves in a southward direction along its lanelet (1465.0) with decreasing velocity due to negative acceleration.
   - The obstacle is also moving with a slight decrease and slight increase in velocity around a nearby lanelet (332.0).

2. **Relative Motion:**
   - The obstacle is moving almost parallel but situated significantly away in the Cartesian plane.
   - The obstacle is in a different lanelet (332) and is positioned over 20 meters away from the ego vehicle's trajectory, ensuring a significant lateral clearance.

3. **Time to Collision (TTC) and Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC):**
   - **TTC:** Given the direction and lanelet information, there's no immediate risk of overlap because both vehicles are in separate lanelets moving linearly with no indications of intersecting paths.
   - **MDC:** Based on positional evaluation, the minimum calculated distance remains consistently safe across the observed trajectory, always staying above a minimum safe lateral distance.

4. **Risk Assessment:**
   - There is no immediate or severe risk involved. The ego and the obstacle have no crossing paths or overlapping trajectories in this timeframe.

### Risk Evaluation:

- The analysis shows no collision risk, low relative velocity closure, separate lanelets, and safe minimum distance maintained.
