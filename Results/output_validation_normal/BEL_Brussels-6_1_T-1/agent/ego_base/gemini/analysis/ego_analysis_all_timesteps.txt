At t=0.9s, obstacle 30095 is in front of the ego vehicle, at a longitudinal distance of 13.90m and lateral distance of 0.00m. The relative longitudinal velocity is 0.20 m/s (moving away from the ego car), and the lateral velocity is 0.29 m/s.  The obstacle is moving away longitudinally, meaning the risk of a collision is decreasing. The lateral movement might need to be monitored, but given the current distances and velocities, the risk is not immediate. The obstacle appears to be moving away from a potential collision path.  This warrants a low-risk assessment.
