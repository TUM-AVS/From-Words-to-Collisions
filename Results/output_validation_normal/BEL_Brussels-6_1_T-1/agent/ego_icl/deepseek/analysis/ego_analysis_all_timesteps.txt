### Obstacle Analysis: Obstacle 30095

#### Trajectory Analysis:
1. **0.1s to 0.3s**: Obstacle is in the Front-left of the ego car. The longitudinal distance is decreasing (14.51m → 14.20m), indicating the obstacle is approaching the ego car longitudinally. The lateral distance is also decreasing (0.78m → 0.24m), but the motion description states the obstacle is moving away laterally to the left (positive lateral velocity). This suggests the lateral distance is decreasing due to the ego car's movement or other factors, but the obstacle itself is moving away laterally.
2. **0.4s to 0.7s**: Obstacle is now directly in front of the ego car (lateral distance = 0.00m). The longitudinal distance continues to decrease (14.09m → 13.92m), but the rate of decrease slows down. The relative longitudinal velocity changes from -0.86 m/s to -0.15 m/s, indicating the obstacle is slowing its approach.
3. **0.8s to 0.9s**: The obstacle starts moving away longitudinally (relative longitudinal velocity becomes positive: 0.11 m/s → 0.20 m/s). The longitudinal distance stabilizes at 13.90m, and the lateral distance remains 0.00m.

#### Most Recent Timestep (0.9s):
- **Position**: Front of the ego car (longitudinal = 13.90m, lateral = 0.00m).
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal = 0.20 m/s (moving away), Lateral = 0.29 m/s (moving away).
- **Motion Description**: Obstacle is moving away longitudinally and laterally.

#### Risk Assessment:
1. **Time-to-Collision (TTC)**:
   - Longitudinal: Since the obstacle is moving away (relative velocity = 0.20 m/s), TTC is not applicable (no collision risk in this dimension).
   - Lateral: The obstacle is moving away (relative velocity = 0.29 m/s), so TTC is not applicable here either.
   - **TTC Risk**: 5 (No Risk).

2. **Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC)**:
   - The obstacle is directly in front (lateral = 0.00m), but the longitudinal distance is large (13.90m) and increasing.
   - **MDC Risk**: 5 (No Risk).

3. **Overall Risk**:
   - The obstacle is moving away in both dimensions, and the distances are large. No imminent collision risk.
   - **Overall Risk Score**: 5 (No Risk).

### Explanation:
- There is no collision or extreme/high risk obstacle in the scenario. The only obstacle (30095) is moving away from the ego car in both longitudinal and lateral directions, with a large and increasing distance. Thus, the risk is negligible (score 5).
