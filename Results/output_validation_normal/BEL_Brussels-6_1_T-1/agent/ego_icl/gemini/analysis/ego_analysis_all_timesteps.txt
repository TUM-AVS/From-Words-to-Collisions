Obstacle 30095 Analysis:

Trajectory Analysis:
The obstacle started in the front-left of the ego vehicle and gradually moved to be directly in front of the ego vehicle over 0.9 seconds.  Laterally, it has been moving left, and while the raw lateral distance appears to be 0.00m, indicating perfect alignment, the motion description clarifies that the obstacle *is* moving left relative to the ego vehicle. Longitudinally, it initially closed in on the ego vehicle but began moving away in the last two timesteps.

TTC Calculation (0.9 seconds):
- Longitudinal TTC: The longitudinal relative velocity is positive (0.20 m/s), meaning the obstacle is moving away from the ego vehicle. Therefore, longitudinal TTC is not meaningful for collision assessment in this case.
- Lateral TTC:  The lateral relative velocity is positive (0.29 m/s), meaning the obstacle *is* still moving to the left relative to the ego vehicle. Lateral TTC is not relevant for collision in the front.


MDC Calculation (0.9 seconds):
Given the longitudinal distance of 13.90m and the lateral motion away from the ego vehicle, MDC would be greater than the longitudinal distance, and definitely larger than 5.0m.

Risk Assessment:
The obstacle is moving away longitudinally and laterally from the ego vehicle, thus posing no immediate risk of collision.

Overall Risk Score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
