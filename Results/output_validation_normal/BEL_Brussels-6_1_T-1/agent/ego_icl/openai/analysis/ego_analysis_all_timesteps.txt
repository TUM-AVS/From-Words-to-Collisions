### Obstacle Analysis for Obstacle ID: 30095

**Trajectory and Position Analysis:**
- Over the timesteps from 0.0 to 0.9 seconds, Obstacle 30095 moved from the front-left to directly in front of the ego car.
- The lateral distance decreased from 0.78m to 0.00m, reaching exact lateral alignment.
- Longitudinal distances decreased initially, suggesting the obstacle was approaching the ego car up to 0.7 seconds, after which it started moving away.
- The obstacle moved laterally leftward and longitudinally closer initially then began moving away longitudinally.

**Most Recent Timestep Analysis (0.9 seconds):**
- **Adjusted Longitudinal Distance:** 13.90 meters
- **Adjusted Lateral Distance:** 0.00 meters
- **Relative Longitudinal Velocity:** 0.20 m/s (moving away)
- **Relative Lateral Velocity:** 0.29 m/s (moving away)

**TTC Calculations:**
- **Longitudinal TTC = Longitudinal Distance / |Longitudinal Velocity| = 13.90 m / 0.20 m/s = 69.5 seconds**
  - Given the positive velocity, indicating the obstacle is moving away longitudinally, there's no immediate threat.
- **Lateral TTC = Not directly applicable** due to a lateral velocity indicating movement away from alignment.
  
**MDC Calculations:**
- The adjusted longitudinal separation (13.90m) means the MDC remains sufficiently large, reducing any immediate collision threat as no closing trajectory toward the ego is indicated.

**Risk Assessment:**
- Since the obstacle is moving away from the ego longitudinally, with a long-time calculated due to its movement trajectory, and the lateral alignment is not indicating closing risk, the scenario presents a negligible risk.

Based on these calculations, the risk level is determined by the more imminent measure, which is the prolonged TTC due to its away trajectory. Therefore, this presents a Negligible Risk with a scoring of 5.
