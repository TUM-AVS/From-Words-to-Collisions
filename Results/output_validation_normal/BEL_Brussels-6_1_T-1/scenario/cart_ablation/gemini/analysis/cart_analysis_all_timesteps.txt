At t=0.9s, the ego vehicle is at (-157.6314, -449.5319) and the obstacle (ID 30095.0) is at (-153.2509, -431.6293).  The distance between them is approximately 18.5 meters. While the vehicles are in different lanelets and the obstacle's trajectory hasn't indicated an immediate lane change, the relatively short distance and closing velocities warrant attention.  However, with no immediate lane change indicated, the risk is not yet extreme. This situation needs further monitoring as the trajectories evolve.
