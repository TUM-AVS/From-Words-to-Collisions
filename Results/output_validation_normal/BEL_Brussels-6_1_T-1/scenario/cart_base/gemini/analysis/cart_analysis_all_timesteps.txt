At t=0.9s, the ego vehicle is at (-157.6314, -449.5319) and the obstacle (ID 30095.0) is at (-153.2509, -431.6293).  The distance between them is approximately 18.3 meters. While the obstacle is in a different lanelet, the trajectories and decreasing velocities suggest a potential future conflict if the ego vehicle were to change lanes or if the obstacle's trajectory changes unexpectedly. However, at this specific moment, the separation and lack of immediate lane conflict suggest the risk is manageable. The risk is medium (3) and not high enough to classify as collision or extreme risk (â‰¤1).

    "Reasoning": "No immediate collision risk at t=0.9s.  Obstacle 30095.0 is approximately 18.3 meters away in a different lanelet.  While future conflict is possible depending on trajectory changes, current separation is sufficient."
