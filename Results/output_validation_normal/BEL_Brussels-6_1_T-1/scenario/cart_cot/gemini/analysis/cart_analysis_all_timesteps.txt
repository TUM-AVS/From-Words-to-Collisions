### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 30095.0
- Distance Risk reason: The obstacle is in a different lanelet than the ego vehicle. While the y-coordinates suggest some lateral proximity, the different lanelets and the consistent trajectories over the past 0.9 seconds indicate that they are moving in parallel and not converging in a way that poses an immediate threat. The minimum distance between the ego vehicle and the obstacle over the observed period is greater than the safe distance.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: The relative velocities and accelerations of the ego vehicle and obstacle indicate that they are maintaining their respective lanes. The trends over the previous timesteps show no signs of sudden changes that would increase the risk of a collision.  While the ego vehicle is decelerating more strongly, it is not doing so in a manner that would cause it to encroach on the obstacle's path.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4


### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. **Identify the most critical obstacles:** Obstacle 30095.0 is the only obstacle observed. Its proximity in the Y-axis makes it potentially critical, but it is not a significant risk as it is in a different lanelet, and they move almost parallel to each other. 

2. **Analyze their trajectories over all 10 timesteps:** Both the ego vehicle and the obstacle maintain relatively straight paths within their respective lanelets.  There's no indication of erratic movement or lane changes.

3. **Evaluate relative positions, velocities, and accelerations:** The obstacle maintains a fairly constant velocity, while the ego vehicle is decelerating, they are not closing on each other. Their differing orientations further reinforce the assessment that their paths are diverging rather than converging.

4. **Determine if any collision has occurred or is imminent:** No collision has occurred, and none appears imminent based on the provided data.

5. **Explain your reasoning for your conclusion:** The combination of separate lanelets, consistent trajectories, and relative velocities/accelerations suggest that the ego vehicle and the obstacle will maintain a safe distance.  While lateral proximity might raise some initial concern, the overall analysis of the provided data points towards a low risk of collision.
