### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep:
Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:
- **Obstacle ID**: 30095.0  
  - **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is in a different lanelet (332.0) than the ego vehicle (1465.0). Over the past timesteps, the distance between them has been increasing (from ~19.3m at 0.1s to ~17.9m at 0.9s). The orientations are also diverging slightly.  
  - **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)  
  - **Time Risk reason**: The ego vehicle is decelerating (current velocity: 5.9926 m/s, acceleration: -0.7835 m/sÂ²), while the obstacle is moving at a relatively constant speed (~6.2 m/s). The relative velocity is small, and the distance is increasing.  
  - **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)  
  - **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low Risk)  

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. **Lanelet Separation**: The ego and obstacle are in different lanelets (1465.0 vs. 332.0), reducing collision risk.  
2. **Trajectory**: The obstacle is moving away from the ego vehicle (distance increasing over time).  
3. **Velocity/Acceleration**: The ego is decelerating, while the obstacle maintains a steady speed, further reducing risk.  
4. **Conclusion**: No immediate or high-risk collision scenario.
