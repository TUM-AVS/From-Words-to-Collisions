### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 30094.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is laterally far from ego vehicle and moving away.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason:  Relative velocity and acceleration suggest no immediate risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5
- Obstacle ID: 30095.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is relatively close to ego vehicle but the lateral distance is significant and increasing.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Relative velocities and accelerations indicate decreasing risk.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4
- Obstacle ID: 30096.0

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
No obstacles are on a direct collision course with the ego vehicle.  All obstacles maintain a safe lateral distance and show no immediate risk of collision based on their current trajectories. The scenario is not a collision scenario.
