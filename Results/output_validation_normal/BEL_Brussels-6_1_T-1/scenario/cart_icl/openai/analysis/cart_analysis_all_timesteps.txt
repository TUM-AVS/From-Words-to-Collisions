### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

#### Obstacle ID: 30094.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is in lanelet 1469.0, which was previously not in the same trajectory as the ego vehicle. Based on its historical path, it remains distant from the ego vehicle.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: The velocity and acceleration trends of the obstacle show no immediate threat to the ego's path.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 30095.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: Consistently remains in a different lanelet 332.0, showing no trend of moving towards the ego vehicle.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: Obstacle velocity and path is stable with suitable acceleration, indicating no immediate interaction with the ego path.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 30096.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: Positioned consistently away from the ego vehicle, moving parallel without a sign of convergence.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: Relative velocity and acceleration do not pose a collision threat, maintaining separation.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 30097.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: Has changed its lanelet to 1469.0, indicating a possible movement towards the ego lanelet, but remains sufficiently spaced out.
- **Distance safety score**: 4
- **Time Risk reason**: Rapid deceleration and reduced velocity, maintaining a safe distance without posing immediate collision risk.
- **Time safety score**: 4
- **Overall Risk score**: 4

#### Obstacle ID: 30098.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: Located in a separate lanelet consistent with its path history in lanelet 78.0, no convergence towards ego vehicle.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: Stable trajectory with minor acceleration changes, showing no collision tendency.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. **Ego vehicle analysis**: Maintains a stable path in lanelet 1465.0 with consistent deceleration and decreasing velocity.
2. **Trajectory evaluation**: None of the obstacles have shown drastic trajectory changes that intersect or converge with the ego vehicle's path in any immediate risk manner.
3. **Distance evaluation**: Presently, all obstacles are in different lanelets and exhibit distances which do not pose a risk to the ego vehicle in the near term.
4. **Risk levels**: Overall, no indications of collision or extreme risk patterns based on the observed speeds, accelerations, and trajectories.
