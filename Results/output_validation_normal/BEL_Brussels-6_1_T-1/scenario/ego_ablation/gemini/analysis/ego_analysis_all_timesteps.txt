Obstacle 30095 is moving away longitudinally from the ego vehicle with a relative longitudinal velocity of 0.20 m/s and a small lateral velocity of 0.29 m/s. The lateral distance is 0.00 m, indicating the obstacle and ego vehicle are aligned longitudinally. However, since the obstacle is moving away longitudinally, and the lateral velocity is relatively small, the risk of collision is negligible.
