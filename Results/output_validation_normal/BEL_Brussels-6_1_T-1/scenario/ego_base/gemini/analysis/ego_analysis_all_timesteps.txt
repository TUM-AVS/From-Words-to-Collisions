Obstacle 30095 is moving away longitudinally from the ego vehicle at a relative velocity of 0.20 m/s and a lateral velocity of 0.29 m/s.  The lateral distance is 0.00 m suggesting the obstacle is directly in front. While the longitudinal motion suggests decreasing risk, the persistent small lateral velocity combined with the close longitudinal distance (13.90m) still represents some level of risk if the lateral velocity were to change direction towards the ego vehicle.  However, based on the current snapshot, the risk appears low.
