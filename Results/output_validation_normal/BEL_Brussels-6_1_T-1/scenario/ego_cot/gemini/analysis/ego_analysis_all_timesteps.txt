### Safety analysis for timestep 0.9 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 30095
- Distance Risk reason: At 0.9 seconds, Obstacle 30095 is in front of the ego vehicle at a longitudinal distance of 13.90m and a lateral distance of 13.90m.  While the lateral distance is substantial, the longitudinal distance is moderately large. The obstacle is moving away longitudinally.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: The obstacle is moving away longitudinally (positive relative longitudinal velocity). This significantly reduces the risk of collision, although the lateral movement towards the ego vehicle (small, positive lateral velocity) needs to be monitored. Since the longitudinal motion is away from the ego car, TTClong can be considered high. As the lateral velocity is low and lateral distance is high, TTClat can also be considered not a concerning risk.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4


### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
  "CollisionObstacle": null,
  "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null,
  "IsCollisionScenario": false,
  "Justification": "No obstacle poses an immediate collision risk. Obstacle 30095, while initially approaching longitudinally, is now moving away from the ego vehicle. The lateral movement is not significant enough to cause concern given the relatively large lateral distance."
