### Obstacle Analysis (Obstacle 30095)

#### Trajectory Analysis (0.1s to 0.9s):
1. **Longitudinal Distance**: Starts at 14.51m and gradually decreases to 13.90m (approaching ego initially, then stabilizing).
   - Relative velocity: Initially negative (-2.02 m/s), then decreases to positive (0.20 m/s) by 0.9s (moving away).
   - Acceleration: Positive (increasing speed away from ego).
2. **Lateral Distance**: Starts at 0.78m, decreases to 0.00m by 0.4s (aligned frontally), then remains 0.00m.
   - Relative velocity: Positive (moving away laterally to the left).
   - Acceleration: Positive (increasing speed away laterally).

#### Most Recent Timestep (0.9s):
- **Adjusted Distances**: Longitudinal = 13.90m, Lateral = 0.00m (exact alignment).
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal = 0.20 m/s (moving away), Lateral = 0.29 m/s (moving away).
- **Motion Description**: "Obstacle is moving away longitudinally. Exact lateral alignment or unknown case."

#### Risk Assessment:
1. **Time-to-Collision (TTC)**:
   - Longitudinal: Not applicable (relative velocity is positive, moving away).
   - Lateral: Not applicable (relative velocity is positive, moving away).
   - **TTC Risk**: 5 (No Risk, diverging paths).

2. **Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC)**:
   - Lateral distance = 0.00m (aligned), but obstacle is moving away laterally.
   - Longitudinal distance = 13.90m (large, increasing).
   - **MDC Risk**: 5 (No Risk, large distance and diverging).

3. **Overall Risk**:
   - The obstacle is moving away in both dimensions, and the distance is large.
   - **Overall Risk Score**: 5 (No Risk).

#### Collision Scenario Determination:
- No collision (risk score 0) or extreme risk (risk score 1) observed.
- Obstacle is moving away and poses no immediate threat.
