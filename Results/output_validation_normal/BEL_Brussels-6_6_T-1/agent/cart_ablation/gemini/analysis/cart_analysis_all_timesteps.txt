The ego vehicle starts in lanelet 1465 and transitions to lanelet 332 sometime between 0.8 and 0.9 seconds.  The obstacle (ID 30095) is consistently in lanelet 332.  While the distance between the ego vehicle and the obstacle decreases over the provided timeframe, the provided data points don't suggest an immediate or certain collision. Further data points beyond 0.9 seconds are needed to definitively assess the risk, especially given the lane change of the ego vehicle.  The close proximity and lane change maneuver warrant a high-risk assessment.
