The ego vehicle starts in lanelet 1465 and transitions to lanelet 332 around the 0.9-second mark.  The obstacle (ID 30095) is consistently in lanelet 332.  Initially, there's a significant distance between the ego and the obstacle. However, the distance decreases over the provided timesteps. By t=0.9s, both are in the same lanelet and the distance has shrunk considerably. The continuous approach of the ego vehicle towards the obstacle, coupled with their presence in the same lanelet at t=0.9s suggests a potential collision in the very near future. Although not explicitly colliding within the provided data, the trend points to a high probability of an imminent collision, warranting an extreme risk assessment.
