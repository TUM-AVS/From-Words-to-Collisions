At t=0.9s, the ego vehicle is at (-156.9458, -447.0983) and the obstacle is at (-153.5399, -432.8112).  The ego vehicle has changed lanelets and is now also in lanelet 332. This is a critical piece of information suggesting a lane change maneuver by the ego vehicle.

**Calculations and Reasoning:**

1. **Longitudinal Distance:** The difference in the y-coordinates represents the longitudinal distance.  At t=0.9s, this is -447.0983 - (-432.8112) = -14.2871.  Since this value is negative, the obstacle is ahead of the ego vehicle.

2. **Lateral Distance:** The difference in the x-coordinates represents the lateral distance.  At t=0.9s, this is -156.9458 - (-153.5399) = -3.4059. The obstacle is to the right of the ego vehicle.

3. **Estimated Time to Collision (TTC):**

* **Longitudinal TTC:**  Approximating the relative longitudinal velocity as the difference in the y-components of their velocities (not explicitly given, but can be inferred from position changes), we see the ego vehicle is closing the gap with the lead obstacle. Given the small lateral distance and this longitudinal closing behavior, a longitudinal collision risk exists.  Precise TTC is difficult to compute without the explicit velocity vectors, but the data suggests it's likely less than 2 seconds.

* **Lateral TTC:** Even more concerning is the rapidly decreasing lateral distance.  Without explicit velocity vectors, a precise lateral TTC is challenging to calculate.  However, the small magnitude of the lateral distance coupled with lane change into same lane by Ego suggests near-term collision risk.

4. **Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC):** At t=0.9s, the MDC is approximately sqrt((-14.2871)^2 + (-3.4059)^2) =  14.71 meters. This distance seems safe but is misleading without considering the trajectories, relative velocities, and the shared lanelet occupancy which is where the greatest risk lies.

5. **Overall Risk Assessment:** The ego vehicle just changed lane into the same lane with Obstacle, and they are moving with relatively similar velocity. The small lateral distance and slightly decreasing longitudinal distance indicate an unsafe lane change has occurred.  Combined with the limited ability to precisely estimate TTC due to missing velocity components, the potential for collision is very high and immediate action is needed by the Ego to avoid a collision.
