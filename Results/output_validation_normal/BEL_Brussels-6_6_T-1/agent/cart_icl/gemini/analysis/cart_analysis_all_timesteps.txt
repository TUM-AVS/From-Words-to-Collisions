At t=0.9s, the ego vehicle is at (-156.9458, -447.0983) and the obstacle (ID 30095) is at (-153.5399, -432.8112).  Both are now in the same lanelet (332).

The obstacle is approximately 3.4m ahead in the x-direction and 14.29m ahead in the y-direction.  The ego vehicle's velocity is decreasing while the obstacle's velocity is relatively stable around 4.68 m/s. The ego vehicle is changing lanes, indicated by the fluctuating orientation angle and may continue this lane change towards the obstacle's location.  Calculating a precise TTC is difficult due to the lane change maneuver, but the decreasing distance and roughly parallel trajectories suggest a potential collision if the ego vehicle continues its current trajectory. This requires further monitoring as the risk level is increasing.
