At the 0.9-second mark, let's focus on the relative positions and motion of the Ego vehicle (ID: 30099.0) and the obstacle vehicle (ID: 30095.0):

### Analysis of the Latest Timestep (0.9 seconds):

- **Ego Position**: (-156.9458, -447.0983), Orientation: 1.3069, Velocity: 5.7873 m/s
- **Obstacle Position**: (-153.5399, -432.8112), Orientation: 1.3312, Velocity: 4.688 m/s

#### Relative Motion Analysis:

- **Lanelets**: Both Ego and Obstacle vehicles are located in lanelet 332.0, indicating they are potentially on the same path.
- **Longitudinal Distance**: Calculating the longitudinal gap:
  - Ego X: -156.9458, Obstacle X: -153.5399, giving a longitudinal distance of approximately 3.41 meters.
  
- **Relative Longitudinal Velocity**: 
  - Ego Velocity: 5.7873 m/s
  - Obstacle Velocity: 4.688 m/s
  - Relative Velocity = Ego - Obstacle = 5.7873 - 4.688 = 1.0993 m/s, implying Ego is closing in on the obstacle at 1.0993 m/s.

#### Safety Metrics:

- **Time to Collision (TTC) Calculation**:
  - Relative longitudinal velocity: 1.0993 m/s. However, since we assume the obstacle is ahead based on the Y positions, the minus sign indicates a reduction in distance.
  - Relative longitudinal position: 3.41 m
  - TTC = 3.41 / 1.0993 = approximately 3.10 seconds.
  
- **Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC)**:
  - Given the current longitudinal and lateral positions, any slight deviation or sudden stop can lead to quick closure of the gap.

### Risk Assessment:

- Since TTC indicates a closing gap within a few seconds while both vehicles are in the same lanelet, there is an immediate risk of collision if no evasive action is taken. Thus, the risk is deemed **High**.
  
```json
{
    "CollisionObstacles": [],
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {},
    "HighRiskObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "30095.0",
        "OverallRiskScore": 2
    }
}
``` 

This assessment concludes that while a collision has not yet occurred, the rapid closing distance and same lanelet trajectory necessitate prompt intervention to prevent a collision.
