At t=0.9s, obstacle 30095 is located 10.17m in front of the ego vehicle and perfectly laterally aligned (0.0m lateral offset). It is moving towards the ego vehicle with a longitudinal velocity of -1.10 m/s. While the relative longitudinal velocity indicates closing behavior, the current distance and relatively low closing speed suggest there's no immediate danger of a collision. Considering a typical reaction time and braking capabilities, the ego vehicle likely has sufficient time and space to avoid a collision.  It's crucial to continue monitoring this obstacle's motion in subsequent timesteps to accurately assess and react to any developing risk. Since the obstacle is approaching the ego vehicle, albeit slowly, it presents a low to medium risk. The risk is not extreme or high enough for an immediate reaction given the current parameters but requires careful monitoring.
