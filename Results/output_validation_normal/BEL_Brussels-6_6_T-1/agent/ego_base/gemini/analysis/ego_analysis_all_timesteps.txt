At t=0.9s, obstacle 30095 is 10.17m in front of the ego vehicle and moving towards it at -1.10 m/s longitudinally.  The lateral velocity is 0.11 m/s, but the lateral distance is consistently zero, suggesting the obstacle is directly ahead. While the obstacle is approaching, the closing velocity is relatively low, and the distance is still significant.  Given the current information, the risk is not immediate, but further monitoring is necessary.  A risk level of 3 (Medium Risk) seems appropriate, allowing for reaction time.
