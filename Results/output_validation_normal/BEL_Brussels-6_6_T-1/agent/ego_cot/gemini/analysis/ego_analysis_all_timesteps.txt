### Safety analysis for timestep 0.9s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:
- **Obstacle ID:** 30095
- **Distance Risk reason:** At 0.9 seconds, the obstacle is at a longitudinal distance of 10.17m and a lateral distance of 10.17m. Given that the obstacle is in the front and approaching the ego vehicle, this distance is deemed safe for now.  A lateral distance of 10.17m suggests the obstacle is significantly offset and not directly in the ego vehicle's path.
- **Distance safety score:** 4 (Low Risk)
- **Time Risk reason:** We don't have enough information to accurately determine TTC without knowing the ego vehicle's velocity and acceleration.  Assuming the ego vehicle is stationary or moving slowly, and the obstacle is approaching at approximately 1.1 m/s, a rough estimate of TTC would be around 9 seconds (10.17m / 1.1m/s). Even if the ego vehicle is moving, this time is likely sufficient for the ego vehicle to take corrective actions, meaning the overall time-based risk appears low.  The exact TTC needs to be calculated to confirm.  Since the lateral velocity of 0.11 m/s is small compared to the lateral distance (10.17m), it will take almost 90 seconds to cover that distance. 
- **Time safety score:** 4 (Low Risk)
- **Overall Risk score:** 4 (Low Risk)
