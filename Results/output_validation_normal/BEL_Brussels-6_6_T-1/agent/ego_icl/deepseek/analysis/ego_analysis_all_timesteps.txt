### Obstacle Analysis: 30095

#### Trajectory Analysis:
- **Position**: Front of the ego car (longitudinal distance decreasing, lateral distance stable at 0.00m)
- **Longitudinal Distance**: Decreasing from 11.33m to 10.17m over 0.9 seconds
- **Lateral Distance**: Consistently 0.00m (exact alignment)
- **Relative Velocity**: 
  - Longitudinal: -1.10 m/s (approaching)
  - Lateral: 0.11 m/s (minimal lateral movement)
- **Relative Acceleration**: 
  - Longitudinal: 0.08 m/s² (slight increase in closing speed)
  - Lateral: 0.30 m/s² (minimal lateral acceleration)

#### Risk Assessment:
1. **Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC)**:
   - Since the obstacle is directly in front (lateral = 0.00m), the MDC is the longitudinal distance: **10.17m**.
   - MDC > 5.0m → **Negligible Risk (5)**.

2. **Time-to-Collision (TTC)**:
   - TTC = Longitudinal Distance / |Relative Velocity| = 10.17 / 1.10 ≈ **9.25 seconds**.
   - TTC > 5.0 seconds → **Negligible Risk (5)**.

3. **Motion Description**:
   - The obstacle is approaching longitudinally but at a slow rate (1.10 m/s). The lateral distance is stable (0.00m), but the longitudinal distance is large (10.17m). No immediate collision risk.

#### Overall Risk:
- Both MDC and TTC indicate **Negligible Risk (5)**.
- No collision or extreme risk detected.
