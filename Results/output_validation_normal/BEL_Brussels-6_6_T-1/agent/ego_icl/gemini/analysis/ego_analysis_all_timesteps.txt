Obstacle 30095:

Trajectory Analysis: The obstacle has been consistently in front of the ego vehicle and laterally aligned (0.00m lateral distance) throughout all timesteps. The longitudinal distance has been decreasing, indicating the obstacle is approaching the ego vehicle.

At t=0.9s:
- Longitudinal distance: 10.17m
- Lateral distance: 0.00m
- Longitudinal relative velocity: -1.10 m/s (approaching)
- Lateral relative velocity: 0.11 m/s

TTC Calculation:
- Longitudinal TTC = 10.17m / 1.10m/s = 9.25s

MDC Calculation:
Given the consistent lateral alignment and the obstacle being directly in front, the MDC is primarily determined by the longitudinal distance.  MDC â‰ˆ 10.17m.

Risk Assessment:
- Longitudinal TTC: 9.25s suggests Negligible Risk (5).
- MDC: 10.17m suggests Negligible Risk (5).

Overall Risk Score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
