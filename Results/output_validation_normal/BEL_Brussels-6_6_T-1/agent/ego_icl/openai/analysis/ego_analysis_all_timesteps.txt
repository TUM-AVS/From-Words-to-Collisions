### Analysis of Obstacle 30095 at Most Recent Timestep (0.9 seconds):

1. **Trajectory Analysis**:
   - **Previous Timesteps**: The obstacle has been steadily approaching the ego vehicle from the front. Longitudinal distance is decreasing, indicating that the obstacle is closing in. The lateral distance remains at 0.00 m, suggesting a same-lane alignment but no lateral deviation.
   - **Current Timestep**: The obstacle is directly in front with an adjusted longitudinal distance of 10.17 meters. The obstacle's relative velocities are -1.10 m/s longitudinally (closing) and 0.11 m/s laterally.

2. **Time-to-Collision (TTC) Calculation**:
   - **TTC Longitudinal**: \( \text{Longitudinal TTC} = \frac{10.17}{1.10} = 9.24 \) seconds approximately
   - Since the lateral velocity is small and the longitudinal trajectory indicates closing, lateral TTC is not critical as paths align longitudinally.

3. **Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC) Calculation**:
   - Since the obstacle is aligned longitudinally and closing, the MDC aligns with the adjusted longitudinal distance: 10.17 meters.

4. **Risk Assessment**:
   - **Longitudinal TTC** is greater than 5 seconds, indicating an ability to react without immediate collision threat.
   - **MDC** is greater than 5 meters, providing a safe buffer.
   - Thus, the overall risk assessment from both TTC and MDC suggests low risk, given controlled conditions continue.
  
Furthermore, while the ego and obstacle vehicles are closing in terms of longitudinal alignment, the distance and TTC suggest an actionable timeframe without immediate threat.
