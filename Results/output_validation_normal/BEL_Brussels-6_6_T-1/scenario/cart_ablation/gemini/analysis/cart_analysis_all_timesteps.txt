At t=0.9s, the ego vehicle (30099.0) is at (-156.9458, -447.0983) and the obstacle (30095.0) is at (-153.5399, -432.8112).  The distance between them is approximately 14.6 meters. While this is a relatively close proximity, the ego vehicle's velocity is decreasing and both vehicles are moving in roughly the same direction (orientations ~1.3).  Given the current trajectories and decelerations, an immediate collision is not likely, but the situation requires monitoring. I'd classify this as a Medium Risk (3) at this specific moment.  No collision occurred.
