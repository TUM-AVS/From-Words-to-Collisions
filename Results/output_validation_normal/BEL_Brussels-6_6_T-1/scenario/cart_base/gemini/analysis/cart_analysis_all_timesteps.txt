At t=0.9s, the ego vehicle (30099.0) is at (-156.9458, -447.0983) and the obstacle (30095.0) is at (-153.5399, -432.8112). Both are now in lanelet 332. The distance between them is approximately 14.5 meters.  While the ego vehicle has changed lanelets and is now in the same lane as the obstacle, the trajectories and velocities suggest a likely collision in the very near future if the ego vehicle doesn't brake or maneuver.  This is an extreme risk situation.
