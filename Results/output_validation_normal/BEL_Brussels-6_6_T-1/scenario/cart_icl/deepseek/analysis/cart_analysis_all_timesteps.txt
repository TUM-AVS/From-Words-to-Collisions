### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep:

### Obstacle Analysis:
- **Obstacle ID**: 30095.0  
  - **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is in the same lanelet (332.0) as the ego vehicle at the most recent timestep (0.9s). The Euclidean distance between the ego and the obstacle is approximately 14.3 meters, which is relatively close. The obstacle has been consistently moving in the same lanelet as the ego, indicating a shared trajectory.  
  - **Distance safety score**: 2 (High Risk)  
  - **Time Risk reason**: The ego vehicle is decelerating (current acceleration: -0.1905 m/sÂ²), while the obstacle is maintaining a nearly constant speed (~4.69 m/s). The relative velocity is ~1.1 m/s (ego: 5.7873 m/s, obstacle: 4.688 m/s). The time to collision (TTC) is ~13 seconds (distance/relative velocity), which is manageable but requires monitoring due to the shared lanelet.  
  - **Time safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk)  
  - **Overall Risk score**: 2 (High Risk)  

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. **Lanelet Check**: At 0.9s, both the ego and obstacle are in lanelet 332.0, indicating a shared path.  
2. **Trajectory Analysis**: The obstacle has been moving parallel to the ego but at a slower speed, with minimal lateral deviation.  
3. **Velocity/Acceleration Trends**: The ego is decelerating, while the obstacle's speed fluctuates slightly but remains stable.  
4. **Collision Risk**: No immediate collision (TTC is ~13s), but the shared lanelet and proximity warrant high-risk classification.
