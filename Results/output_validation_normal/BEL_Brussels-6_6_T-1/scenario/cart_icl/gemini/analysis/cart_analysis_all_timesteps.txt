- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Relative velocity and acceleration suggest no immediate risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 30095.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is in a different lanelet, moderately close but moving away laterally.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason:  Relative velocity and acceleration indicate decreasing risk.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- Obstacle ID: 30096.0

- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 30097.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is in a different lanelet and moderately close but moving away.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Relative velocity and acceleration suggest decreasing risk.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- Obstacle ID: 30098.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is far from ego and not on a converging trajectory.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Relative motion suggests no imminent risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5


### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
By observing the provided data, we can deduce that no obstacle poses an immediate collision risk to the ego vehicle. All obstacles are either in different lanelets or maintain safe distances and trajectories, indicating a low overall risk.  No obstacle has a risk score of 0 or 1. Therefore, this is not a collision scenario.
