### Obstacle Analysis at the Most Recent Timestep (0.9 seconds):

**Obstacle ID: 30094.0**
- **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is not in the same lanelet or immediate trajectory as the ego vehicle (80.0 vs. 332.0). It is spatially distant from the ego vehicle.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: The obstacle maintains a stable velocity and has a consistent trajectory without indications of moving closer to the ego vehicle.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

**Obstacle ID: 30095.0**
- **Distance Risk reason**: This obstacle shares the same lanelet (332.0) with the ego vehicle. It has been steadily moving towards the ego position over the last timesteps.
- **Distance safety score**: 3
- **Time Risk reason**: The velocity gap is closing due to the higher deceleration of the ego vehicle compared to the slight acceleration of the obstacle, making it a potential concern.
- **Time safety score**: 3
- **Overall Risk score**: 3

**Obstacle ID: 30096.0**
- **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is not in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle and has been consistently moving along its path with no significant intersection trajectory.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: The velocity changes minimally influence the relative motion towards the ego, maintaining a negligible collision risk.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

**Obstacle ID: 30097.0**
- **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is not in the same lanelet and is not on a collision path with the ego vehicle, maintaining a safe spatial separation.
- **Distance safety score**: 4
- **Time Risk reason**: The obstacle displays an erratic velocity change pattern but not significantly affecting a potential path towards the ego vehicle.
- **Time safety score**: 4
- **Overall Risk score**: 4

**Obstacle ID: 30098.0**
- **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is in a different lanelet and direction, maintaining significant separation from the ego vehicle.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: Consistent velocity and path with no indications of intersecting with the ego vehicle path.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
The ego vehicle has maintained a course where potential collision risk is minimal with most obstacles significantly separated in both spatial and velocity terms, except for obstacle 30095.0, which shares the lanelet with the ego vehicle but remains at a manageable risk level due to ongoing deceleration trends and positional changes.

{
    "CollisionObstacles": null,

    "ScenarioAnalysis": {
        "IsCollisionScenario": false,
        "Reasoning": "None of the obstacles currently pose a significant collision risk with the ego vehicle. The vehicle sharing the lanelet (30095.0) is at medium risk due to the closing distance, but manageable given current velocities and trajectory paths."
