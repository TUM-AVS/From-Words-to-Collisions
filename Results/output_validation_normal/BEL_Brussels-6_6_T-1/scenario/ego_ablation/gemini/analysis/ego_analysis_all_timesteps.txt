Obstacle 30095 is moving towards the ego vehicle longitudinally with a decreasing relative velocity.  The lateral distance is consistently zero, indicating a potential head-on collision risk if the relative longitudinal velocity doesn't become positive soon. While the distance is currently over 10 meters, the consistent approach and the fluctuating, but generally small, relative longitudinal deceleration warrants attention. The slight lateral relative velocity is concerning as it's unclear if it will increase or decrease, potentially leading to a slight offset collision if it continues.  At the most recent timestep (0.9 seconds), the obstacle is still approaching at -1.10 m/s longitudinally, and the lateral velocity is minimal (0.11 m/s) but present. The distance is 10.17 meters. This warrants a higher risk score due to the persistent closure rate despite the observed deceleration.

    "IsCollisionScenario": false,
    "Reasoning": "Obstacle 30095 poses a high risk due to its continuous approach towards the ego vehicle with a small and fluctuating relative longitudinal deceleration and a small but non-zero lateral velocity.  Although the current distance suggests no immediate collision, the persistent closure rate and the uncertainty of future relative motion require close monitoring and potential intervention."
