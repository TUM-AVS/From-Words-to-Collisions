Obstacle 30095 is approaching the ego vehicle head-on, as indicated by the negative longitudinal relative velocity (-1.10 m/s).  The longitudinal distance is decreasing (10.17 m). Although the lateral distance is currently zero, the positive lateral relative velocity (0.11 m/s) suggests a potential slight lateral movement.  The relative acceleration values are relatively small, and the obstacle's approach speed is moderate. While the situation requires attention, it doesn't pose an immediate collision threat within the next timestep. It represents a potential developing risk that requires monitoring.
