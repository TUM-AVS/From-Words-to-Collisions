### Safety analysis for timestep 0.9 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 30095
- Distance Risk reason: At 0.9 seconds, Obstacle 30095 is 10.17m in front and slightly to the side (10.17m lateral) of the ego vehicle. While the distance is not immediately alarming, the consistent closing longitudinal velocity across previous timesteps suggests a collision risk if the trend continues. The slight lateral movement doesn't appear significant enough to mitigate the risk.
- Distance safety score: 3 (Medium Risk)
- Time Risk reason: We lack ego vehicle velocity, but the relative longitudinal velocity is consistently negative (around -1.1 m/s at 0.9 seconds), indicating the obstacle is approaching.  Without absolute velocities, precise TTC calculation is impossible, but the decreasing longitudinal distance and the negative relative velocity point towards a medium to high risk.
- Time safety score: 3 (Medium Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 3 (Medium Risk)


### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
    "CollisionObstacle": null,
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null,
    "IsCollisionScenario": false,
    "Justification": "No immediate collision detected. Obstacle 30095 presents a medium risk due to its closing longitudinal velocity and decreasing distance to the ego vehicle. However, at the last timestep (0.9 seconds), there isn't enough information to definitively classify it as a collision or extreme risk scenario.  More data points, especially about the ego vehicle's motion and future predictions of the obstacle's path, would be needed for a conclusive assessment."
