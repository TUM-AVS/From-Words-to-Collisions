### Obstacle-by-Obstacle Analysis (Most Recent Timestep: 0.9s)

#### **Obstacle 30095** (Front of ego car)
- **Adjusted Distances**: 
  - Longitudinal: 10.17 m (decreasing from 11.33m over 0.9s)
  - Lateral: 0.00 m (exact alignment)
- **Relative Velocity**: 
  - Longitudinal: -1.10 m/s (approaching)
  - Lateral: 0.11 m/s (slight drift, but minimal)
- **Trajectory Analysis**: 
  - The obstacle is consistently moving toward the ego longitudinally with decreasing distance (11.33m → 10.17m). 
  - Lateral alignment remains exact (0.00m), but lateral velocity is very low (0.11 m/s), indicating minimal sideways movement.
- **TTC Calculation**:
  - Longitudinal TTC = Distance / |Relative Velocity| = 10.17 / 1.10 ≈ **9.25 seconds** (No Risk, TTC > 5s)
  - Lateral TTC: Not applicable (lateral velocity is minimal and not converging).
- **MDC Calculation**:
  - Since the obstacle is directly ahead (lateral = 0.00m), MDC is effectively the longitudinal distance: **10.17m** (No Risk, MDC > 5m).
- **Risk Assessment**:
  - Longitudinal: No Risk (TTC = 9.25s, MDC = 10.17m)
  - Lateral: No Risk (no meaningful convergence)
  - **Overall Risk Score**: 5 (No Risk)

### Trajectory Trends
- The obstacle is approaching the ego at a nearly constant speed (~1.10 m/s relative velocity). 
- The longitudinal distance decreases steadily, but the rate is slow enough that collision is not imminent.
- Lateral movement is negligible (0.00m alignment with minor drift).

### Conclusion
- No collision (risk score 0) or extreme risk (risk score 1) is detected. 
- The obstacle is far enough ahead (10.17m) and closing slowly enough (TTC ≈ 9.25s) to pose no immediate danger.
