**Obstacle Analysis:**

### Obstacle 30095:
- **Relative Direction:** Front of the ego car
- **Most Recent Timesteps Analysis:**
  - **Real Distance:**
    - Longitudinal: 10.17 m (at 0.9s)
    - Lateral: 0.00 m
  - **Relative Velocity:**
    - Longitudinal: -1.10 m/s (Approaching)
    - Lateral: 0.11 m/s
  - **Relative Acceleration:**
    - Longitudinal: 0.08 m/s²
    - Lateral: 0.30 m/s² 
  - **Motion Description:** Obstacle is driving toward the ego car longitudinally. Exact lateral alignment or unknown case.

**Trajectory Analysis:**
- **Longitudinal distance** from 11.33 m at 0.1s to 10.17 m at 0.9s shows a continuous decrease. This suggests a closing trajectory between the obstacle and the ego vehicle.
- **Longitudinal relative velocity** indicates the obstacle is approaching the ego vehicle as indicated by the negative velocity.
- **Acceleration** suggests the obstacle's velocity is decreasing its approach speed, but it still maintains a closing trajectory.

**TTC and MDC Calculations:**
- **Time-to-Collision (TTC)** for longitudinal:
  - TTC = Distance / |Relative Velocity| = 10.17 m / 1.10 m/s = 9.25 seconds
   
  The TTC result indicates a low risk over the short assessment window but combined with approached trajectory monitoring can indicate an increased risk over time.
  
- **Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC):** 
  - Since the lateral distance is 0.00 m and the obstacle is aligned longitudinally, the MDC is essentially equivalent to the longitudinal distance evaluated by the trajectory projection.
  - As the obstacle approaches, the continuous reduction in distance enhances the risk without intervention.

**Risk Assessment:**
- **Calculated Risk Score:** 
  - Based on the TTC alone, the score is 5 (No Risk).
  - However, based on decreasing distances and alignment, the analysis should focus on keeping close monitoring as the trajectory continues.
  - Based on trend analysis and the continuous closing trajectory within such aligned dimensions, suggestively approaching a 4 (Low Risk) over time.
  
**Conclusion:**
- Given this scenario, the obstacle does not immediately present a collision or extreme risk in the present moment. The TTC and decreasing distance dynamics suggest diligent monitoring is necessary as conditions may change rapidly driving it to an increased risk state.

This output reports that no collision or extreme risk is currently anticipated in this scenario, but the situation merits ongoing attention due to the continuous closing nature of the obstacle's trajectory.
