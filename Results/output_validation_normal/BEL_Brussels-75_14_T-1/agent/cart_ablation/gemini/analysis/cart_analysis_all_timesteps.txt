Obstacles 30210 and 30211 are in the same lanelet (107.0) and are moving in roughly the same direction as the ego vehicle, but they are positioned laterally to the ego vehicle.  Obstacle 30207 is in a different lanelet (87.0) and its trajectory does not appear to intersect with the ego vehicle's. Obstacle 30209 appears later in the scenario and is far from the ego vehicle.

While none of the obstacles are currently colliding with the ego vehicle, obstacle 30210 shows a potential developing risk. Its lateral position is close to the ego vehicle, and though it's initially slightly ahead, the fluctuating accelerations of both vehicles could lead to a closer interaction if the ego vehicle brakes harder.  However, based on the provided data up to 0.9 seconds,  there isn't enough evidence to categorize it as an extreme or high risk yet. More data about the lanelet geometry and widths would be necessary for a more precise risk assessment.
