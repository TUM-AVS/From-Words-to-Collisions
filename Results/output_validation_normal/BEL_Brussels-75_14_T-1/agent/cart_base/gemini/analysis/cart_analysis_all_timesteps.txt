Here's an analysis of the scenario and the resulting JSON output:

**Analysis:**

* **Ego Vehicle (30208.0):**  The ego vehicle is consistently moving forward within lanelet 1310 and then 1311. Its velocity is decreasing, suggesting braking.

* **Obstacle 30207.0:** This obstacle is in a different lanelet (87.0) and its trajectory doesn't intersect with the ego vehicle's path in the given timeframe.  The lateral distance is significant, posing no immediate risk.

* **Obstacle 30210.0:** This obstacle is in lanelet 107.0 and initially moving at a speed slightly higher than the ego vehicle. However, its y-coordinate (lateral position) is significantly different and is also moving away from the ego vehicle.  The trajectories do not indicate an immediate risk.

* **Obstacle 30211.0:** This obstacle is also in lanelet 107.0 and moves at a slower speed than the ego vehicle and its y-coordinate (lateral position) places it far away. It poses no immediate risk.

* **Obstacle 30209.0:** This obstacle appears at t=0.4s in lanelet 346.0.  Its y-coordinate is substantially different from the ego vehicle, indicating it's in a different lane and far away from the ego's path.

**Conclusion:**

Based on the provided trajectory data, no obstacle presents a collision risk (0), extreme risk (1), or even a high risk (2) to the ego vehicle within the 0.9-second timeframe.  All obstacles maintain a safe lateral and longitudinal separation.
