At t=0.9s, the ego vehicle is at (370.3876, 230.3139) with a velocity of 6.8668 and acceleration of -0.3174. Let's analyze the risk posed by each obstacle:

* **Obstacle 30207.0:** Position (392.6059, 232.1495), velocity 4.9431, acceleration 0.2074. This obstacle is quite far from the ego vehicle, laterally and longitudinally.  Given the current velocities and accelerations, a collision is unlikely in the immediate future.

* **Obstacle 30209.0:** Position (369.4923, 204.4718), velocity 4.2916, acceleration 0.5533. This obstacle is significantly behind the ego vehicle and poses no immediate risk.

* **Obstacle 30210.0:** Position (356.5726, 238.5546), velocity 8.526, acceleration -0.4221. While this obstacle is behind the ego vehicle, it's in a different lane and moving faster.  However, the lateral separation suggests a low risk of collision.

* **Obstacle 30211.0:** Position (344.9475, 245.3745), velocity 7.4989, acceleration 1.2799. This obstacle is also in a different lane and further behind than 30210.0. The risk of collision is also low.

Given the positions, velocities, and accelerations at t=0.9s, none of the obstacles pose an immediate collision risk.  Obstacle 30210.0 could potentially become a concern if it continues to accelerate significantly faster than the ego vehicle, however the data provided does not suggest that a collision is imminent.
