At t=0.9s, the ego vehicle is located in lanelet 1311.  Let's analyze the risk posed by each obstacle:

* **Obstacle 30207:** Located in lanelet 87.  X difference is consistently large and increasing, indicating no risk of collision. Y values also differ significantly.  Safe.

* **Obstacle 30209:** Located in lanelet 346. Large difference in Y values indicates no risk of collision.  Safe.

* **Obstacle 30210:** Located in lanelet 107. The Y separation is large, indicating a different road/lane and negligible risk. Additionally, this obstacle is moving roughly parallel to the ego vehicle.

* **Obstacle 30211:** Located in lanelet 107. Similar to obstacle 30210, the Y separation is significant, implying a different road/lane and no immediate risk.

Given the consistent separation in position and no indication of converging trajectories, no obstacle poses a significant risk to the ego vehicle at t=0.9s.
