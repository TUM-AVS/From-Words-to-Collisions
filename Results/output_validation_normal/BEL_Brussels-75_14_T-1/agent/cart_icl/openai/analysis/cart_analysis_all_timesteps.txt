### Brief Analysis

**Ego Vehicle**:
- At the most recent timestamp (0.9s), the Ego vehicle is at (370.3876, 230.3139) with a decreasing velocity (6.8668 m/s) and acceleration (-0.3174 m/s²). It's located in lanelet 1311.0.

**Obstacle 30207**:
- This obstacle is approximately 22.2183 meters ahead, at (392.6059, 232.1495) in lanelet 87.0. It has a velocity slightly increasing to 4.9431 m/s and positive acceleration. The longitudinal and lateral velocities indicate that it's moving away from the ego, reducing collision risk over recent time steps. Risk is negligible.

**Obstacle 30209**:
- There's a lateral distance of approximately 25.8446 meters as it's in lanelet 346.0 at (369.4923, 204.4718) with a very low velocity of 4.2916 m/s. It's moving parallel but well separated spatially, presenting negligible risk.

**Obstacle 30210**:
- Positioned at (356.5726, 238.5546) in lanelet 107.0, with a velocity of 8.526 m/s, this obstacle is moving away with consistent separation in direction and minimal relative acceleration.

**Obstacle 30211**:
- Currently located at (344.9475, 245.3745) in lanelet 107.0, with a speed of 7.4989 m/s and positive acceleration of 1.2799 m/s², moving further away across the timeline, resulting in no imminent threat.

### Calculation of Time to Collision (TTC) and Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC)

Given the distances involved and trajectory orientations:

- All obstacles have a significant relative distance in both longitudinal and lateral directions (more than 20m from Ego).
- No obstacles are in the same lanelet or moving directly towards the Ego vehicle.
- TTC and MDC calculations place all obstacles beyond risky proximity as none intersect with ego path.

### JSON Output

```json
{
    "CollisionObstacles": [],
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": null,
        "OverallRiskScore": null
    },
    "HighRiskObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": null,
