At t=0.9s, Obstacle 30209 is at longitudinal 8.21m and lateral -20.91m relative to the ego vehicle, approaching with longitudinal velocity -6.14 m/s and lateral velocity 4.23 m/s. This obstacle poses a high risk due to its proximity and velocity. Although it's approaching from the front-right, the lateral velocity indicates it's moving towards the ego vehicle's path.  Further, Obstacle 30210 is behind the ego vehicle at longitudinal -11.58m and approaching with longitudinal velocity of 1.66 m/s. While moderately close, the rear approach at this speed represents a medium risk. Obstacle 30207 is at longitudinal 13.49m and lateral 11.54m. This obstacle is moving away laterally while closing in longitudinally. This represents a medium to low risk and is less concerning than the front right obstacle. Given these considerations, Obstacle 30209 requires the most immediate attention.
