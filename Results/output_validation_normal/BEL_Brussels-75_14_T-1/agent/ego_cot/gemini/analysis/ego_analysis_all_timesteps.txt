### Safety analysis for timestep 0.9s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

**- Obstacle ID: 30207**
- Distance Risk reason: Located 13.49m longitudinally and 13.49m laterally in the front-left of the ego vehicle.  This is a safe distance at the moment.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Approaching longitudinally at -6.25 m/s, but moving away laterally at 4.90 m/s. The longitudinal approach is concerning but lateral movement reduces risk. Further observation required.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3

**- Obstacle ID: 30209**
- Distance Risk reason: Located 8.21m longitudinally and 8.21m laterally in front-right. This close proximity represents a significant risk.
- Distance safety score: 2
- Time Risk reason: Approaching longitudinally at -6.14 m/s and laterally at 4.23 m/s. Both longitudinal and lateral movement indicate an increasing risk of collision.
- Time safety score: 2
- Overall Risk score: 2

**- Obstacle ID: 30210**
- Distance Risk reason: Located 11.58m behind the ego vehicle, posing minimal risk due to the ego vehicle's forward movement.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: While the obstacle is approaching from behind at 1.66 m/s longitudinally, this speed differential is not high enough to cause immediate concern.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4


**- Obstacle ID: 30211**
- Distance Risk reason: Located 25.05m behind, representing negligible collision risk.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Moving towards the ego vehicle at a slow relative longitudinal velocity of 0.63 m/s. This is not concerning given the large distance.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5
