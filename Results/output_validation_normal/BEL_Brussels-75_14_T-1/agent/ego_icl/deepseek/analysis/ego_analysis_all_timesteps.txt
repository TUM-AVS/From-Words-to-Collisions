### Obstacle-by-Obstacle Analysis

#### Obstacle 30207 (Front-left)
- **Position**: Front-left of ego car
- **Adjusted Distance**: Longitudinal 13.49 m, Lateral 11.54 m
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal -6.25 m/s (approaching), Lateral 4.90 m/s (moving away)
- **Motion**: Driving toward ego longitudinally, moving away laterally to the left
- **Trajectory Analysis**: 
  - Longitudinal distance is decreasing (approaching), but lateral distance is increasing (moving away).
  - No risk of collision as lateral distance is increasing and longitudinal distance is still large.
- **TTC**: Not applicable (lateral distance increasing, no convergence)
- **MDC**: Minimum distance is lateral (11.54 m), which is increasing. No collision risk.
- **Overall Risk**: 5 (Negligible Risk)

#### Obstacle 30209 (Front-right)
- **Position**: Front-right of ego car
- **Adjusted Distance**: Longitudinal 8.21 m, Lateral -20.91 m
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal -6.14 m/s (approaching), Lateral 4.23 m/s (approaching from right)
- **Motion**: Driving toward ego longitudinally and laterally from the right
- **Trajectory Analysis**:
  - Both longitudinal and lateral distances are decreasing (approaching).
  - Lateral distance is large (20.91 m), so collision risk is minimal despite closing velocities.
- **TTC Longitudinal**: 8.21 / 6.14 = 1.34 s (Medium Risk)
- **TTC Lateral**: 20.91 / 4.23 = 4.94 s (Low Risk)
- **MDC**: Minimum distance is longitudinal (8.21 m), which is decreasing but still large.
- **Overall Risk**: 3 (Medium Risk, based on longitudinal TTC)

#### Obstacle 30210 (Behind)
- **Position**: Behind ego car
- **Adjusted Distance**: Longitudinal -11.58 m, Lateral 0.00 m
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal 1.66 m/s (approaching), Lateral 0.15 m/s (minimal)
- **Motion**: Driving toward ego from behind, exact lateral alignment
- **Trajectory Analysis**:
  - Longitudinal distance is decreasing (approaching from behind), but at a slow rate.
  - Lateral alignment is exact, but no lateral movement toward collision.
- **TTC Longitudinal**: 11.58 / 1.66 = 6.98 s (No Risk)
- **MDC**: Lateral distance is 0.00 m, but no closing lateral velocity. Longitudinal distance is large.
- **Overall Risk**: 5 (Negligible Risk)

#### Obstacle 30211 (Behind)
- **Position**: Behind ego car
- **Adjusted Distance**: Longitudinal -25.05 m, Lateral 0.00 m
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal 0.63 m/s (approaching), Lateral 0.14 m/s (minimal)
- **Motion**: Driving toward ego from behind, exact lateral alignment
- **Trajectory Analysis**:
  - Longitudinal distance is very large and closing very slowly.
  - Lateral alignment is exact, but no lateral movement toward collision.
- **TTC Longitudinal**: 25.05 / 0.63 = 39.76 s (No Risk)
- **MDC**: Lateral distance is 0.00 m, but no closing lateral velocity. Longitudinal distance is very large.
- **Overall Risk**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
