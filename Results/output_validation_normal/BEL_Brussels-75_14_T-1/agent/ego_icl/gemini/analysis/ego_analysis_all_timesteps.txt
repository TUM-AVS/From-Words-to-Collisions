Obstacle 30207 (Front-Left):
- Trajectory: Consistently front-left, moving closer longitudinally but further away laterally.
- At 0.9s: Longitudinal distance ≈ 13.49m, Lateral distance ≈ 11.54m, Longitudinal velocity ≈ -6.25 m/s, Lateral velocity ≈ 4.90 m/s.
- TTC (Longitudinal): 13.49m / 6.25m/s ≈ 2.16s (Medium Risk)
- TTC (Lateral) Not applicable since the lateral distance is increasing.
- MDC: Since the obstacle is moving away laterally, the primary concern is longitudinal.  MDC ≈ 13.49m (Medium Risk)
- Overall Risk: Medium (3)

Obstacle 30209 (Front-Right):
- Trajectory: Emerged at 0.4s and continues front-right, getting closer in both directions.
- At 0.9s: Longitudinal distance ≈ 8.21m, Lateral distance ≈ -20.91m, Longitudinal velocity ≈ -6.14 m/s, Lateral velocity ≈ 4.23 m/s.
- TTC (Longitudinal): 8.21m / 6.14m/s ≈ 1.34s (Medium Risk)
- TTC (Lateral): Not applicable since lateral distance is increasing with ego as reference.
- MDC: As the obstacle is diagonally approaching and the longitudinal distance is smaller and decreasing, MDC ≈ 8.21m (Low Risk).
- Overall Risk: Medium (3)

Obstacle 30210 (Behind):
- Trajectory: Consistently behind, gradually getting closer longitudinally and laterally aligned.
- At 0.9s: Longitudinal distance ≈ -11.58m, Lateral distance ≈ 0.00m, Longitudinal velocity ≈ 1.66 m/s, Lateral velocity ≈ 0.15 m/s.
- TTC (Longitudinal): 11.58m / 1.66m/s ≈ 6.98s (Negligible Risk). It should be noted that the relative longitudinal velocity is positive.
- TTC (Lateral): Not applicable. Lateral velocity is almost zero.
- MDC: Since lateral distance is zero, MDC is based on the longitudinal distance. MDC ≈ 11.58m (Low Risk)
- Overall Risk: Low (4)

Obstacle 30211 (Behind):
- Trajectory: Consistently behind, initially moving away but now slowly approaching.
- At 0.9s: Longitudinal distance ≈ -25.05m, Lateral distance ≈ 0.00m, Longitudinal velocity ≈ 0.63 m/s, Lateral velocity ≈ 0.14 m/s.
- TTC (Longitudinal): 25.05m / 0.63m/s ≈ 39.76s (Negligible Risk). Note that the relative longitudinal velocity is now positive meaning obstacle is approaching ego longitudinally.
- TTC (Lateral): Not applicable. Lateral velocity is almost zero.
- MDC: Given the lateral alignment and the slowly decreasing longitudinal distance, MDC ≈ 25.05m (Negligible Risk).
- Overall Risk: Negligible (5)
