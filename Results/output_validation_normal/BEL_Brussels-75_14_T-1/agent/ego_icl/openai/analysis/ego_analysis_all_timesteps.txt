**Analysis of Each Obstacle**

### Obstacle 30207 (Front-left)
- **Trajectory Summary**: Obstacle is moving closer longitudinally and moving away laterally.
- **Most recent timestep (0.9s)**:
  - Adjusted Longitudinal Distance: 13.49 m
  - Adjusted Lateral Distance: 11.54 m
  - Relative Velocity (Longitudinal): -6.25 m/s
  - Relative Velocity (Lateral): 4.90 m/s
  - **TTC Calculation (Longitudinal)**: |13.49 / 6.25| ≈ 2.16 seconds
  - **TTC Calculation (Lateral)**: Not applicable, moving away
  - **Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC)**: Primarily longitudinal at 13.49 m

Based on the above, the risk is manageable as the obstacle is more than 5.0 meters away longitudinally with a TTC > 2.0 seconds in the longitudinal direction. Current assessment is Medium Risk (3) due to fast-approaching longitudinal velocity despite the significant distance.

### Obstacle 30209 (Front-right)
- **Trajectory Summary**: Obstacle is moving closer both longitudinally and laterally.
- **Most recent timestep (0.9s)**:
  - Adjusted Longitudinal Distance: 8.21 m
  - Adjusted Lateral Distance: 20.91 m
  - Relative Velocity (Longitudinal): -6.14 m/s
  - Relative Velocity (Lateral): 4.23 m/s
  - **TTC Calculation (Longitudinal)**: |8.21 / 6.14| ≈ 1.34 seconds
  - **TTC Calculation (Lateral)**: Not applicable (relative movement away or stable)
  - **Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC)**: Primarily longitudinal at 8.21 m

Given the trajectory and velocity, there is a significant approach, but the longitudinal distance is still above 5 meters, and TTC is under 3 seconds, indicating Medium Risk (3).

### Obstacle 30210 (Behind)
- **Trajectory Summary**: Obstacle is approaching from behind on the same lane (exact lateral alignment).
- **Most recent timestep (0.9s)**:
  - Adjusted Longitudinal Distance: -11.58 m
  - Adjusted Lateral Distance: 0.00 m
  - Relative Velocity (Longitudinal): 1.66 m/s
  - **TTC Calculation**: |11.58 / 1.66| ≈ 6.97 seconds
  - **Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC)**: Not applicable as the obstacle is behind

Since the obstacle is approaching but still a considerable distance away (-11.58 m) with a relatively slow speed, the TTC is more than 5 seconds. The risk level is Low Risk (4).

### Obstacle 30211 (Behind)
- **Trajectory Summary**: The obstacle is moving away or stable in position.
- **Most recent timestep (0.9s)**:
  - Adjusted Longitudinal Distance: -25.05 m
  - Adjusted Lateral Distance: 0.00 m
  - Relative Velocity (Longitudinal): 0.63 m/s
  - **TTC Calculation**: Not applicable, moving away
  - **Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC)**: Not applicable due to motion away

The obstacle is far away and moving away from the ego vehicle, ensuring there is no collision risk or immediate threat. The risk level is Negligible Risk (5).

### Risk Summary

Based on the aforementioned analysis of each obstacle, the current risk assessments show no extreme scenarios. Here is the JSON summary reflecting the analyzed risk levels:

```json
{
  "CollisionObstacle": {
    "ObstacleID": "None",
    "OverallRiskScore": "0"
  },
  "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {
    "ObstacleID": "None",
    "OverallRiskScore": "1"
  },
  "HighRiskObstacle": {
    "ObstacleID": "None",
    "OverallRiskScore": "2"
  }
}
```

No collision, extreme, or high-risk scenarios are detected, but monitoring is advised for Obstacles 30207 and 30209 due to medium risk from approaching trajectories.
