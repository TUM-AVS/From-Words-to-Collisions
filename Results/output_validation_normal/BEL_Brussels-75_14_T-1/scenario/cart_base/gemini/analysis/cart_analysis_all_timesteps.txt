At t=0.9s, Ego is in lanelet 1311.0 at (370.3876, 230.3139).

Obstacle 30210.0 is at (356.5726, 238.5546) in lanelet 107.0.  While the y-coordinates suggest some lateral separation, the lanelets may be close or merging, requiring further investigation. Given the closing velocities and positions, this warrants attention but isn't necessarily an extreme risk yet.

Obstacle 30211.0 is at (344.9475, 245.3745) in lanelet 107.0. This obstacle is further away from the ego vehicle than 30210.0 and appears to be moving in a similar direction.  No immediate collision risk.

Obstacle 30207.0 is located at (392.6059, 232.1495) in lanelet 87.0. This obstacle is significantly ahead of the ego vehicle and in a different lanelet, posing no immediate risk.

Obstacle 30209.0 is at (369.4923, 204.4718) in lanelet 346.0. The large difference in the y-coordinates and different lanelets indicate a substantial lateral separation. No immediate risk.

Based on the provided data, no obstacle poses an immediate collision or extreme risk at t=0.9s.  However, the proximity of obstacle 30210.0 and the possibility of lanelet merging or proximity requires further assessment.
