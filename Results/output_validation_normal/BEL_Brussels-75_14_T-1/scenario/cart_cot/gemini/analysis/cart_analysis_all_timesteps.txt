### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 30207.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 30207.0 is in a different lanelet and its y-coordinate is significantly different from the ego vehicle's, indicating no immediate lateral risk.  The x-coordinate shows it is ahead of the ego vehicle, but the historical data shows it maintaining a safe distance and moving at a slower speed.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: The obstacle's velocity is lower than the ego vehicle's and the historical trend suggests they are not on a converging path.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 30209.0
- Distance Risk reason: This obstacle is in a different lanelet and considerably behind and to the right of the ego vehicle according to both current position and historical trajectory. The y-coordinate difference confirms a significant lateral separation.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: The historical trajectory and velocity data indicate no converging path with the ego vehicle.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 30210.0
- Distance Risk reason: This obstacle is in a different lanelet. While its y-coordinate places it somewhat closer to the ego vehicle, it remains safely to the left and slightly behind based on both current position and trajectory history.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: The obstacle's velocity is slightly higher than the ego vehicle's but they are moving in the same general direction and maintaining a safe distance according to the historical data.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- Obstacle ID: 30211.0
- Distance Risk reason:  This obstacle is the closest one in a different lanelet. Its trajectory shows it is further behind and considerably to the left of the ego vehicle. While the lateral distance is smaller than with other obstacles, it still poses no immediate threat.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: The obstacle's velocity is lower than the ego vehicle's. Historical data reveals no concerning trend in terms of closing the distance between them.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4


### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. **Most critical obstacles:** Obstacle 30211.0 is the closest to the ego vehicle at the last timestep, but still in a different lanelet and at a safe distance.
2. **Trajectory analysis:** All obstacle trajectories over the 10 timesteps show consistent movement within their respective lanelets, with no sudden changes in direction or velocity indicating a potential collision course.
3. **Relative evaluation:** Relative positions, velocities, and accelerations between the ego vehicle and each obstacle suggest no imminent collisions.  No two trajectories intersect within the observed timeframe.
4. **Collision determination:** No collision has occurred or is imminent based on the given data.
5. **Reasoning:**  Although some obstacles are closer than others, the lanelet separation, combined with the consistent trajectories and velocities observed over time, provides strong evidence against any immediate collision risk.
