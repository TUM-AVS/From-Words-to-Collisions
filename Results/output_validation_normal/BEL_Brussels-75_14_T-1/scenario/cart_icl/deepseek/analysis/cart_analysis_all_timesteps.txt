### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep (0.9 seconds):

### Obstacle Analysis:

1. **Obstacle ID: 30207.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Located in lanelet 87.0, far from ego's lanelet (1311.0). Position (392.6059, 232.1495) is significantly ahead and to the side of ego (370.3876, 230.3139). Distance ~22.22m, increasing over time.
   - **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: Moving away with relative velocity ~1.92m/s (ego decelerating, obstacle accelerating slightly).
   - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 5

2. **Obstacle ID: 30209.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Located in lanelet 346.0, perpendicular to ego's path. Position (369.4923, 204.4718) is ~25.84m laterally away (y-difference).
   - **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: Moving slowly (4.29m/s) in orthogonal direction. No convergence with ego's trajectory.
   - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 5

3. **Obstacle ID: 30210.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: In adjacent lanelet (107.0), position (356.5726, 238.5546) is ~13.82m behind and ~8.24m laterally offset from ego. Distance decreasing slightly but still safe.
   - **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: Similar velocity to ego (8.53m/s vs 6.87m/s) but decelerating. TTC ~10.2s.
   - **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 4

4. **Obstacle ID: 30211.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: In same lanelet as 30210.0 (107.0), position (344.9475, 245.3745) is ~25.44m behind and ~15.06m laterally offset. Distance increasing.
   - **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: Moving slower than ego (7.50m/s) with increasing distance.
   - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 5

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. No obstacles share ego's lanelet (1311.0).
2. Closest obstacle (30210.0) is in adjacent lane with safe distance and diverging paths.
3. All obstacles are either moving away or maintaining safe distances.
4. No sudden acceleration/deceleration patterns indicating imminent danger.
5. Ego is decelerating, further reducing risks.
