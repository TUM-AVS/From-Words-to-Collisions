### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 30207.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is far from ego vehicle and moving away.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason:  Relative velocity indicates no risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 30209.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is moderately far from ego and trajectories don't appear to intersect.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Relative velocity suggests no immediate risk, but monitoring needed.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- Obstacle ID: 30210.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is on a different lanelet and far from ego.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: No immediate time-related risk due to different lanelets.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 30211.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is on a different lanelet and far from ego.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: No immediate time-related risk due to different lanelets.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 30212.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is on a different lanelet and far from ego.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: No immediate time-related risk due to different lanelets.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5


### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
No obstacle is showing immediate collision risk. Ego vehicle appears to be moving away from other traffic on different lanelets. Obstacle 30209.0 is moderately far and requires continued monitoring, though current trajectory suggests no immediate risk.  This is not a collision scenario.

### Summary in JSON Format: 
```json
{
  "CollisionObstacles": null,
  "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null,
  "ScenarioAnalysis": {
    "IsCollisionScenario": false,
    "Reasoning": "No obstacle poses an immediate collision risk.  All obstacles are either on different lanelets or maintaining safe distances and trajectories."
  }
}
