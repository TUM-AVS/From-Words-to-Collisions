### Obstacle Analysis:

**Obstacle ID: 30207**
- **Distance Risk Reason**: Obstacle 30207 is at a relatively safe distance, has been consistently located in a different lanelet than the ego vehicle, with no evident crossing trajectories at the most recent timestep.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 5
- **Time Risk Reason**: The obstacle maintains a stable velocity and stays parallel to the ego, indicating no immediate collision threat.
- **Time Safety Score**: 5
- **Overall Risk Score**: 5

**Obstacle ID: 30209**
- **Distance Risk Reason**: Positioned significantly below the ego vehicle (in the Y direction) and has shown consistent movement away, with no lateral crossing.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 5
- **Time Risk Reason**: Speed changes show a constant movement further from the ego path, decreasing collision chances.
- **Time Safety Score**: 5
- **Overall Risk Score**: 5

**Obstacle ID: 30210**
- **Distance Risk Reason**: Located ahead and to the side, moving generally parallel with a slight ahead gain, not entering ego's immediate path.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 4
- **Time Risk Reason**: Higher velocity but stable orientation, which suggests a parallel path with decreasing separation.
- **Time Safety Score**: 4
- **Overall Risk Score**: 4

**Obstacle ID: 30211**
- **Distance Risk Reason**: Positioned further from the ego vehicle and maintaining a constant lanelet and trajectory away from the ego path.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 5
- **Time Risk Reason**: Accelerating but in a manner sustaining or increasing the safe separation.
- **Time Safety Score**: 5
- **Overall Risk Score**: 5

**Obstacle ID: 30212**
- **Distance Risk Reason**: The trajectory is consistent and remains safely away from the ego path, without significant lateral movement.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 5
- **Time Risk Reason**: The acceleration and velocity trajectory show a stable relative position, with no immediate risk of approaching the ego path.
- **Time Safety Score**: 5
- **Overall Risk Score**: 5

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
No collision or extreme risk is detected in the evaluated scenario as all obstacles either maintain safe distances or follow trajectories that do not intersect with the ego vehicle's path. Relative velocity and positional analysis confirm manageable interaction space and no time-to-collision scenarios requiring urgent intervention.
