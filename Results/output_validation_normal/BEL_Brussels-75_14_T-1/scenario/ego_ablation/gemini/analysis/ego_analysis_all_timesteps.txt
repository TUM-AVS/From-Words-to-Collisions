Obstacle 30209 is approaching the ego vehicle both longitudinally and laterally from the front-right.  At the most recent timestep (0.9 seconds), it is only 8.21 meters away longitudinally and closing at a relative speed of -6.14 m/s.  Although it's laterally 20.91m away, it is moving towards the ego vehicle laterally at 4.23 m/s. This poses a high risk.

Obstacle 30210, located directly behind the ego vehicle, is closing the distance at a relative speed of 1.66 m/s and is now only 11.58 meters away longitudinally. This presents an extreme risk of a rear-end collision if the ego vehicle were to brake suddenly or if the following vehicle doesn't decelerate appropriately.
