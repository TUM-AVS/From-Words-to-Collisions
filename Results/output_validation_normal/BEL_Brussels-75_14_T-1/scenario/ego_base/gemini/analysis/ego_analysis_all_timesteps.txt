At t=0.9s, Obstacle 30209 is at longitudinal distance 8.21m and lateral distance -20.91m, moving towards the ego vehicle both longitudinally (-6.14 m/s) and laterally (4.23 m/s).  While the lateral movement suggests it might be merging, the longitudinal distance is decreasing rapidly, posing a high risk. Obstacle 30207 is at longitudinal distance 13.49m and lateral distance 11.54m, moving towards the ego vehicle longitudinally (-6.25 m/s) and away laterally (4.9 m/s). This presents a medium risk, given its current trajectory. Obstacles 30210 and 30211 are behind the ego vehicle and moving towards it, but their distances suggest they are not immediate threats.

**Risk Levels and Definitions:**
<Collision (Score: 0)>: Actual collision has occurred or is unavoidable within the next timestep.
<Extreme Risk (Score: 1)>: Immediate collision or very high likelihood of impact. Urgent action is required.
<High Risk (Score: 2)>: Close to collision or highly probable collision path. Needs prompt attention and quick manoeuvring.
<Medium Risk (Score: 3)>: Moderate collision risk but manageable with timely reactions and proper strategies.
<Low Risk (Score: 4)>: Minimal collision risk. The situation is controllable with sufficient time to react.
<Negligible Risk (Score: 5)>: No significant collision risk. Obstacles are either moving away or far enough not to interfere.

  "ScenarioAnalysis": {
    "IsCollisionScenario": false,
