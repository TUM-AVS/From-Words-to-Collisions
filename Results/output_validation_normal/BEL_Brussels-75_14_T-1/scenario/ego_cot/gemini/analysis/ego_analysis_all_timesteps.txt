### Safety analysis for timestep 0.9 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

**Assumptions and Clarifications:**

* Since adjusted distances (adjusted_d_long, adjusted_d_lat) are not provided in the scenario context, the provided real distances (DTClong, DTClat) will be used for the analysis.  It's highly recommended to include adjusted distances in future evaluations for more realistic results.
* TTC will be estimated based on current relative velocity. Constant velocity is assumed for the very short term.  This is a simplification; more sophisticated TTC calculations should consider relative acceleration and predicted future trajectories.
* A simple distance-based approach is used to estimate risk, given the lack of information about vehicle sizes and precise trajectories. More advanced methods, like those considering the combined longitudinal and lateral risk, would improve accuracy.

### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 30207**
- Distance Risk reason:  Located at 13.49m longitudinally and 13.49m laterally (front-left) and moving away laterally.  This represents a moderate distance in the predicted timeframe of the scenario.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: Closing longitudinally at -6.25 m/s. While lateral movement is away, the longitudinal closing speed poses a medium risk if the lateral movement isn't significant enough. TTC is approximately 2.2 seconds.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3

- **Obstacle ID: 30209**
- Distance Risk reason:  Closest obstacle, at 8.21m longitudinally and 8.21m laterally (front-right). Its movement indicates converging trajectories.
- Distance safety score: 2
- Time Risk reason: Closing fast longitudinally at -6.14 m/s and laterally at 4.23 m/s. TTC longitudinally is ~1.3 seconds. This poses a high risk.
- Time safety score: 2
- Overall Risk score: 2

- **Obstacle ID: 30210**
- Distance Risk reason: Located behind the ego vehicle at -11.58m longitudinally and laterally. While it's approaching from behind, the current distance provides a safety margin.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Approaching longitudinally at 1.66 m/s. TTC is approximately 7 seconds if the ego vehicle maintains its current speed. This implies a low risk.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4


- **Obstacle ID: 30211**
- Distance Risk reason: Furthest obstacle, located behind the ego vehicle (-25.05m longitudinally and laterally).
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason:  While it's moving toward the ego vehicle longitudinally at 0.63m/s, the large distance and slow closing speed indicate minimal risk. TTC is approximately 40 seconds.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5
