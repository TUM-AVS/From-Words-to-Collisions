Let me analyze each obstacle at the most recent timestep (0.9 seconds) and assess collision risks:

1. Obstacle 30207 (Front-left):
- Adjusted distances: longitudinal 13.49m, lateral 11.54m
- Relative velocities: longitudinal -6.25m/s (approaching), lateral 4.90m/s (moving away)
- Motion: Moving toward longitudinally but away laterally
- TTC longitudinal: 13.49/6.25 = 2.16s (Medium Risk)
- TTC lateral: N/A (moving away)
- MDC: Lateral distance increasing (11.54m → No Risk)
- Overall Risk: 3 (Medium Risk from longitudinal approach)

2. Obstacle 30209 (Front-right):
- Adjusted distances: longitudinal 8.21m, lateral -20.91m
- Relative velocities: longitudinal -6.14m/s (approaching), lateral 4.23m/s (approaching from right)
- Motion: Approaching from front-right diagonally
- TTC longitudinal: 8.21/6.14 = 1.34s (Medium Risk)
- TTC lateral: 20.91/4.23 = 4.94s (Low Risk)
- MDC: Both distances >5m, but diagonal approach requires monitoring
- Overall Risk: 3 (Medium Risk from longitudinal approach)

3. Obstacle 30210 (Behind):
- Adjusted distances: longitudinal -11.58m, lateral 0.00m
- Relative velocities: longitudinal 1.66m/s (approaching), lateral 0.15m/s
- Motion: Approaching from behind with exact lateral alignment
- TTC longitudinal: 11.58/1.66 = 6.98s (No Risk)
- MDC: Lateral alignment but safe following distance
- Overall Risk: 5 (No Risk)

4. Obstacle 30211 (Behind):
- Adjusted distances: longitudinal -25.05m, lateral 0.00m
- Relative velocities: longitudinal 0.63m/s (approaching), lateral 0.14m/s
- Motion: Approaching from behind with exact lateral alignment
- TTC longitudinal: 25.05/0.63 = 39.76s (No Risk)
- MDC: Very large distance
- Overall Risk: 5 (No Risk)

Trajectory Analysis:
- Obstacle 30207 shows consistent longitudinal approach but increasing lateral distance
- Obstacle 30209 shows steady diagonal approach from front-right
- Both rear obstacles are at safe distances with slow approach rates
