* **Obstacle 30207 (Front-Left):**  This obstacle is approaching the ego vehicle longitudinally but moving away laterally.  Across the timesteps, the longitudinal distance decreases from 19.06m to 13.49m, while the lateral distance increases from 7.47m to 11.54m. This diverging lateral trajectory significantly reduces collision risk.

    * **TTC (Longitudinal):** 13.49m / 6.25m/s = 2.16s
    * **TTC (Lateral):** Not applicable as the obstacle is moving away laterally.
    * **MDC:**  Given the diverging lateral movement, the MDC is primarily determined by the longitudinal distance and trajectory.  Even though the longitudinal distance is decreasing, the lateral movement makes a near-term collision unlikely.  Estimating MDC as the final longitudinal distance: 13.49m.

    * **Risk Score:** 3 (Medium Risk) due to the decreasing longitudinal distance, even though lateral movement reduces risk.

* **Obstacle 30209 (Front-Right):** This obstacle appears at t=0.4s and is approaching the ego vehicle both longitudinally and laterally.  The longitudinal distance decreases from 11.41m to 8.21m and the lateral distance from -23.05m to -20.91m in subsequent timesteps. The lateral approach, even though from a larger initial distance, warrants attention.

    * **TTC (Longitudinal):** 8.21m / 6.14m/s = 1.34s
    * **TTC (Lateral):**  20.91m / 4.23m/s = 4.94s
    * **MDC:**  Due to the converging trajectories, the MDC needs to consider both longitudinal and lateral movement. An approximation could be based on the final longitudinal distance, 8.21m but with the added concern of lateral movement.

    * **Risk Score:** 3 (Medium Risk) due to the rapidly decreasing longitudinal distance and converging lateral trajectory. This situation requires close monitoring.

* **Obstacle 30210 (Behind):**  This obstacle is behind the ego vehicle and shows a complex behavior. Initially, it was not significantly approaching. At t=0.5s however, it begins to close the distance actively and becomes an actual threat. At t=0.9s, its longitudinal relative velocity indicates active approach. The lateral distance remains 0.00m throughout, indicating perfect alignment.

    * **TTC (Longitudinal):** 11.58m / 1.66m/s = 6.98s 
    * **TTC (Lateral):**  N/A (exact alignment)
    * **MDC:** Due to the exact lateral alignment and closing longitudinal distance, the MDC is effectively zero.

    * **Risk Score:** 2 (High Risk) because of the persistent alignment, the closing velocity and distance.

* **Obstacle 30211 (Behind):** This obstacle is also behind the ego vehicle and initially moves away.  From t=0.5s onward, it shows a complex behavior, with positive velocity indicating approach, despite initially moving away. The lateral distance remains 0.00m, signifying exact alignment.

    * **TTC (Longitudinal):** 25.05m / 0.63m/s = 39.76s
    * **TTC (Lateral):** N/A (exact alignment)
    * **MDC:**  The continuous lateral alignment makes the MDC zero despite the longitudinal behavior. 

    * **Risk Score:** 4 (Low Risk) because even though it is approaching the ego vehicle, it is much further away and slowly than obstacle 30210.

**Collision Scenario Determination:**

This is NOT a collision scenario. While obstacles present risks, none meet the criteria for Collision (risk score 0) or Extreme Risk (risk score 1 with very low TTC or MDC and converging trajectories). The closest to a critical situation is obstacle 30210 (High Risk) due to the exact lateral alignment, but its TTC is not yet in the Extreme Risk range.
