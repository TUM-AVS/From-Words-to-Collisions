Here's the analysis and the resulting JSON:

**Analysis:**

We need to analyze the trajectories and relative positions/velocities of the ego vehicle and the obstacles to assess collision risk.  Since we only have 1 second of data, we can make some short-term predictions but need to be cautious about assuming longer-term behavior.

* **Obstacle 30207:** This obstacle starts relatively far from the ego vehicle and maintains a lateral separation.  While its y-coordinate is close to the ego's, it appears to be moving in a different direction (different orientation) and doesn't pose an immediate threat based on the provided data.  It is moving almost parallel but also slightly away, shown from the increasing x difference.

* **Obstacle 30208:** This obstacle is initially closer to the ego vehicle and located in a different lanelet, it begins slightly above the ego vehicle. The y positions of the ego and obstacle are quite similar which poses a risk. Further context is needed to see if it's moving away or towards ego. However, because of its proximity we should consider it a High Risk, but without more data, cannot definitively determine its immediate future behaviour.

* **Obstacle 30209:** This obstacle is quite far from the ego vehicle and in a completely different y range, posing no apparent risk.

* **Obstacle 30211:** This obstacle is also somewhat far from the ego vehicle initially and also appears to be moving in a different direction and poses no apparent risk.
