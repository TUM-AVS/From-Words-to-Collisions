Here's the analysis and the JSON output:

**Analysis:**

The primary concern is to identify potential collisions or near-misses within the provided timeframe. We need to consider the relative positions, velocities, and accelerations of the ego vehicle and the obstacles.  Since we only have a short time horizon (1 second), we can approximate future movement by assuming constant acceleration for a brief period.

* **Obstacle 30207:** This obstacle starts relatively far from the ego vehicle and moves with a similar velocity. The trajectories don't appear to intersect within the given timeframe, suggesting a low risk of collision.

* **Obstacle 30208:**  This obstacle is closer to the ego vehicle, and its y-coordinate is increasing while the ego's is slightly decreasing. While they are in different lanelets initially, by 0.7 seconds, the obstacle has transitioned into lanelet 1311, adjacent to the ego vehicle in 1312.  This represents a potential high risk scenario that needs monitoring.

* **Obstacle 30209:** This obstacle is located significantly south of the ego vehicle and poses no immediate threat.

* **Obstacle 30211:** This obstacle is southwest of the ego vehicle. While somewhat close, its trajectory doesn't appear to intersect with the ego's within the short prediction horizon.

No collision is imminent, and no obstacle poses an *extreme* risk in the next second based on the data. Obstacle 30208 requires attention because of the lane change and proximity.
