At t=0.9s, the ego vehicle is at (383.3087, 227.0486) with a velocity of 6.3194 and heading -0.49578 rad.  Let's analyze each obstacle individually, focusing on the latest provided timestamp (0.9 seconds) and utilizing past data for trajectory prediction.

**Obstacle 30207:** Located at (392.0268, 231.4232), velocity 6.1425, heading 0.8976 rad. This obstacle's lateral position is significantly different from the ego vehicle's, suggesting low lateral risk.  Longitudinally, it's ahead of the ego vehicle. Its velocity is slightly lower than the ego's and decelerating (-0.6788), making a rear-end collision by the ego vehicle unlikely in the short term.

**Obstacle 30208:**  At (369.3942, 230.9044), velocity 6.4296, heading -0.5471 rad. This obstacle is behind the ego vehicle and to its left, moving with similar speed and decelerating more aggressively than the ego vehicle.  There is no imminent collision risk.

**Obstacle 30209:** Located at (374.9687, 210.6839), velocity 5.7623, heading 0.847 rad. This obstacle is significantly to the south (lower Y-coordinate) of the ego vehicle, presenting no immediate risk.

**Obstacle 30211:** At (358.2723, 237.5575), velocity 5.9062, heading -0.5305 rad. This obstacle is behind and further left of the ego vehicle. Similar to 30208 it poses no immediate collision risk.

**Detailed Risk Assessment (t=0.9s):**

* **Obstacle 30207:**  Low risk due to lateral separation and longitudinal velocity difference. MDC appears moderate but safe, TTC estimation would yield a safe value.
* **Obstacle 30208:** Low Risk. It is behind the ego vehicle.
* **Obstacle 30209:** Negligible risk due to large lateral separation. 
* **Obstacle 30211:** Low Risk. It is further behind the ego vehicle than Obstacle 30208 and further to the left.
