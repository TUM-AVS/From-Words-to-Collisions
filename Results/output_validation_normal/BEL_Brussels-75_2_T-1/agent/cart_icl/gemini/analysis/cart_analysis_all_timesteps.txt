At t=0.9s, the ego vehicle is at (383.3087, 227.0486) with a velocity of 6.3194 m/s and an orientation of 0.4957 radians. Let's analyze each obstacle:

* **Obstacle 30207:** Located at (392.0268, 231.4232).  The lateral distance is significant, and the longitudinal distance is increasing. While the obstacle is on a converging trajectory based on lanelet information (not provided in detail, but inferred), the current separation and velocities suggest low risk.

* **Obstacle 30208:** Located at (369.3942, 230.9044). This obstacle is behind and to the left of the ego vehicle and the distance appears to be increasing. Low risk.

* **Obstacle 30209:** Located at (374.9687, 210.6839). This obstacle is significantly to the right and slightly behind the ego vehicle, posing no immediate threat. Low Risk.

* **Obstacle 30211:** Located at (358.2723, 237.5575). This obstacle is significantly behind and to the left of the ego vehicle, posing no immediate threat. Low Risk.
