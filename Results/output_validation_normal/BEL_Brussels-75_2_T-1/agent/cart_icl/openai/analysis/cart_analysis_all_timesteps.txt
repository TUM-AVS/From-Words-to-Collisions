### Analysis

Let's analyze each obstacle relative to the ego vehicle at the most recent timestep (0.9 seconds), using the provided position, velocity, and orientation data.

#### Obstacle 30207:
- **Position**: (392.0268, 231.4232)
- **Relative Position**: Ahead, at a lateral distance of about 4.37m.
- **Velocity**: 6.1425 m/s, moving parallel but slightly diverging from the ego's path.
- **TTC**: Relatively diverging paths; no immediate risk of collision.
- **Overall Risk Score**: 4 (Low Risk)

#### Obstacle 30208:
- **Position**: (369.3942, 230.9044)
- **Relative Position**: Behind and to the left, with significant lateral separation (> 5m).
- **Velocity**: 6.4296 m/s, moving parallel and slightly slowing.
- **TTC**: Large separation and reducing speed mitigate collision risk.
- **Overall Risk Score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)

#### Obstacle 30209:
- **Position**: (374.9687, 210.6839)
- **Relative Position**: Behind and significantly offset laterally (about 16m).
- **Velocity**: 5.7623 m/s, moving on a diverging path.
- **TTC**: Diverging path and significant lateral gap minimize risk.
- **Overall Risk Score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)

#### Obstacle 30211:
- **Position**: (358.2723, 237.5575)
- **Relative Position**: Behind and off the ego's left with considerable distance.
- **Velocity**: 5.9062 m/s, moving parallel but on a diverging path.
- **TTC**: No immediate risk due to large lateral gap.
- **Overall Risk Score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)

#### Risk Summary
Based on these observations, there are no immediate threats of collision. The relative distances and velocities suggest no current path intersections or critical time-to-collision factors that would increase risk to more than Low or Negligible levels for any obstacle.

### JSON Output

```json
{
    "CollisionObstacles": [],
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {},
    "HighRiskObstacle": {}
}
```

This JSON reflects the conclusion that no obstacles at 0.9 seconds present a high risk or extreme risk that would necessitate immediate action from the ego vehicle.
