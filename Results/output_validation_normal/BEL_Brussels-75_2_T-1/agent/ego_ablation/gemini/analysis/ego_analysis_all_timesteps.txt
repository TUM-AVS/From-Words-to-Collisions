At t=0.9s, Obstacle 30207 is closest to the ego longitudinally at 5.24m, and laterally aligned with the ego vehicle.  However, with a longitudinal relative velocity of -0.67 m/s, the obstacle is moving towards the ego vehicle but slowly. Due to the lateral alignment,  a small deviation in either vehicle's trajectory could lead to a collision. This warrants close monitoring but doesn't present an extreme risk at this moment.

Obstacle 30208 is located at longitudinal -5.90m and lateral 8.40m relative to the ego vehicle, placing it behind and to the left. The relative velocity shows it moving further away longitudinally but towards the ego laterally.  With a distance of ~10m, this poses low risk.

Obstacle 30209 at longitudinal -10.61m and lateral -8.82m is moving away from the ego both longitudinally and laterally, posing no immediate threat.

Obstacle 30211 at longitudinal -12.51m and lateral 19.54m is moving away longitudinally and  towards the ego laterally. However, its significant lateral distance suggests no risk.

Based on the analysis, obstacle 30207 presents the highest risk due to longitudinal proximity and lateral alignment, while all others appear to have a low risk of collision.
