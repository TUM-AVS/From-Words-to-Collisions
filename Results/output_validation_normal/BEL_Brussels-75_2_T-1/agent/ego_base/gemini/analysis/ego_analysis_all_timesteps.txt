At t=0.9s:
- Obstacle 30207: Located in front, longitudinal distance 5.24m, approaching slowly (-0.67 m/s).  Lateral alignment suggests a potential collision if the obstacle or ego vehicle deviates from its current path. Medium Risk (3).
- Obstacle 30208: Located rear-left, longitudinal distance -5.90m, moving away longitudinally. Lateral distance 8.40m and moving towards ego laterally. Low risk (4).
- Obstacle 30209: Located rear-right, longitudinal distance -10.61m, moving away longitudinally. Lateral distance -8.82m and moving towards ego laterally. Low risk (4).
- Obstacle 30211: Located rear-left, longitudinal distance -12.51m, moving away longitudinally. Lateral distance 19.54m and moving towards ego laterally. Negligible risk (5).
