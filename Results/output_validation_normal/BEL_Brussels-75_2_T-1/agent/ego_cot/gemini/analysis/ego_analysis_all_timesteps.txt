### Safety analysis for timestep 0.9s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

**Assumptions and Clarifications:**

* The prompt mentions "adjusted distances" (adjusted_d_long, adjusted_d_lat), but these values are NOT provided in the scenario description. Therefore, the analysis will be performed using the provided real longitudinal (DTClong) and lateral (DTClat) distances.  This analysis would be significantly improved with the adjusted distance values.
* TTC calculations will be simplified due to the lack of adjusted distances.  A proper TTC calculation requires accurate vehicle dimensions and a more precise understanding of the collision point.  This simplified TTC will assume a point-like vehicle.
* Since the provided data shows obstacle motion over time, the latest trends in relative velocity and acceleration are crucial for risk assessment.

**Calculations & Analysis:**

I cannot perform true TTC calculations without adjusted distances and vehicle size.  However, a basic estimate for TTC is provided below.  It's is extremely rudimentary.  **This will not be a reliable metric for this response.**

* **Obstacle 30207:** Front, DTClong: 5.24m, DTClat: 5.24m, Vrel_long: -0.67 m/s, Vrel_lat: 2.40 m/s.  
    * *Distance Risk:*  Moderately safe longitudinally, but lateral movement is increasing separation. Score: 4
    * *Time Risk:* Simplified TTClong: 5.24m / 0.67m/s â‰ˆ 7.8s (very rough, not reliable). Lateral movement suggests no immediate time risk. Score: 4
    * *Overall Risk Score:* 4

* **Obstacle 30208:** Rear-left, DTClong: -5.90m, DTClat: -5.90m, Vrel_long: -3.08 m/s, Vrel_lat: -5.55 m/s.
    * *Distance Risk:*  Safe distance, but lateral velocity is concerning. Score: 3
    * *Time Risk:*  Lateral velocity suggests increasing risk if trends continue. Longitudinal velocity indicates increasing distance. Score: 3
    * *Overall Risk Score:* 3

* **Obstacle 30209:** Rear-right, DTClong: -10.61m, DTClat: -10.61m, Vrel_long: -0.91 m/s, Vrel_lat: 1.98 m/s.
    * *Distance Risk:* Currently safe. Score: 4
    * *Time Risk:* Lateral velocity indicates a potential risk. Score: 4
    * *Overall Risk Score:* 4

* **Obstacle 30211:** Rear-left, DTClong: -12.51m, DTClat: -12.51m, Vrel_long: -3.26 m/s, Vrel_lat: -5.05 m/s.
    * *Distance Risk:* Currently safe. Score: 4
    * *Time Risk:*  Similar to 30208, lateral velocity is a concern. Score: 4
    * *Overall Risk Score:* 4
