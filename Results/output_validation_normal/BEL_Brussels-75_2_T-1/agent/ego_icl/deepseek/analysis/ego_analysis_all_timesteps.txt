Let me analyze each obstacle at the most recent timestep (0.9 seconds):

1. Obstacle 30207 (Front):
- Adjusted distances: longitudinal 5.24m, lateral 0.00m
- Relative velocity: longitudinal -0.67 m/s (approaching), lateral 2.40 m/s (moving away)
- Motion: Driving toward longitudinally, exact lateral alignment
- TTC (longitudinal): 5.24/0.67 = 7.82s (No Risk)
- MDC: Lateral distance is stable/increasing (5.24m longitudinal)
- Risk: 5 (Negligible)

2. Obstacle 30208 (Rear-left):
- Adjusted distances: longitudinal -5.90m, lateral 8.40m
- Relative velocity: longitudinal -3.08 m/s (moving away), lateral -5.55 m/s (approaching)
- Motion: Moving away longitudinally, approaching laterally
- TTC (lateral): 8.40/5.55 = 1.51s (Medium Risk)
- MDC: 8.40m lateral (Low Risk)
- Risk: 3 (Medium) - due to lateral TTC

3. Obstacle 30209 (Rear-right):
- Adjusted distances: longitudinal -10.61m, lateral -8.82m
- Relative velocity: longitudinal -0.91 m/s (moving away), lateral 1.98 m/s (approaching)
- Motion: Moving away longitudinally, approaching laterally
- TTC (lateral): Not applicable (positive relative velocity means moving away)
- MDC: 8.82m lateral (Low Risk)
- Risk: 5 (Negligible)

4. Obstacle 30211 (Rear-left):
- Adjusted distances: longitudinal -12.51m, lateral 19.54m
- Relative velocity: longitudinal -3.26 m/s (moving away), lateral -5.05 m/s (approaching)
- Motion: Moving away longitudinally, approaching laterally
- TTC (lateral): 19.54/5.05 = 3.87s (Low Risk)
- MDC: 19.54m lateral (No Risk)
- Risk: 4 (Low)

Trajectory Analysis:
- No obstacles show collision or extreme risk
- Only medium risk is Obstacle 30208 due to lateral approach (1.51s TTC)
- All other obstacles are either moving away or have sufficient distance
