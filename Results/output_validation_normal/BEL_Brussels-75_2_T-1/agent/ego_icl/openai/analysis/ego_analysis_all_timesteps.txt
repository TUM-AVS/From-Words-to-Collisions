### Analysis of Each Obstacle

#### Obstacle 30207
- **Location**: Front
- **Adjusted Distances**: Longitudinal: 5.24 m, Lateral: 0.00 m
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal: -0.67 m/s, Lateral: 2.40 m/s
- **Motion**: Aligning exactly laterally; moving toward ego car longitudinally.

**Trajectory Analysis**:
- The longitudinal distance is stable, and the lateral alignment does not indicate collision, as the longitudinal distance is significant and longitudinal velocity is slow.
- Trajectory indicates the obstacle is approaching along the same lane.
- **TTC (Longitudinal)**: 5.24 m / 0.67 m/s = 7.81 seconds
- **MDC**: 5.24 m (Longitudinal)

**Risk Assessment**:
- Longitudinal alignment doesn't suggest immediate collision risk.
- MDC > 5.0 m and TTC > 5.0 s indicate negligible risk.
- **Risk Score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)

#### Obstacle 30208
- **Location**: Rear-left
- **Adjusted Distances**: Longitudinal: -5.90 m, Lateral: 8.40 m
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal: -3.08 m/s, Lateral: -5.55 m/s
- **Motion**: Moving away longitudinally, and towards laterally from the left.

**Trajectory Analysis**:
- The obstacle is situated behind and moving away longitudinally.
- Significant lateral distance and negative lateral relative velocity imply no lateral collision risk.
- **TTC (Lateral)**: N/A as lateral path divergence.
- **MDC**: N/A, diverging paths

**Risk Assessment**:
- As the path diverges and lateral convergence is not imminent, there is negligible risk.
- **Risk Score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)

#### Obstacle 30209
- **Location**: Rear-right
- **Adjusted Distances**: Longitudinal: -10.61 m, Lateral: -8.82 m
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal: -0.91 m/s, Lateral: 1.98 m/s
- **Motion**: Moving away longitudinally, slightly approaching laterally from the right.

**Trajectory Analysis**:
- Significant distances and slow velocities indicate no immediate collision threat.
- Approaching laterally does pose minor concern, yet not in a threat range.
- **TTC (Lateral)**: 8.82 m / 1.98 m/s = 4.45 seconds
- **MDC**: Lateral distance before relative velocity change = 8.82 m

**Risk Assessment**:
- Presence of lateral convergence indicates a potential for low risk. Yet, due to distances, it remains minimal.
- **Risk Score**: 4 (Low Risk)

#### Obstacle 30211
- **Location**: Rear-left
- **Adjusted Distances**: Longitudinal: -12.51 m, Lateral: 19.54 m
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal: -3.26 m/s, Lateral: -5.05 m/s
- **Motion**: Moving away longitudinally, very gradual lateral reduction.

**Trajectory Analysis**:
- Safe substantial distance maintains that neither component dominates risk profile.
- Largely divergent path without threat of intercept.
- **MDC**: Not computed, as motion indicates no intersect before 5.0 m mark

**Risk Assessment**:
- No collision aligned scenario in both linear and lateral paths.
- **Risk Score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)

### Conclusion
No obstacles present a high or imminent risk situation based on the most recent observations. The surrounding vehicles continue their separate paths, ensuring negligible to low risk situation prevails in the explored scenario.
