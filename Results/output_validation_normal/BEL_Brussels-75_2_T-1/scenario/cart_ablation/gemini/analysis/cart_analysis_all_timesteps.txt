At t=0.9s, Ego is at (383.3087, 227.0486) in lanelet 1312.0. Let's analyze the obstacles:

* **Obstacle 30207.0:** Located at (392.0268, 231.4232) in lanelet 87.0.  While somewhat close laterally, the y-coordinate difference suggests it's in a different, likely parallel, lane.  The trajectories don't indicate an immediate collision course. Risk level: Medium (3).

* **Obstacle 30208.0:** Located at (369.3942, 230.9044) in lanelet 1311.0. This obstacle is further away from the ego vehicle and poses no immediate threat. Risk level: Low (4).

* **Obstacle 30209.0:**  Located at (374.9687, 210.6839) in lanelet 346.0.  The large difference in the y-coordinate suggests it is in a different, non-intersecting lane and poses no immediate danger. Risk Level: Negligible (5).

* **Obstacle 30211.0:** Located at (358.2723, 237.5575) in lanelet 107.0. This obstacle is also laterally distant and poses no immediate risk. Risk level: Low (4)
