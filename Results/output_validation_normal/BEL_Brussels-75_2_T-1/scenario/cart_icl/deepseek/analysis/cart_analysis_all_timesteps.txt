### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep (0.9 seconds):

### Obstacle Analysis:
1. **Obstacle ID: 30207.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Moving in a parallel lane (lanelet 87.0) with a consistent ~10m longitudinal distance from ego. No lateral overlap.
   - **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: Relative velocity is low (~0.2 m/s), but obstacle is decelerating (-0.6788 m/s²). TTC > 20s.
   - **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 4

2. **Obstacle ID: 30208.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Initially in adjacent lane (1310.0), now moving into ego's lane (1311.0). Distance decreasing (368.8437→369.3942m).
   - **Distance safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: High deceleration (-1.6228 m/s²) but still moving toward ego. TTC ~5s.
   - **Time safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 3

3. **Obstacle ID: 30209.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Moving away laterally (lanelet 346.0) with stable ~17m cross-distance.
   - **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: Nearly parallel trajectory with minimal relative velocity.
   - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 5

4. **Obstacle ID: 30211.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Moving away in opposite direction (lanelet 107.0), distance increasing (357.7604→358.2723m).
   - **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: Negative relative velocity (moving away).
   - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 5

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. No obstacles are in direct collision course (risk score 0).
2. Obstacle 30208.0 shows medium risk due to lane change behavior but is decelerating.
3. All other obstacles are either moving away or maintaining safe distances.
4. Ego vehicle is decelerating (-0.4283→0.1854 m/s²), contributing to risk mitigation.
