### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 30207.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is laterally separated and moving almost parallel to the ego vehicle.  No immediate risk.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason:  Relative velocities suggest the obstacle will remain laterally separated.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- Obstacle ID: 30208.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is moderately far and in a different lanelet.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason:  Relative velocities and varying acceleration make it difficult to definitively assess long-term risk but no immediate concern.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- Obstacle ID: 30209.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is in a different lanelet and poses no immediate threat.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Relative velocities indicate continued separation.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 30211.0
- Distance Risk reason: Located behind and in a different lanelet.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Relative velocities and accelerations show no sign of convergence.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 30212.0
- Distance Risk reason: Located further behind and in a different lanelet.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason:  Trajectory indicates no risk of collision.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 30213.0
- Distance Risk reason: Furthest behind and in a different lanelet.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: No risk based on trajectories.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5


### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
No obstacles are on a direct collision course with the ego vehicle.  Lateral separation and relative velocities suggest no immediate risk. The varying accelerations of some obstacles warrant monitoring, but the current trajectories do not indicate a collision scenario.
