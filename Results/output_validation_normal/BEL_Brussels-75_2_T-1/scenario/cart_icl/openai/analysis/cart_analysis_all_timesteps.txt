### Obstacle Analysis:

#### Obstacle ID: 30207.0
- **Distance Risk Reason**: The obstacle is in lanelet 87, which is different from the ego's lanelet 1312, indicating no immediate collision path. Over the previous timesteps, the obstacle maintained a consistent trajectory that does not directly converge with the ego's path.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 5 
- **Time Risk Reason**: Relative velocity and acceleration are stable, indicating no rapid approach or erratic behavior that increases collision risk.
- **Time Safety Score**: 5
- **Overall Risk Score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 30208.0
- **Distance Risk Reason**: The obstacle is located in lanelet 1311 at the most recent timestep. It is nearby but not in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle. Historically, it has shown a pattern of slight deceleration and consistent lateral positioning.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 4
- **Time Risk Reason**: The direction changes and deceleration over time suggest potential alignment with the ego vehicle's path but at a safe distance and consistent velocity away.
- **Time Safety Score**: 4
- **Overall Risk Score**: 4

#### Obstacle ID: 30209.0
- **Distance Risk Reason**: The obstacle is moving away in lanelet 346, consistently maintaining a southern trajectory away from the ego vehicle. 
- **Distance Safety Score**: 5
- **Time Risk Reason**: Stable relative velocity and distance from the ego vehicle, with no significant speed changes.
- **Time Safety Score**: 5
- **Overall Risk Score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 30211.0
- **Distance Risk Reason**: Positioned in lanelet 107, the obstacle's trajectory is far removed from the ego vehicle's lanelet 1312. Relative orientations suggest divergent paths.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 5
- **Time Risk Reason**: Acceleration and velocity patterns are consistent, without significant risk of convergence with the ego vehicle.
- **Time Safety Score**: 5
- **Overall Risk Score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 30212.0
- **Distance Risk Reason**: The obstacle remains in lanelet 107 and is positioned away from the ego trajectory. Positions have decreased longitudinally.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 5
- **Time Risk Reason**: Consistent velocity trends imply no intersection tendency with the ego vehicle.
- **Time Safety Score**: 5
- **Overall Risk Score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 30213.0
- **Distance Risk Reason**: Positioned in lanelet 107, far from the ego vehicle, with positions maintained away from the ego's trajectory.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 5
- **Time Risk Reason**: Moderate acceleration indicates no abrupt changes in velocity that would lead to a collision trajectory.
- **Time Safety Score**: 5
- **Overall Risk Score**: 5

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
- No obstacles are in the same lanelet or on a collision course based on their trajectories.
- The historical data shows all obstacles are either maintaining or diverging from paths potentially intersecting the ego vehicle, with adequate relative velocities ensuring safe distances.
