Obstacle 30207 is closest to the ego vehicle longitudinally, at 5.24 meters. However, it's moving towards the ego longitudinally at a slow relative velocity of -0.67 m/s and is at the same lateral position as the ego vehicle.  The lateral relative velocity of 2.40 m/s suggests it might be passing in front of the ego vehicle.

Obstacle 30208 is moving away longitudinally but its lateral motion towards the ego from the rear-left and its relatively close proximity (5.90m longitudinally and 8.40m laterally) needs monitoring.

Obstacles 30209 and 30211 are moving away from the ego vehicle both longitudinally and laterally, posing no immediate threat.

Based on the most recent timestep (0.9 seconds), no obstacle poses an immediate collision risk, but obstacle 30207 requires close monitoring due to its longitudinal proximity and converging trajectory.  The scenario is not a collision scenario at this timestep.
