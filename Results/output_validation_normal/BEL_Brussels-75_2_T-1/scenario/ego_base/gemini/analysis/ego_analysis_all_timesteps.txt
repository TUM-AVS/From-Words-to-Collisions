At t=0.9s, Obstacle 30207 is in front of the ego vehicle, approaching longitudinally at -0.67 m/s with a distance of 5.24 m. While it's currently at the same lateral position, its past trajectory suggests it may not remain so. It poses a potential risk if its lateral movement changes towards the ego vehicle.

Obstacle 30208 is rear-left, moving away longitudinally but approaching laterally. At 5.9m longitudinal and 8.4m lateral distance, it poses a low risk in this timestep.

Obstacle 30209 is rear-right, moving away both longitudinally and laterally, posing no immediate risk.

Obstacle 30211 is rear-left, moving away longitudinally but approaching laterally. However, with a lateral distance of 19.54m and longitudinal distance of -12.51m, it presents low risk.

Although obstacle 30207 is approaching the ego vehicle longitudinally, the current distance and relative velocity suggest no immediate collision in the next timestep. Therefore, this scenario does not involve immediate risk of a collision.

While Obstacle 30207 is approaching longitudinally, its current distance and velocity suggest it is not an immediate collision risk.  All other obstacles are moving away longitudinally or are at a safe distance."
