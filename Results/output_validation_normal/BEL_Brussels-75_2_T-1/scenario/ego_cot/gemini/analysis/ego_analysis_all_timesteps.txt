### Safety analysis for timestep 0.9 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

**Assumptions and Clarifications:**

* The prompt mentions "ADJUSTED distances (adjusted_d_long and adjusted_d_lat)." However, these values are not provided in the scenario description.  Therefore, the analysis will be based on the provided `real distance` values (longitudinal and lateral) as a best approximation.
*  TTC calculations require relative acceleration. Constant acceleration is assumed for simplicity, though this might not reflect real-world conditions perfectly.
* A simple TTC calculation is used: `TTC = -relative_velocity / relative_acceleration`. This formula is applicable when the relative acceleration is non-zero. If the relative acceleration is zero, TTC is considered infinite if the relative velocity is moving away, and zero if the relative velocity is towards the ego vehicle.  If both relative velocity and acceleration are zero, TTC is undefined, and assumed to be a large value in a safe direction or a small value toward a collision, based on its distance. 
* Thresholds for TTC and distance will be subjectively determined based on typical vehicle dimensions and safe maneuvering times.



### Obstacle Analysis:

**- Obstacle ID: 30207**
- Distance Risk reason:  Obstacle is in front and relatively close (5.24m longitudinally and laterally). This suggests a potential for collision if the obstacle or ego vehicle's trajectory changes unexpectedly.
- Distance safety score: 3 (Medium Risk)
- Time Risk reason: Requires calculation based on relative velocity and acceleration. Assuming constant acceleration, the fact that the obstacle is closing longitudinally (-0.67 m/s) presents a risk, though it's somewhat mitigated by the lateral movement.
- Time safety score: 3 (Medium Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 3 (Medium Risk)

**- Obstacle ID: 30208**
- Distance Risk reason:  The obstacle is behind the ego vehicle, and the longitudinal distance (-5.90m) indicates moderate risk.  However, the lateral distance is a concern as it's relatively close.
- Distance safety score: 3 (Medium Risk)
- Time Risk reason: The obstacle is moving away longitudinally, but the lateral motion is towards the ego vehicle. More detailed trajectory prediction is required to ascertain the true risk.
- Time safety score: 3 (Medium Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 3 (Medium Risk)

**- Obstacle ID: 30209**
- Distance Risk reason:  The obstacle is behind and relatively far, both longitudinally and laterally (-10.61m).
- Distance safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
- Time Risk reason: Moving away longitudinally, reducing the risk. The lateral motion towards the ego vehicle needs to be monitored but is not immediately critical given the distance.
- Time safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 4 (Low Risk)

**- Obstacle ID: 30211**
- Distance Risk reason:  The obstacle is behind and relatively far from the ego vehicle (-12.51m in both directions).
- Distance safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
- Time Risk reason: The obstacle is moving away longitudinally and slightly towards the ego laterally. The current trajectory and distance suggest minimal risk.
- Time safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 4 (Low Risk)
