### Obstacle-by-Obstacle Analysis (Most Recent Timestep: 0.9 seconds)

#### **Obstacle 30207 (Front of ego car)**
- **Adjusted Distances**: Longitudinal 5.24 m, Lateral 0.00 m  
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal -0.67 m/s (approaching), Lateral 2.40 m/s (moving away)  
- **Motion**: Driving toward ego longitudinally, exact lateral alignment.  
- **Trajectory Analysis**:  
  - Longitudinal distance is decreasing slowly (from 5.38m to 5.24m over 0.9s).  
  - Lateral distance is stable at 0.00m but obstacle is moving away laterally (positive velocity).  
- **TTC Calculation**:  
  - Longitudinal TTC = 5.24 / 0.67 ≈ 7.82 seconds (No Risk, TTC > 5.0s).  
  - Lateral TTC: Not applicable (moving away).  
- **MDC Calculation**:  
  - Lateral MDC = 0.00m (alignment), but obstacle is moving away. No collision risk.  
- **Overall Risk**: **5 (No Risk)**.

#### **Obstacle 30208 (Rear-left of ego car)**
- **Adjusted Distances**: Longitudinal -5.90 m, Lateral 8.40 m  
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal -3.08 m/s (moving away), Lateral -5.55 m/s (approaching)  
- **Motion**: Moving away longitudinally, driving toward ego laterally.  
- **Trajectory Analysis**:  
  - Longitudinal distance is increasing (moving away).  
  - Lateral distance is decreasing rapidly (from 6.14m to 8.40m in 0.4s).  
- **TTC Calculation**:  
  - Lateral TTC = 8.40 / 5.55 ≈ 1.51 seconds (Medium Risk, 1.0 < TTC ≤ 3.0).  
- **MDC Calculation**:  
  - Lateral MDC = 8.40m (Low Risk, MDC > 5.0m).  
- **Overall Risk**: **3 (Medium Risk)**.

  - Lateral distance is decreasing slowly (from -14.59m to -8.82m in 0.4s).  
- **TTC Calculation**:  
  - Lateral TTC = 8.82 / 1.98 ≈ 4.45 seconds (Low Risk, 3.0 < TTC ≤ 5.0).  
- **MDC Calculation**:  
  - Lateral MDC = 8.82m (Low Risk, MDC > 5.0m).  
- **Overall Risk**: **4 (Low Risk)**.

- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal -3.26 m/s (moving away), Lateral -5.05 m/s (approaching)  
- **Motion**: Moving away longitudinally, driving toward ego laterally.  
- **Trajectory Analysis**:  
  - Longitudinal distance is increasing (moving away).  
  - Lateral distance is decreasing (from 13.87m to 19.54m in 0.4s).  
- **TTC Calculation**:  
  - Lateral TTC = 19.54 / 5.05 ≈ 3.87 seconds (Low Risk, 3.0 < TTC ≤ 5.0).  
- **MDC Calculation**:  
  - Lateral MDC = 19.54m (No Risk, MDC > 5.0m).  
- **Overall Risk**: **4 (Low Risk)**.

### Collision Scenario Determination
- **No obstacle has a risk score of 0 (Collision) or 1 (Extreme Risk)**.  
- The highest risk is **Medium Risk (3)** from Obstacle 30208, but it is not imminent.  
- **This is NOT a collision scenario**.
