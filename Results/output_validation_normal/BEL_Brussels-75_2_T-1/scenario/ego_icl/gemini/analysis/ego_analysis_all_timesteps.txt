* **Obstacle 30207 (Front):** This obstacle is directly in front of the ego vehicle, with a lateral distance of 0.00m at the last timestep.  The longitudinal distance has fluctuated slightly around 5.3 meters across the timesteps but shows a general decreasing trend in the last few steps. The lateral velocity is positive (moving away from ego), but the longitudinal velocity is negative (towards the ego) and decreasing in magnitude, meaning obstacle 30207 is approaching slower. Given the near-zero lateral distance and decreasing longitudinal distance, even though the rate is small, the MDC is considered to be low. TTC calculation for the longitudinal component (most important here): 5.24m / 0.67m/s â‰ˆ 7.8s. This suggests a low risk longitudinally.  However, the consistent near-zero lateral position and overall decreasing longitudinal trend keeps this at medium risk due to the potential for lateral drift or errors.

* **Obstacle 30208 (Rear-Left):** This obstacle is behind and to the left of the ego vehicle, with increasing longitudinal and lateral distances. The motion description indicates it is moving away longitudinally but towards the ego laterally. However, the distances are sufficiently large and increasing in the last two steps.  The increasing distances suggest diverging trajectories. MDC is approximately 8.40m and TTC is very high given the negative and growing longitudinal distance, indicating no risk.

* **Obstacle 30209 (Rear-Right):** This obstacle is behind and to the right and moving away from the ego vehicle in both directions (increasing negative distances). Thus MDC is large (>10 meters) and TTC will be large (not applicable). This poses no collision risk.

* **Obstacle 30211 (Rear-Left):** Similar to obstacle 30208, this obstacle is behind and to the left, moving away with increasing distances. This poses no risk.


**Collision Scenario Determination:** No obstacle has a risk score of 0 or 1. Therefore, this is NOT a collision scenario.
