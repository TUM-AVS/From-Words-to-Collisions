Based on the most recent timestep (0.9 seconds) and using the adjusted distances for precise risk assessment, we analyze each obstacle in the scenario:

### Obstacle Analysis

#### Obstacle 30207 (Front of the ego car)
- **Adjusted Longitudinal Distance**: 5.24 m
- **Adjusted Lateral Distance**: 0.00 m
- **Relative Longitudinal Velocity**: -0.67 m/s (approaching)
- **Relative Lateral Velocity**: 2.40 m/s (moving away to the right)

**Trajectory**:
- At 0.9 seconds, the obstacle is at 5.24 m longitudinally and aligned laterally.
- The obstacle is slowly approaching with diminishing longitudinal speed but moving away laterally.

**Calculations**:
- **TTC (Longitudinal)** ≈ 5.24 m / 0.67 m/s ≈ 7.82 s
- **MDC**: Considering zero lateral distance and approaching behavior, projected as 0.0 m despite large longitudinal buffer.

**Risk Assessment**:
- Longitudinal direction is not of immediate concern due to adequate distance and reducing velocity.
- Exact lateral alignment suggests MDC could be critical if motion projection isn't considered, but current longitudinal buffer is significant.
- **Risk Level**: **3 (Medium Risk)**, given exact lateral alignment and considering trajectory.

#### Obstacle 30208 (Rear-left of the ego car)
- **Adjusted Longitudinal Distance**: -5.90 m
- **Adjusted Lateral Distance**: 8.40 m
- **Relative Longitudinal Velocity**: -3.08 m/s (moving away)
- **Relative Lateral Velocity**: -5.55 m/s (approaching)

**Trajectory**:
- Moving away longitudinally but closing from the side.

**Calculations**:
- **TTC (Lateral)** ≈ 8.40 m / 5.55 m/s ≈ 1.51 s
- **MDC**: 8.40 m laterally, will decrease as obstacle continues laterally towards ego

**Risk Assessment**:
- Lateral movement requires monitoring; however, the trajectory implies a high risk given near-alignment in a short time.
- **Risk Level**: **3 (Medium Risk)** due to limited threat longitudinally but requiring side awareness.

#### Obstacle 30209 (Rear-right of the ego car)
- **Adjusted Longitudinal Distance**: -10.61 m
- **Adjusted Lateral Distance**: 8.82 m
- **Relative Longitudinal Velocity**: -0.91 m/s (moving away)
- **Relative Lateral Velocity**: 1.98 m/s (moving away)

**Trajectory**:
- Continuously moving laterally away from ego.

**Calculations**:
- **MDC**: Not critical as trajectory steers away vertically and horizontally.
- **TTC**: Irrelevant due to trajectories diverging.

**Risk Assessment**:
- No immediate trajectory concern.
- **Risk Level**: **5 (No Risk)**

#### Obstacle 30211 (Rear-left of the ego car)
- **Adjusted Longitudinal Distance**: -12.51 m
- **Adjusted Lateral Distance**: 19.54 m
- **Relative Longitudinal Velocity**: -3.26 m/s (moving away)
- **Relative Lateral Velocity**: -5.05 m/s (approaching)

**Trajectory**:
- Moving away longitudinally but slightly converging laterally, though with a significant initial lateral clearance.

**Calculations**:
- **TTC (Lateral)** ≈ 19.54 m / 5.05 m/s ≈ 3.87 s
- **MDC**: Large buffer maintained laterally.

**Risk Assessment**:
- Plenty of lateral distance prevents immediate collision risk.
- **Reduction of risk level**: **4 (Low Risk)**

### Conclusion
None of the obstacles indicate a collision or extreme risk on final step analysis based on calculated TTC and MDC. Given trajectories and current distances, there is **no immediate collision scenario**.
