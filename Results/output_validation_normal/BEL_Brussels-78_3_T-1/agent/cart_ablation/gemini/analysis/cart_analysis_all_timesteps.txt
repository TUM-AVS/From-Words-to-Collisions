The ego vehicle (30214.0) is accelerating and moving in roughly the same direction as obstacles 30218.0 and 30219.0.  All are in the same lanelet (503.0).

Obstacle 30218.0 is the closest to the ego vehicle.  Over the provided time steps, the distance between the ego vehicle and obstacle 30218.0 is decreasing, indicating a potential collision risk.  Obstacle 30219.0 is farther away and poses less of an immediate risk, though its position and velocity should still be monitored.  

While the provided data shows a decreasing distance between ego and obstacle 30218.0, it's not definitive enough to declare an immediate, unavoidable collision (risk score 0 or 1).  More data points, especially about the lateral positioning within the lanelet, would be needed for a more confident risk assessment. For now, we will classify obstacle 30218.0 as a high risk (2) due to decreasing distance and same lane occupancy.
