At t=0.9s, the ego vehicle is at (-148.5902, -278.5657) with a velocity of 5.1034 m/s and acceleration of 0.7713 m/sÂ².  We'll analyze the risk posed by obstacles 30218 and 30219.

**Obstacle 30218:**

* Position: (-158.975, -281.2235)
* Velocity: 3.5929 m/s
* Relative Position: (-10.3848, -2.6578)  (approximately 10.7m diagonally behind and to the left of ego)
* Relative Velocity:  Ego is moving faster. It's also turning slightly more to the right than previous timestamps (change in orientation is less positive than previous timestamps) so lateral relative velocity will be smaller than a simpler estimate.  However, the longitudinal component of relative velocity shows ego pulling away.
* Risk Assessment: Although the obstacle is fairly close, the ego vehicle is moving faster in the same lane and appears to be pulling away both longitudinally and laterally. It appears that if ego is overtaking it is also passing so the lateral relative velocity is also positive as it's passing obstacle 30218. It should be monitored, however, it does not immediately pose a safety risk.

**Obstacle 30219:**

* Position: (-168.9588, -283.0493)
* Velocity: 2.909 m/s
* Relative Position: (-20.3686, -4.4836) (approximately 20.8m diagonally behind and to the left of ego)
* Relative Velocity: Ego is traveling faster and pulling away from obstacle 30219, so there is unlikely risk of collision
* Risk Assessment: This obstacle is further away than 30218 and poses even less of a risk.
