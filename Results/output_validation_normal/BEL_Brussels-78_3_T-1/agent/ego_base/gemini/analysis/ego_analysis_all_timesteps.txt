At t=0.9s:
- Obstacle 30218 is 6.21m behind the ego vehicle, moving away at 1.51 m/s longitudinally and -0.17 m/s laterally.  The lateral movement is slight and the longitudinal movement is away from the ego vehicle. This obstacle poses negligible risk.

- Obstacle 30219 is 16.33m behind the ego vehicle, moving away at 2.21 m/s longitudinally and -0.31 m/s laterally. Similar to Obstacle 30218, the lateral movement is negligible and the longitudinal movement indicates increasing distance from the ego vehicle. This obstacle poses negligible risk as well.

Therefore, no obstacles pose a high risk or higher.
