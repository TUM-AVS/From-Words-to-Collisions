### Obstacle-by-Obstacle Analysis

#### Obstacle 30218
- **Position**: Behind ego car (longitudinal distance: -6.21 m, lateral distance: 0.00 m)
- **Relative Velocity**: longitudinal -1.51 m/s (moving away), lateral -0.17 m/s (moving away)
- **Motion Description**: Obstacle is moving away longitudinally. Exact lateral alignment or unknown case.
- **Trajectory Analysis**: Across all timesteps, the longitudinal distance is increasing (from -5.46 m to -6.21 m), indicating the obstacle is moving away from the ego vehicle. The lateral distance remains 0.00 m, but the lateral velocity is negative, meaning the obstacle is moving away laterally as well.
- **TTC Calculation**: Not applicable (negative relative velocity in both dimensions, paths diverging).
- **MDC Calculation**: The minimum distance is the longitudinal distance (6.21 m), which is > 5.0 m.
- **Risk Assessment**: 
  - Longitudinal: No Risk (5)
  - Lateral: No Risk (5)
  - **Overall Risk Score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)

#### Obstacle 30219
- **Position**: Behind ego car (longitudinal distance: -16.33 m, lateral distance: 0.00 m)
- **Relative Velocity**: longitudinal -2.21 m/s (moving away), lateral -0.31 m/s (moving away)
- **Motion Description**: Obstacle is moving away longitudinally. Exact lateral alignment or unknown case.
- **Trajectory Analysis**: Across all timesteps, the longitudinal distance is increasing (from -15.17 m to -16.33 m), indicating the obstacle is moving away from the ego vehicle. The lateral distance remains 0.00 m, but the lateral velocity is negative, meaning the obstacle is moving away laterally as well.
- **TTC Calculation**: Not applicable (negative relative velocity in both dimensions, paths diverging).
- **MDC Calculation**: The minimum distance is the longitudinal distance (16.33 m), which is > 5.0 m.
- **Risk Assessment**: 
  - Longitudinal: No Risk (5)
  - Lateral: No Risk (5)
  - **Overall Risk Score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)

### JSON Summary
```json
{
    "CollisionObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": null,
        "OverallRiskScore": null
    },
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": null,

    }
}
```

### Explanation
- Neither obstacle poses any risk of collision or extreme/high risk. Both obstacles are moving away from the ego vehicle in both longitudinal and lateral dimensions, with distances well above the thresholds for any significant risk. The JSON summary reflects that there are no collision, extreme risk, or high risk obstacles in the scenario.
