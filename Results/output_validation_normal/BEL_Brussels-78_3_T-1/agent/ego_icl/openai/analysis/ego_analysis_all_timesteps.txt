To analyze the risk of collision for the given obstacles, we'll focus on the most recent timestep (0.9 seconds) and consider the adjusted distances along with the relative velocities to determine time-to-collision (TTC) and minimum distance to collision (MDC).

### Obstacle 30218 Analysis (Most Recent Timestep):

1. **Position and Trajectory:**
   - **Adjusted Longitudinal Distance:** -6.21 meters
   - **Adjusted Lateral Distance:** 0.00 meters
   - **Relative Velocity:** Longitudinal -1.51 m/s, Lateral -0.17 m/s
   - **Motion Description:** "Obstacle is moving away longitudinally."

2. **TTC and MDC Calculation:**
   - **Longitudinal TTC:** As the obstacle is moving away, TTC is not applicable for collision.
   - **Longitudinal MDC:** Since the longitudinal distance is increasing and the obstacle is moving away, MDC is greater than the critical distances for collision risk.

3. **Risk Assessment:**
   - With the obstacle moving away and increasing longitudinal distance, there's no immediate collision risk.
   - **Overall Risk Score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)

### Obstacle 30219 Analysis (Most Recent Timestep):

1. **Position and Trajectory:**
   - **Adjusted Longitudinal Distance:** -16.33 meters
   - **Adjusted Lateral Distance:** 0.00 meters
   - **Relative Velocity:** Longitudinal -2.21 m/s, Lateral -0.31 m/s
   - **Motion Description:** "Obstacle is moving away longitudinally."

2. **TTC and MDC Calculation:**
   - **Longitudinal TTC:** As this obstacle is also moving away, TTC is not applicable for collision.
   - **Longitudinal MDC:** Since the longitudinal distance is increasing and the obstacle is moving further behind, the MDC is well beyond any immediate collision concern.

3. **Risk Assessment:**
   - Similar to obstacle 30218, this obstacle is in a diverging path scenario with sufficient separation.
   - **Overall Risk Score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)

### Conclusion:

Both obstacles 30218 and 30219 are moving away from the ego vehicle with increasing longitudinal distances. There is no immediate collision risk for either obstacle. The relative velocities confirm diverging paths, indicating negligible risk.

### JSON Summary:

```json
{
    "CollisionObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "None",
        "OverallRiskScore": "0"
    },
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "None",
        "OverallRiskScore": "1"
    },
    "HighRiskObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "None",
        "OverallRiskScore": "2"
    }
}
```

In this scenario, both obstacles are considered negligible risk based on the metrics and trajectory outlined.
