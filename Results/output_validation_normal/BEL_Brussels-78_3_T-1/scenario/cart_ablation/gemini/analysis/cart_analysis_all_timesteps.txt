At t=0.9s, Ego is at (-148.5902, -278.5657) with a velocity of 5.1034 m/s.

Obstacle 30218 is at (-158.975, -281.2235) with a velocity of 3.5929 m/s.  The distance between Ego and Obstacle 30218 is approximately 10.4 meters. Given the velocities and closing distance, a collision is not imminent in the next few tenths of a second, but the risk is high given the relatively small separation and the fact that both are moving in roughly the same direction within the same lanelet. This situation requires monitoring.

Obstacle 30219 is at (-168.9588, -283.0493), significantly further behind obstacle 30218. While in the same lanelet, it poses less immediate risk than 30218.

Since no collision is imminent in the very next time step, but obstacle 30218 presents a high risk scenario, the JSON output reflects this with an empty CollisionObstacles array and a null ExtremeRiskObstacle.

```json
{
  "CollisionObstacles": [],
  "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null,
  "ScenarioAnalysis": {
    "IsCollisionScenario": false,
    "Reasoning": "No immediate collision detected at t=0.9s, but Obstacle 30218 presents a high risk due to proximity and same-direction movement within the same lanelet as Ego. Continuous monitoring needed."
  }
}
```
