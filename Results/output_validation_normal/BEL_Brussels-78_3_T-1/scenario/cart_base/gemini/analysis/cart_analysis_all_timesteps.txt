At t=0.9s, Ego is at (-148.5902, -278.5657) with a velocity of 5.1034 m/s.

Obstacle 30218 is at (-158.975, -281.2235) with a velocity of 3.5929 m/s.  The x-positions are converging, but the y-difference suggests they are in different parts of the lane, lessening immediate risk. Based on the trajectories, a risk score of 2 (High Risk) seems appropriate, as further observation is needed to determine if evasive action is necessary.

Obstacle 30219 is at (-168.9588, -283.0493) with a velocity of 2.909 m/s.  This obstacle is further away from the ego vehicle and poses less of an immediate risk. We assign a risk score of 3 (Medium Risk).

Since no obstacle poses an immediate collision risk (score 0 or 1) at the most recent timestep,  IsCollisionScenario is false.

```json
{
    "CollisionObstacles": [],
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null,
    "ScenarioAnalysis": {
        "IsCollisionScenario": false,
        "Reasoning": "No obstacles pose an immediate collision risk at t=0.9s. Obstacle 30218 is approaching but the y-difference suggests different lane positions.  Further monitoring needed."
    }
}
```
