### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 30218.0
- Distance Risk reason: At t=0.9s, Obstacle 30218.0 is at (-158.975, -281.2235) and Ego is at (-148.5902, -278.5657).  The distance is approximately 10.6 meters. While in the same lane, the obstacle's trajectory over the past 0.9 seconds indicates a relatively stable longitudinal separation. No immediate collision risk.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: The Ego vehicle is traveling faster than the obstacle and increasing the distance between them over each timestep. The trends suggest this will continue, further decreasing the risk.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- Obstacle ID: 30219.0
- Distance Risk reason: At t=0.9s, Obstacle 30219.0 is at (-168.9588, -283.0493) and Ego is at (-148.5902, -278.5657). The distance is approximately 20.5 meters and itâ€™s behind Obstacle 30218, and therefore further from the Ego vehicle.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: The Ego vehicle is further separating from Obstacle 30219.0 each timestep with a safe lateral and longitudinal distances based on the last few timestamps.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5


### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. **Most critical obstacle:** Obstacle 30218.0 poses the most immediate risk due to being closer, though still at a safe distance, and within the same lane as the ego vehicle. Obstacle 30219.0 is further away and less critical currently.
2. **Trajectory analysis:** Over the 10 timesteps, both obstacles maintain a relatively straight trajectory within the same lane.  The Ego vehicle also maintains a straight trajectory in the same lane but traveling at a higher velocity than the other obstacles.
3. **Relative positions, velocities, and accelerations:** The ego vehicle is moving faster than both obstacles, and the distance between them is increasing, thus reducing collision risk over time. Though there are some fluctuations in acceleration, they don't suggest imminent collision.
4. **Collision determination:** No collision has occurred or is predicted based on the current trajectory and velocities.
5. **Reasoning:** Although the vehicles are in the same lane and have a velocity difference, the ego vehicle maintains sufficient separation and is moving away from obstacles.
