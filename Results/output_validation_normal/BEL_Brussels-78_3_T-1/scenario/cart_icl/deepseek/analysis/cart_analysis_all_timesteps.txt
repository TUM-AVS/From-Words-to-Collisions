### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep:

### Obstacle Analysis:
#### Obstacle ID: 30218.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is ~10.4m ahead of the ego vehicle in the same lanelet (503.0). Over the past 9 timesteps, the distance has been decreasing but remains significant (~10-11m). The ego is accelerating faster than the obstacle, but the gap is still large.
- **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
- **Time Risk reason**: Relative velocity is ~1.5 m/s (ego: 5.1 m/s, obstacle: 3.6 m/s). TTC = 10.4/1.5 ≈ 6.9s. The obstacle is accelerating, but the TTC is sufficiently high.
- **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
- **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low Risk)

#### Obstacle ID: 30219.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is ~20.4m ahead of the ego vehicle in the same lanelet (503.0). The distance has been decreasing but remains very large (~20-21m over the past 9 timesteps).
- **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- **Time Risk reason**: Relative velocity is ~2.2 m/s (ego: 5.1 m/s, obstacle: 2.9 m/s). TTC = 20.4/2.2 ≈ 9.3s. The obstacle is accelerating slightly, but the TTC is very high.
- **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- **Overall Risk score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. **Lanelet Check**: All vehicles (ego, 30218.0, 30219.0) are in lanelet 503.0, so they share a trajectory.
2. **Distance Trends**: Both obstacles are ahead of the ego, with distances decreasing but still large (>10m for 30218.0, >20m for 30219.0).
3. **Velocity/Acceleration**: Ego is accelerating faster than both obstacles, but the relative velocities do not yet pose an immediate threat due to the large initial distances.
4. **TTC Analysis**: Both TTC values are high (>6s), indicating no urgent collision risk.
5. **Conclusion**: No collision or extreme risk is present at the current timestep.
