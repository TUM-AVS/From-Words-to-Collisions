### Safety Analysis for the Most Recent Timestep:

#### Obstacle 30213:
- **Distance Risk Reason**: The obstacle is in lanelet 76.0 and has maintained a consistent distance from the ego, indicating negligible threat. Its trajectory hasn't shown any signs of crossing towards the ego's path from its current position.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 5
- **Time Risk Reason**: The velocity and acceleration trends show no significant risk of convergence towards the ego. The obstacle is moving steadily with small variations.
- **Time Safety Score**: 5
- **Overall Risk Score**: 5

#### Obstacle 30215:
- **Distance Risk Reason**: Similarly, located in lanelet 76.0, this obstacle does not pose an immediate distance risk given its consistent trajectory away from the ego.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 5
- **Time Risk Reason**: The obstacle's velocity has slightly fluctuated, but it remains non-threatening as it doesn't indicate potential intersection with the ego's path.
- **Time Safety Score**: 5
- **Overall Risk Score**: 5

#### Obstacle 30216:
- **Distance Risk Reason**: Placed in lanelet 76.0, this obstacle's positioning has consistently been distant and not on a collision path.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 5
- **Time Risk Reason**: The stable trajectory and gradual changes in velocity suggest it is maintaining a safe separate path from the ego.
- **Time Safety Score**: 5
- **Overall Risk Score**: 5

#### Obstacle 30217:
- **Distance Risk Reason**: Initially closer compared to others, now moving away and in a separate lanelet (1287.0) towards a different direction.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 5
- **Time Risk Reason**: Its acceleration pattern has shown negative values indicating deceleration, and now it's accelerating in another lane.
- **Time Safety Score**: 5
- **Overall Risk Score**: 5

#### Obstacle 30218:
- **Distance Risk Reason**: Obstacle is in the same lanelet (503.0) but consistently behind the ego vehicle with increasing distance, posing a minimal risk.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 4
- **Time Risk Reason**: The velocity trend is increasing but due to the considerable and increasing gap, immediate collision likelihood is low.
- **Time Safety Score**: 4
- **Overall Risk Score**: 4

#### Obstacle 30219:
- **Distance Risk Reason**: This obstacle is trailing the ego at a distant position, continuously in lanelet 503.0 without significant proximity changes.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 5
- **Time Risk Reason**: Although its velocity increases are notable, the separation remains sufficient to preclude urgent collision concerns.
- **Time Safety Score**: 5
- **Overall Risk Score**: 5

#### Obstacle 30220:
- **Distance Risk Reason**: Positioned in lanelet 76.0, remaining distant and non-intersecting with the ego's trajectory.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 5
- **Time Risk Reason**: Stable velocities with neither risk of convergence nor network into the ego's trajectory.
- **Time Safety Score**: 5
- **Overall Risk Score**: 5

#### Obstacle 30221:
- **Distance Risk Reason**: Positioned in lanelet 503.0 like the ego but significantly behind it, thereby precluding immediate danger.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 4
- **Time Risk Reason**: The trend showcases steady velocity without proximity escalation to the ego.
- **Time Safety Score**: 4
- **Overall Risk Score**: 4

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
This scenario is not a collision scenario. All obstacles are either moving in their own lanes without deviation towards the ego, or they are maintaining a stable distance without proximity escalation due to their consistent velocities and orientations.
