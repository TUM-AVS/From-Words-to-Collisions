At t=0.9s, both obstacles 30218 and 30219 are behind the ego vehicle and moving away. Obstacle 30218 is at a longitudinal distance of -6.21m and lateral distance of 0.00m. Obstacle 30219 is further away at -16.33m longitudinally and 0.00m laterally.  Both obstacles pose no immediate risk.

**Risk Levels and Definitions:**
<Collision (Score: 0)>: Actual collision has occurred or is unavoidable within the next timestep.
<Extreme Risk (Score: 1)>: Immediate collision or very high likelihood of impact. Urgent action is required.
<High Risk (Score: 2)>: Close to collision or highly probable collision path. Needs prompt attention and quick manoeuvring.
<Medium Risk (Score: 3)>: Moderate collision risk but manageable with timely reactions and proper strategies.
<Low Risk (Score: 4)>: Minimal collision risk. The situation is controllable with sufficient time to react.
<Negligible Risk (Score: 5)>: No significant collision risk. Obstacles are either moving away or far enough not to interfere.
