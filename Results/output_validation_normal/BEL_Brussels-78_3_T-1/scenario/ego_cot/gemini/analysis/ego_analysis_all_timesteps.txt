### Safety analysis for timestep 0.9 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 30218**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 30218 is behind the ego vehicle at a longitudinal distance of -6.21m and a lateral distance of -6.21m.  The negative longitudinal distance indicates it's behind the ego vehicle.  Given its position and the fact that it's moving away longitudinally, there is no immediate distance-based risk.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Since the obstacle is moving away from the ego vehicle, there is no risk of collision in the foreseeable future. Thus, TTC is not a relevant factor in this case.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 30219**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 30219 is behind the ego vehicle at a longitudinal distance of -16.33m and a lateral distance of -16.33m. The negative longitudinal distance indicates it's behind the ego vehicle. Given its position and the fact that it's moving away longitudinally, there is no immediate distance-based risk.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Since the obstacle is moving away from the ego vehicle, there is no risk of collision in the foreseeable future. Thus, TTC is not a relevant factor in this case.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5
