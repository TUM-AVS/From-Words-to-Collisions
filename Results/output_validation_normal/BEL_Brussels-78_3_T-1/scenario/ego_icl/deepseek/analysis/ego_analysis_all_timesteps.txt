### Obstacle-by-Obstacle Analysis (Most Recent Timestep: 0.9 seconds)

#### **Obstacle 30218**
- **Position**: Behind ego (longitudinal -6.21m, lateral 0.00m)
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal -1.51 m/s (moving away), Lateral -0.17 m/s (minimal lateral movement)
- **Motion Description**: "Obstacle is moving away longitudinally. Exact lateral alignment or unknown case."
- **Trajectory Analysis**:
  - Longitudinal distance increases from -5.46m to -6.21m over 0.9s (consistent movement away).
  - Lateral distance remains 0.00m (aligned but no convergence).
- **TTC Calculation**:
  - Longitudinal: Not applicable (relative velocity is negative, moving away).
  - Lateral: Not applicable (relative velocity is minimal and not converging).
- **MDC Calculation**:
  - Lateral distance is 0.00m, but trajectories are diverging longitudinally.
  - No collision path exists (MDC effectively infinite as distance increases).
- **Risk Assessment**:
  - **MDC-based**: No Risk (5) – Distance increasing.
  - **TTC-based**: No Risk (5) – No convergence.
  - **Overall Risk**: 5 (No Risk).

#### **Obstacle 30219**
- **Position**: Behind ego (longitudinal -16.33m, lateral 0.00m)
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal -2.21 m/s (moving away), Lateral -0.31 m/s (minimal lateral movement)
- **Motion Description**: "Obstacle is moving away longitudinally. Exact lateral alignment or unknown case."
- **Trajectory Analysis**:
  - Longitudinal distance increases from -15.17m to -16.33m over 0.9s (consistent movement away).
  - Lateral distance remains 0.00m (aligned but no convergence).
- **TTC Calculation**:
  - Longitudinal: Not applicable (relative velocity is negative, moving away).
  - Lateral: Not applicable (relative velocity is minimal and not converging).
- **MDC Calculation**:
  - Lateral distance is 0.00m, but trajectories are diverging longitudinally.
  - No collision path exists (MDC effectively infinite as distance increases).
- **Risk Assessment**:
  - **MDC-based**: No Risk (5) – Distance increasing.
  - **TTC-based**: No Risk (5) – No convergence.
  - **Overall Risk**: 5 (No Risk).

### **Collision Scenario Determination**
- Neither obstacle poses a collision risk (both have **Overall Risk = 5**).
- Both obstacles are moving away longitudinally with stable lateral alignment (no convergence).
- No collision or extreme risk conditions are met.
