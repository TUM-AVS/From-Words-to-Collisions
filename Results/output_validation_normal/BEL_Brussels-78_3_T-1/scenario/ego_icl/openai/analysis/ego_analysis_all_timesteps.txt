Given the provided data, let's analyze the risk for both obstacles at the most recent timestep (0.9 seconds):

### Obstacle 30218 Analysis
- **Position at 0.9 seconds:**
  - Adjusted longitudinal distance: -6.21 m
  - Adjusted lateral distance: 0.00 m
  - Relative velocity: longitudinal -1.51 m/s, lateral -0.17 m/s
  - Relative acceleration: longitudinal 0.78 m/s², lateral 0.13 m/s²
  - Motion: Obstacle is moving away longitudinally; exact lateral alignment.

- **Trajectory:**
  - The obstacle consistently moves away from the ego vehicle, as the longitudinal distance is increasing over time.
  - Lateral alignment indicates no approaching risk laterally; however, the longitudinal dimension indicates divergence.

- **Time-to-Collision (TTC):**
  - **Longitudinal TTC** cannot be calculated meaningfully because the relative velocity indicates moving away.
  - **Lateral TTC** is not applicable as lateral alignment is stable and obstacle is beginning to move away with positive acceleration.

- **Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC):**
  - Given it is moving away, the MDC continues to increase beyond current distance as neither the longitudinal nor the lateral is decreasing.

- **Risk Assessment:**
  - Longitudinally moving away with increasing distance, thus no risk of collision.
  - **Overall Risk Score for Obstacle 30218**: 5 (No Risk)

### Obstacle 30219 Analysis
- **Position at 0.9 seconds:**
  - Adjusted longitudinal distance: -16.33 m
  - Adjusted lateral distance: 0.00 m
  - Relative velocity: longitudinal -2.21 m/s, lateral -0.31 m/s
  - Relative acceleration: longitudinal -0.03 m/s², lateral -0.09 m/s²
  - Motion: Obstacle is moving away longitudinally; exact lateral alignment.

- **Trajectory:**
  - Similar to obstacle 30218, obstacle 30219 is also moving away.
  - Longitudinal distance is increasing, indicating non-converging paths.

- **Time-to-Collision (TTC):**
  - **Longitudinal TTC** is not applicable, as the relative velocity and ongoing divergence make collision impossible.
  - **Lateral TTC** is not applicable for the same reasons as above.

- **Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC):**
  - The MDC similarly increases with the distance, confirming no risk of collision.

- **Risk Assessment:**
  - The increasing separation with no potential for convergence confirms low risk.
  - **Overall Risk Score for Obstacle 30219**: 5 (No Risk)

### Summary of Scenario
After assessing both obstacles 30218 and 30219, neither poses a risk due to distances consistently increasing and velocities indicating movement away from the ego vehicle. No signs of trajectory convergence or extreme proximity are detected.

### Conclusion
- **Is this a Collision Scenario?** No.
- Both obstacles present an "Overall Risk Score" of 5, indicating no risk of collision.
