Obstacle 30183 is in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle and initially poses a potential risk.  The x-position of the obstacle is approximately 17 meters ahead of the ego vehicle at t=0.1s. However, Obstacle 30183 is slowing down rapidly (negative acceleration) and comes to a complete stop by t=0.3s.  The ego vehicle is also decelerating. The consistent deceleration of both, and the stationary nature of obstacle 30183 in later timesteps significantly reduces the collision risk.

Obstacle 30182 is in a different lanelet (864) than the ego vehicle (697) and remains stationary throughout the provided timeframe. Given the different lanelets and lack of motion from the obstacle, the collision risk is negligible.

Obstacle 30186 appears at t=0.5s and is also in a different lanelet (864) than the ego vehicle (697).  While this obstacle is moving, the separate lanelets suggest a low risk, assuming lanelet 864 does not intersect with the ego vehicle's path in the near future. More information about the road geometry and lanelets is needed to definitively assess the risk posed by this obstacle.
