Obstacle 30183 is in the same lane as the ego vehicle and initially poses a potential risk.  At t=0.1s, it's approximately 16 meters ahead and decelerating rapidly. By t=0.3s, it comes to a complete stop, remaining stationary thereafter.  While initially a concern, the rapid deceleration of Obstacle 30183 and the ego vehicle's braking suggest a high risk that has transitioned to a low risk by t=0.4s and negligible by t=0.5 seconds.

Obstacle 30182 is in a different lane (864) and remains stationary throughout the provided timeframe.  Given its position and the ego vehicle's trajectory, it does not pose a collision risk.

Obstacle 30186 appears at t=0.5s in lane 864, the same lane as Obstacle 30182, and is moving with a velocity of 3.7375 m/s while decelerating. At this point, it is distant from the ego vehicle and doesn't present an immediate risk.  Further observation is needed to determine its trajectory and potential future risk.

Given the current data, no obstacle presents a collision risk. Obstacle 30183 presented a high risk, which is now mitigated.
