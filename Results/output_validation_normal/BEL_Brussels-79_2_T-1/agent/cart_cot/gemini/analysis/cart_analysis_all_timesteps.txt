At t=0.9s, the ego vehicle is at (306.1008, 267.1628) with a velocity of 3.4954 and heading -0.4829688758565182. Let's analyze the risk posed by each obstacle:

**Obstacle 30182.0:** Stationary at (328.8969, 263.7877). This obstacle is in a different lanelet (864.0) than the ego vehicle (697.0).  While there's lateral separation due to lane markings, the longitudinal distance is approximately 22.7961 meters along the x-axis and -3.3751 meters along the y-axis.  Given the ego vehicle's deceleration and the static nature of the obstacle, the risk of collision is negligible.

**Obstacle 30183.0:** Stationary at (319.1313, 260.164). This obstacle is in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle. The longitudinal distance is approximately 13.0305 meters, and the lateral distance is approximately -7.00 meters. Given the ego vehicle's speed and deceleration, there is sufficient time and space to avoid a collision. Although closer than Obstacle 30182.0, this obstacle still presents a low risk.

**Obstacle 30186.0:** Located at (332.7369, 274.1085) with a velocity of 2.9175 and heading -1.9269 and is in lanelet 864. This obstacle is also in a different lanelet than the ego vehicle. The longitudinal distance is about 26.6361 along the x-axis and the lateral distance is about 6.9457 along the y-axis. Considering the different lanelets, the lateral separation, and the ego vehicle's trajectory, the collision risk is low.

**Risk Assessment Summary:**

* **Obstacle 30182.0:** Low Risk (Score 4).  Different lanelet, significant longitudinal separation, stationary obstacle.
* **Obstacle 30183.0:** Low Risk (Score 4). Same lanelet, safe longitudinal separation, stationary obstacle. Ego vehicle is decelerating.
* **Obstacle 30186.0:** Low Risk (Score 4). Different lanelet, significant longitudinal separation, moving obstacle, but not towards ego vehicle's path.
