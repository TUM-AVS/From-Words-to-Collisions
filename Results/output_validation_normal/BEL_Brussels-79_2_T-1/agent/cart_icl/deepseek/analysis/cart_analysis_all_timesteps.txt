### Analysis:

1. **Obstacle 30182 (Stationary)**:
   - Position: (328.8969, 263.7877) at all timesteps.
   - Distance from Ego: ~26.5m at 0.9s (Ego at (306.1008, 267.1628)).
   - Relative velocity: Ego is moving away (Ego's velocity is positive in X-direction).
   - **Risk**: Negligible (5).

2. **Obstacle 30183 (Stationary after 0.3s)**:
   - Position: (319.1313, 260.164) after 0.3s.
   - Distance from Ego: ~13.0m at 0.9s.
   - Relative velocity: Ego is moving away (Ego's velocity is positive in X-direction).
   - **Risk**: Negligible (5).

3. **Obstacle 30186 (Moving)**:
   - Position: (332.7369, 274.1085) at 0.9s.
   - Distance from Ego: ~26.7m at 0.9s (Ego at (306.1008, 267.1628)).
   - Relative velocity: Obstacle is moving towards Ego (negative acceleration, but still moving away in X-direction).
   - **Risk**: Low (4).

### Summary:
- No obstacles pose an immediate or extreme risk to the Ego vehicle.
- All obstacles are either stationary or moving away from the Ego vehicle.
- The Ego vehicle is decelerating, further reducing any potential risk.
