At t=0.9s, the ego vehicle (ID 30185) is at (306.10, 267.16) with a velocity of 3.49 m/s and continues decelerating at -0.61 m/sÂ².  We analyze the risk posed by each obstacle:

* **Obstacle 30182:**  Stationary at (328.90, 263.79) in a different lanelet (864).  Poses no immediate risk due to the lateral separation and being in a different lane.  Risk: **Negligible (5)**.

* **Obstacle 30183:** Stationary at (319.13, 260.16) in the same lanelet (697) as the ego vehicle.  The ego vehicle is approaching this obstacle.  A rough estimate of longitudinal distance is around 13 meters.  Given the ego's speed and deceleration, a more precise TTC calculation is needed to determine the true level of risk, but it presents a potential risk. Risk: **Medium (3)**.

* **Obstacle 30186:** At (332.74, 274.11) in lanelet 864, moving with velocity 2.92 m/s and decelerating. The lateral separation and different lanelet suggest low risk, but we need to consider the future trajectory due to the ego vehicle's deceleration.  Risk: **Low (4)**.
