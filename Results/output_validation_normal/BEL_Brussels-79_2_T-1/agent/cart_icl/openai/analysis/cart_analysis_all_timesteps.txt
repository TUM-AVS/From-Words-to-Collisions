### Analysis

**At 0.9 seconds:**

- **Ego Vehicle**: 
  - Position: (306.1008, 267.1628)
  - Velocity: 3.4954 m/s
  - Located in lanelet 697.0

- **Obstacle 30182.0**: 
  - Position: (328.8969, 263.7877)
  - Velocity: 0.0 m/s
  - Located in lanelet 864.0
  - **Risk Assessment**: Since it is stationary and located in a different lanelet, there is no immediate risk of collision with the ego vehicle. **Negligible Risk (5)**

- **Obstacle 30183.0**: 
  - Position: (319.1313, 260.164)
  - Velocity: 0.0 m/s
  - Located in lanelet 697.0
  - **Distance to Ego**: Approximately 13.03 meters (calculated using Euclidean distance).
  - **TTC Calculation**: Not applicable due to it being stationary and far enough from the ego to pose no immediate threat. **Negligible Risk (5)**

- **Obstacle 30186.0**: 
  - Position: (332.7369, 274.1085)
  - Velocity: 2.9175 m/s
  - Located in lanelet 864.0
  - **Distance to Ego**: Approximately 27 meters (calculated using Euclidean distance).
  - **Risk Assessment**: It is moving in a different lanelet and is far from the ego vehicle. Therefore, there is no immediate collision risk. **Negligible Risk (5)**

### Conclusion

All obstacles in the provided scenario pose **no immediate risk** to the ego vehicle, maintaining a **negligible risk level** throughout the observed time frame. The distances and location differences between the ego vehicle and the obstacles, as well as stationary positions of obstacles, support the conclusion of negligible collision risk.
