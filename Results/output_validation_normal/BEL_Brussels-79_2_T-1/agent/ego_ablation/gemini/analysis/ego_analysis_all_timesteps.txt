At t=0.9s, Obstacle 30183 is directly in front of the ego vehicle and closing at -3.5 m/s with a longitudinal distance of 10.28 meters.  While decelerating slightly (0.54 m/sÂ²), the short distance and closing velocity represent a high risk. Obstacle 30182 is further away longitudinally (17.25m) and laterally offset (5.99m) posing less of an immediate risk despite the negative relative longitudinal velocity (-3.5 m/s). Obstacle 30186 is approaching from the front-left (15.86m longitudinal, 16.91m lateral) at a combined longitudinal and lateral speed that warrants monitoring, but it doesn't represent an immediate high risk.  Given the provided context, 30183 represents the only high risk obstacle.
