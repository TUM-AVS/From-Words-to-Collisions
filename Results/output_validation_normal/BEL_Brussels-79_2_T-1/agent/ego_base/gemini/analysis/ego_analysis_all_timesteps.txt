At t=0.9s, Obstacle 30183 is directly in front of the ego vehicle and closing at 3.5 m/s with a longitudinal distance of 10.28 meters. This represents a high risk as the time-to-collision (TTC) is approximately 2.9 seconds.

Obstacle 30182 is approaching the ego vehicle from the front-left at a slower closing velocity of 3.5 m/s. It is currently at a safer lateral distance of 5.99 m and longitudinal distance of 17.25 m. This presents a medium risk, manageable with proper reaction.

Obstacle 30186, also approaching from the front-left, has a larger lateral distance (16.91 m) and a greater longitudinal distance (15.86 m) than 30182. The closing velocity is slower as well, making this a medium risk at the present moment.
