### Safety analysis for timestep 0.9s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

**- Obstacle ID: 30182**
- Distance Risk reason:  Obstacle is at a safe longitudinal and lateral distance (17.25m in both directions) and located front-left relative to the ego vehicle.  
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason:  While the obstacle is approaching longitudinally (-3.50 m/s), the deceleration and current distance suggest ample time to react. Lateral movement is negligible.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

**- Obstacle ID: 30183**
- Distance Risk reason: Located in front of the ego vehicle at 10.28m longitudinal and lateral distance. This represents a closer proximity than Obstacle 30182.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason:  Approaching longitudinally at -3.50 m/s. The relatively small deceleration and closer proximity raise some concern.  Lateral movement is negligible.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3


**- Obstacle ID: 30186**
- Distance Risk reason:  Located front-left with 15.86m distance in both longitudinal and lateral directions. The distances alone suggest a moderate risk.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Moving towards the ego vehicle both longitudinally (-3.13 m/s) and laterally (-2.89 m/s). The combined motion represents the highest risk in this scenario.
- Time safety score: 2
- Overall Risk score: 3
