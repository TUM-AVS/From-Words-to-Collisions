At t=0.9s:

**Obstacle 30182:**

* **Trajectory:**  Consistently front-left of the ego vehicle, maintaining a lateral distance around 6m.  Longitudinal distance decreasing steadily, indicating approach. No lateral relative motion.
* **TTC (Longitudinal):** 17.25m / 3.50m/s ≈ 4.93s
* **MDC:**  Primarily lateral distance since the obstacle is approaching from a front-left direction. MDC ≈ 5.99m.
* **Risk:** Low (4), based on both TTC and MDC.

**Obstacle 30183:**

* **Trajectory:** Directly in front of the ego vehicle (0 lateral distance). Longitudinal distance decreasing steadily, indicating approach.
* **TTC (Longitudinal):** 10.28m / 3.50m/s ≈ 2.94s
* **MDC:** Since there is exact lateral alignment, MDC is evaluated based on the longitudinal distance, which is the only factor contributing to potential collision risk.  MDC = 10.28m.
* **Risk:** Medium (3), based on both TTC and MDC.

**Obstacle 30186:**

* **Trajectory:** Approaching from the front-left, with both longitudinal and lateral distances decreasing across timesteps.
* **TTC (Longitudinal):** 15.86m / 3.13m/s ≈ 5.07s
* **TTC (Lateral):** 16.91m / 2.89m/s ≈ 5.85s
* **MDC:** Given the diagonal approach, the smaller of the longitudinal and lateral distances is of primary concern although both are relatively large.
* **Risk:** Low (4), based on both TTC and MDC.
