To evaluate the scenario with obstacles 30182, 30183, and 30186:

### Obstacle 30182:  
- **Position:** Front-left  
- **Adjusted Distances:** Longitudinal 17.25 m, Lateral 5.99 m  
- **Relative Velocity:** Longitudinal -3.50 m/s, No lateral velocity  
- **Motion:** Approaching longitudinally, no lateral change  

**Trajectory Analysis:**  
- Observed a steady decrease in both longitudinal and lateral positions over time indicating a stable approach in the same trajectory without a change in lateral alignment.  
- Longitudinal distance decreased consistently between each timestep about 0.5 m with a consistent closing speed.

**Calculations:**  
- **TTC (Longitudinal):** \( \frac{17.25}{3.50} \approx 4.93 \) seconds  
- **MDC:** Due primarily to decreased longitudinal distance: 17.25 m (since lateral changes are negligible with no significant motion)

**Risk Assessment:**  
- **TTC (4.93 seconds) and MDC (17.25 meters)** suggest Low Risk.  
- **Risk Score:** 4 (Low Risk)

### Obstacle 30183:
- **Position:** Front  
- **Adjusted Distances:** Longitudinal 10.28 m, Lateral 0.00 m  
- **Relative Velocity:** Longitudinal -3.50 m/s, No lateral velocity  
- **Motion:** Approaching longitudinally in the same lane (exact lateral alignment)

**Trajectory Analysis:**  
- The obstacle shows a consistent reduction in longitudinal distance while maintaining lateral alignment in successive timesteps, showing progression within the same lane.

**Calculations:**  
- **TTC (Longitudinal):** \( \frac{10.28}{3.50} \approx 2.94 \) seconds  
- **MDC:** 10.28 m (as it travels directly in same lane towards ego)

**Risk Assessment:**  
- **TTC (2.94 seconds) and MDC (10.28 meters)** suggest Medium Risk.  
- **Risk Score:** 3 (Medium Risk)

### Obstacle 30186:
- **Position:** Front-left  
- **Adjusted Distances:** Longitudinal 15.86 m, Lateral 16.91 m  
- **Relative Velocity:** Longitudinal -3.13 m/s, Lateral -2.89 m/s  
- **Motion:** Approaching both longitudinally and laterally towards the ego car

**Trajectory Analysis:**  
- This obstacle demonstrates converging movements in both lateral and longitudinal directions, indicating a significant trajectory overlap risk over time.

**Calculations:**  
- **TTC (Longitudinal):** \( \frac{15.86}{3.13} \approx 5.06 \) seconds  
- **TTC (Lateral):** \( \frac{16.91}{2.89} \approx 5.85 \) seconds  
- **MDC:** Expected interaction point based on both paths indicates diagonal approach; given more significant overlap: approx 3.5 m

**Risk Assessment:**  
- Longitudinal TTC is slightly above 5 seconds, but the convergence and lateral interaction suggest Medium Risk due to combined trajectory.  
- **Risk Score:** 3 (Medium Risk)
