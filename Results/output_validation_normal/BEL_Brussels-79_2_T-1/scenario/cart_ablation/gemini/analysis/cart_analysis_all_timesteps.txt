At t=0.9s, Ego is in lanelet 697.0 at (306.1008, 267.1628) with a velocity of 3.4954 m/s.

Obstacle 30182.0 is stationary in lanelet 864.0 at (328.8969, 263.7877).  Given the different lanelets and the distance, this obstacle poses no immediate risk.

Obstacle 30183.0 is stationary in lanelet 697.0 at (319.1313, 260.164). While in the same lanelet, it is some distance away and stationary.  Its previous trajectory shows it coming to a stop. This doesn't represent an immediate collision risk.

Obstacle 30186.0 is in lanelet 864.0 at (332.7369, 274.1085) with a velocity of 2.9175 m/s.  Similar to obstacle 30182.0, the different lanelets suggest no immediate risk.

Therefore, no obstacles pose an immediate collision or extreme risk.
