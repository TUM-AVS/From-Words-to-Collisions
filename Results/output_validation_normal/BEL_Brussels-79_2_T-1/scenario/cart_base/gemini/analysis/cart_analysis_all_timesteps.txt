At t=0.9s, Ego is in lanelet 697.0 at (306.10, 267.16) with a velocity of 3.49 m/s.

Obstacle 30182.0 is stationary in lanelet 864.0 at (328.90, 263.79).  Given the different lanelets and the distance, this poses no immediate risk.

Obstacle 30183.0 is stationary in lanelet 697.0 at (319.13, 260.16). While in the same lanelet, it's stopped and a reasonable distance away, thus not an immediate risk.

Obstacle 30186.0 is in lanelet 864.0 at (332.74, 274.11) with a velocity of 2.92 m/s. Again, different lanelets suggest no immediate risk.

Based on the last provided timestep, no obstacle presents a collision or extreme risk.
