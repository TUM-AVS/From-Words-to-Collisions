### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 30182.0
- Distance Risk reason: This obstacle is in a different lanelet (864.0) than the ego vehicle (697.0).  Its position has remained constant throughout the scenario, and it poses no immediate threat. However, future movements of either vehicle could change this, so a moderate distance risk score is given.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: The obstacle is stationary, therefore posing no immediate time-related risk based on current movement.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 4

- Obstacle ID: 30183.0
- Distance Risk reason: This obstacle is in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle. Initially, there was a significant x-coordinate difference, but the obstacle's velocity decreased to zero over the timesteps. The distance remains substantial, but its presence in the same lane necessitates monitoring.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: The obstacle has come to a complete stop and has zero acceleration, effectively eliminating any immediate time-based collision risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 4

- Obstacle ID: 30186.0
- Distance Risk reason: This obstacle is in a different lanelet (864.0) than the ego vehicle (697.0) and its initial position is far from the ego vehicle.  Although the Y position is closer to the ego vehicle compared to obstacle 30182, the X positions and the different lanelets suggest a lower risk.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason:  The obstacle is moving with a decreasing velocity and negative acceleration. Its current trajectory doesn't indicate an immediate threat, but continued movement could pose a risk in the future.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4


### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. **Most critical obstacles:** Obstacle 30183.0 initially presented the most concern due to being in the same lanelet and having some velocity.  However, its rapid deceleration to a full stop mitigates this risk significantly within the provided timeframe.
2. **Trajectory Analysis (All 10 Timesteps):** Obstacle 30183.0 decelerated to a stop. Obstacle 30182.0 remained stationary. Obstacle 30186.0 appeared later in the scenario and its trajectory doesn't intersect with the ego vehicle's within the timeframe.
3. **Relative Positions, Velocities, Accelerations:**  The relative positions, coupled with the observed decelerations and stationary states, indicate no immediate collision.
4. **Collision Determination:** No collision has occurred, and none is imminent based on the 0.9-second data.
5. **Reasoning:** While initial observations might suggest a potential collision with obstacle 30183.0, its behavior over time (coming to a complete stop) removes the immediate danger.  The other obstacles are either stationary or in different lanelets and don't present an immediate collision risk within the given timeframe.
