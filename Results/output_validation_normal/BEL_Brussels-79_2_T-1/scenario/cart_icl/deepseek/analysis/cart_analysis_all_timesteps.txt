### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep:

### Obstacle Analysis:
#### Obstacle ID: 30182.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is stationary and far from the ego vehicle (~26.8m away). Over the timesteps, the ego vehicle is moving away from it.
- **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- **Time Risk reason**: The obstacle is stationary, and the ego vehicle is decelerating. No risk of collision.
- **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- **Overall Risk score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)

#### Obstacle ID: 30183.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is stationary (~15.8m ahead of the ego vehicle) and in the same lanelet. The ego vehicle is decelerating and will stop before reaching it.
- **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
- **Time Risk reason**: The ego vehicle is decelerating, and the obstacle is stationary. TTC is high as the ego vehicle will stop before reaching it.
- **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
- **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low Risk)

#### Obstacle ID: 30186.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is moving away from the ego vehicle (~26.6m away) in a different lanelet (864.0). No intersection with the ego's path.
- **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- **Time Risk reason**: The obstacle is moving away with decreasing velocity. No risk of collision.
- **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- **Overall Risk score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. **Obstacle 30182.0**: Stationary and far away. No collision risk.
2. **Obstacle 30183.0**: Stationary in the same lanelet but the ego is decelerating and will stop before reaching it. Low risk.
3. **Obstacle 30186.0**: Moving away in a different lanelet. No collision risk.
4. **Conclusion**: No collision or extreme risk obstacles. The scenario is safe.
