### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 30181.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is far from ego and moving away laterally.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Lateral velocity difference suggests no immediate risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 30182.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is laterally distant from ego.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Obstacle is stationary.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 30183.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is in the same lane and moderately close, but ego is decelerating.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: Both ego and obstacle are stationary or close to it.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- Obstacle ID: 30186.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is laterally distant from ego.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Lateral velocity difference suggests no immediate risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 30187.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is far from ego and moving away.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: No immediate time-related risk due to distance.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5


### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
No obstacles pose an immediate collision risk at the most recent timestep. The ego vehicle is decelerating, and the closest obstacle (30183.0) is also stationary or close to it in the same lane, but at a safe distance. No obstacles have trajectories that suggest a high probability of collision in the near future. Therefore, this is not a collision scenario.

### Summary in JSON Format:

{
  "CollisionObstacles": null,
  "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null,
  "ScenarioAnalysis": {
    "IsCollisionScenario": false,
    "Reasoning": "No obstacle is on a collision course with the ego vehicle.  The closest obstacle in the same lane is stationary and at a safe distance while the ego is decelerating."
