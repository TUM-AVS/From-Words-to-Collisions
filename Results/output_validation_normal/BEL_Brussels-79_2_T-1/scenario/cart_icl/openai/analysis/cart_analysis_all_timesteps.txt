### Obstacle Analysis:

**Obstacle ID: 30181**
- **Distance Risk Reason**: The obstacle is in a different lanelet (107) and moving farther away from the ego vehicle. The relative position transformation over time shows an increasing gap, indicating minimal interference risk.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 5
- **Time Risk Reason**: Consistent velocity with minor acceleration changes suggests stable movement away from the ego vehicle, mitigating collision risk.
- **Time Safety Score**: 5
- **Overall Risk Score**: 5

**Obstacle ID: 30182**
- **Distance Risk Reason**: Positioned in lanelet 864, stationary, and far from the ego vehicle's path.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 5
- **Time Risk Reason**: No velocity or acceleration over time indicates no immediate threat of collision.
- **Time Safety Score**: 5
- **Overall Risk Score**: 5

**Obstacle ID: 30183**
- **Distance Risk Reason**: Stationary in lanelet 697, but with no change in position since the first timestep. Remains distant from the ego vehicle path.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 5
- **Time Risk Reason**: No velocity and consistent position indicate static placement without impending collision course.
- **Time Safety Score**: 5
- **Overall Risk Score**: 5

**Obstacle ID: 30186**
- **Distance Risk Reason**: Lanelet 864, showing an outward trajectory from the ego vehicle's path, reducing potential collision due to increased lateral distance.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 4
- **Time Risk Reason**: Decline in velocity and slight negative acceleration indicate reducing longitudinal overlap risk with ego vehicle.
- **Time Safety Score**: 4
- **Overall Risk Score**: 4

**Obstacle ID: 30187**
- **Distance Risk Reason**: Located in lanelet 864 on a path leading away from the ego vehicle, with a consistent increase in clearance, especially on lateral margins.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 4
- **Time Risk Reason**: Decreasing velocity and negative acceleration suggest unlikely convergence towards the ego's path.
- **Time Safety Score**: 4
- **Overall Risk Score**: 4

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
- The ego vehicle remains primarily in lanelet 697, with obstacles in different lanelets or holding paths that do not intersect the ego's trajectory.
- No lateral or longitudinal trajectory suggests convergence or collision path.
- Consistent lateral and longitudinal separation across all timesteps helps determine overall negligible risk levels.
- Based on movement and distance, there's no evidence of an impending collision or extreme threat.

### Summary in JSON Format:

```json
{
    "CollisionObstacles": [],
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null,
    "ScenarioAnalysis": {
        "IsCollisionScenario": false,
        "Reasoning": "All obstacles either maintain stable positions or have trajectories leading away from the ego vehicle, with adequate separation maintained throughout."
    }
}
```

- Based on this analysis, there are no collision or extreme risk scenarios present with the current data. The ego vehicle and all obstacles maintain safe distances and trajectory divergence.
