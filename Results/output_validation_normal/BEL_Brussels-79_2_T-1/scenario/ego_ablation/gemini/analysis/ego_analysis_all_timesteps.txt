Obstacle 30183 is directly in front of the ego vehicle and closing at -3.50 m/s.  It is only 10.28 meters away longitudinally, representing a high risk. Although the lateral velocity is negligible, the longitudinal closing velocity combined with the short distance makes a collision likely if the ego vehicle does not brake or maneuver. Obstacle 30182 is further away longitudinally (17.25m) and also laterally offset (5.99m) posing less immediate risk than 30183 but should still be monitored. Obstacle 30186 is approaching diagonally from the front-left (15.86m longitudinal, 16.91m lateral) and also needs careful attention although not presenting as immediate a threat as 30183. The scenario needs urgent action to avoid a possible collision with 30183.
