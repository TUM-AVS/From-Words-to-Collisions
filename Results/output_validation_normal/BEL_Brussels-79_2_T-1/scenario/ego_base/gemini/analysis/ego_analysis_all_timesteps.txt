At t=0.9s, Obstacle 30183 is at a longitudinal distance of 10.28m and closing at -3.50 m/s.  While the relative lateral velocity is zero, the longitudinal distance suggests a high risk of collision if the ego vehicle does not brake or maneuver. Obstacle 30182 is further away longitudinally (17.25m) and poses less immediate risk, though it's still closing. Obstacle 30186 is both longitudinally (15.86m) and laterally (16.91m) closing in, posing a potential collision risk in the near future.  However, 30183 presents the most immediate risk due to its proximity and closing velocity.

        "Reasoning": "Obstacle 30183 poses an extreme risk due to its close longitudinal proximity (10.28m) and closing velocity (-3.50m/s), making a collision highly likely if immediate action isn't taken. While other obstacles are also closing, 30183 presents the most immediate threat."
