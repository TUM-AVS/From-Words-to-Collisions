### Safety analysis for timestep 0.9 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

It's important to note that the provided scenario information lacks ego vehicle dimensions and adjusted distances (adjusted_d_long and adjusted_d_lat).  Therefore, the analysis will be performed using the provided real distances (DTClong, DTClat), acknowledging that the results might not be entirely accurate without accounting for vehicle size.  Additionally, we lack information about the ego vehicle's motion and the absolute velocities of the obstacles. We can only infer relative motion.  This limits the precision of TTC calculations.

**Assumptions**:  Since adjusted distances are unavailable, I will assume a simplified vehicle size and subtract 2 meters from the longitudinal distances to roughly approximate a safety buffer. This is a crude approximation and should be replaced with proper adjusted distances in a real-world application. Also, a constant velocity model will be used to estimate TTC, given the lack of more precise motion information. This assumption is likely to underestimate TTC if the relative velocity is decreasing, as the provided acceleration values hint in some cases.

### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 30182**
- Distance Risk reason:  Obstacle is in the Front-left at 17.25m longitudinal and 17.25m lateral distance. Applying the 2m longitudinal safety buffer, we have 15.25m. This is a relatively safe distance at the moment.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason:  Longitudinal relative velocity is -3.50 m/s.  Assuming constant velocity, approximate TTClong is 15.25m / 3.50m/s ≈ 4.36s. This suggests a moderate risk as it could be quite close considering that we only estimated the safety buffer for the longitudinal distance. However, there is no lateral motion (Vrel_lat = 0), so lateral TTC (TTClat) is theoretically infinite. 
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3

- **Obstacle ID: 30183**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is directly in Front at 10.28m longitudinal and 10.28 lateral distance. Applying the 2m safety buffer gives 8.28m. This is a closer distance and poses a higher risk than Obstacle 30182.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: Longitudinal relative velocity is -3.50 m/s. Approximate TTClong is 8.28m / 3.50m/s ≈ 2.37s. No lateral motion (Vrel_lat = 0), so TTClat is theoretically infinite. The short TTClong increases the risk.
- Time safety score: 2
- Overall Risk score: 2

- **Obstacle ID: 30186**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is in the Front-left, at 15.86m longitudinal and 15.86m lateral distances.  Applying the 2m safety buffer, the longitudinal distance is 13.86m. It is relatively safe distance at the moment
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason:  Longitudinal relative velocity is -3.13 m/s and lateral is -2.89 m/s.  Approximate TTClong is 13.86m / 3.13m/s ≈ 4.43s, and TTClat is 15.86m/ 2.89 m/s ≈ 5.49s.  This represents a moderate time risk due to the converging motion in both directions.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3
