**Obstacle-by-Obstacle Analysis (Most Recent Timestep at 0.9 seconds)**

**Obstacle 30182:**
- **Position and Motion:** Front-left of ego vehicle. Adjusted longitudinal distance = 17.25 m, adjusted lateral distance = 5.99 m.
- **Relative Velocity:** Longitudinal = -3.50 m/s (approaching), Lateral = -0.00 m/s (no lateral movement).
- **Trajectory Analysis:** The obstacle exhibits minimal lateral movement and a consistent reduction in longitudinal distance over the past timesteps indicating a moderate approach towards the ego vehicle.
- **TTC Calculation:** 
  - TTC_longitudinal = 17.25 m / 3.50 m/s = 4.93 seconds.
  - Since there is no lateral closing velocity, TTC_lateral is not applicable.
- **MDC Calculation:** As lateral distance remains stable and is large (MDC = 5.99 m), risk derives from the longitudinal approach.
- **Risk Assessment:** Low Risk (4) as both TTC and MDC are > 5.0m and > 5.0s respectively.

**Obstacle 30183:**
- **Position and Motion:** Front of ego vehicle. Adjusted longitudinal distance = 10.28 m, adjusted lateral distance = 0.00 m.
- **Relative Velocity:** Longitudinal = -3.50 m/s (approaching), Lateral = -0.00 m/s (in an aligned path).
- **Trajectory Analysis:** The obstacle is on an exact alignment towards the ego vehicle. The longitudinal distance decreases consistently over time.
- **TTC Calculation:** 
  - TTC_longitudinal = 10.28 m / 3.50 m/s = 2.94 seconds.
  - TTC_lateral is not applicable due to zero lateral closing velocity.
- **MDC Calculation:** The MDC primarily relies on longitudinal distance, which is now at 10.28 m with continuous convergence.
- **Risk Assessment:** Medium Risk (3) as TTC falls between 1.0s and 3.0s with a continuously reducing longitudinal gap.

**Obstacle 30186:**
- **Position and Motion:** Front-left of ego vehicle. Adjusted longitudinal distance = 15.86 m, adjusted lateral distance = 16.91 m.
- **Relative Velocity:** Longitudinal = -3.13 m/s (approaching), Lateral = -2.89 m/s (approaching laterally).
- **Trajectory Analysis:** The obstacle is closing in both longitudinal and lateral directions, indicating a diagonal approach.
- **TTC Calculation:** 
  - TTC_longitudinal = 15.86 m / 3.13 m/s = 5.07 seconds.
  - TTC_lateral = 16.91 m / 2.89 m/s = 5.85 seconds.
  - The shorter TTC of about 5.07 seconds implies slight risk.
- **MDC Calculation:** As the obstacle is closing diagonally, MDC will depend on the intersection trajectory, which projects beyond 5.0m in both distances.
- **Risk Assessment:** No Risk (5), since both TTCs exceed 5.0s and MSD supports no immediate intersection within a dangerous proximity.

**Conclusion:**

- **Collision Scenario:** Analysis reveals no collision risk since none of the obstacles have a risk score of 0 (collision) or 1 (extreme risk).
- **Overall Condition:** Although Obstacle 30183 exhibits a medium risk due to the alignment and decreasing longitudinal gap, it does not justify the scenario as an immediate collision threat based on the criteria.
