The ego vehicle is decelerating significantly throughout the provided timeframe.  Both obstacles 30217 and 30218 are initially quite far from the ego vehicle, but their trajectories and the ego vehicle's deceleration warrant closer examination.

Obstacle 30217 is moving slightly closer to the ego vehicle's y-position over time, though still at a safe distance.  Its velocity fluctuates but generally remains higher than the ego vehicle's velocity after the first few timesteps.

Obstacle 30218 is further away in both x and y coordinates and also has a lower velocity than the ego vehicle throughout the timeframe.  While its y-position is getting closer to the ego vehicle, the distances and relative velocities suggest a low risk of collision.

Given the current data, no immediate collision is imminent. The ego vehicle's deceleration is a point of concern, but more future timesteps are needed to definitively assess the risk levels.  For now, both obstacles pose a low to negligible risk.
