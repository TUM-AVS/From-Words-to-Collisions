The ego vehicle is braking heavily, as evidenced by the negative acceleration values.  Let's analyze the obstacles:

* **Obstacle 30217.0:** This obstacle is moving at a relatively constant velocity and its x-position is getting closer to the ego vehicle's x-position over time. While the y-positions indicate some lateral separation, the closing rate in the x-direction suggests a potential risk if the ego vehicle continues to decelerate rapidly. This warrants closer monitoring and could escalate quickly. Initially, it appears to be a medium risk, but by 0.8 seconds, it becomes higher.

* **Obstacle 30218.0:** This obstacle appears to be moving slowly and not directly towards the ego vehicle. The y-position is significantly different from the ego vehicle. While in the same lanelet (471.0), it does not pose an immediate threat given the current trajectories.  This obstacle is low risk.

Considering the rapid deceleration of the ego vehicle and the closing x-position of Obstacle 30217.0, it's important to assess if the braking maneuver is intentional (e.g., stopping at a light) or indicative of an emergency. If emergency braking, the risk level of Obstacle 30217.0 increases substantially.  Over the time period, neither obstacle presents a collision or extreme risk situation, but 30217 is approaching a high-risk state.
