At t=0.9s, the ego vehicle is at (350.4052, -164.6683) with a velocity of 4.1148 and acceleration of -1.5286.  Let's analyze the two obstacles:

**Obstacle 30217.0:** Position (342.7432, -175.2872), velocity 6.1994, acceleration -2.1867.

* **Position Analysis:** The obstacle is behind the ego vehicle in the x-direction (342.7432 < 350.4052) but slightly offset laterally (-175.2872 vs -164.6683). The lateral difference is approximately 10.6. The longitudinal difference is approximately 7.7.

* **Velocity Analysis:** The obstacle's velocity (6.1994) is greater than the ego vehicle's (4.1148). This means the obstacle is closing the longitudinal gap, increasing risk.

* **Acceleration Analysis:** Both vehicles are decelerating, but the obstacle's deceleration is greater.  This *could* reduce the risk in the future, but it doesn't eliminate the immediate risk.

* **TTC and MDC Estimation (Approximate):**  With the obstacle moving faster and roughly same direction as ego vehicle, while decelerating faster, collision is unlikely. A simple distance check between ego and obstacle positions at current and next 0.1s interval assuming constant deceleration supports this.

**Obstacle 30218.0:** Position (335.6887, -186.204), velocity 5.8823, acceleration -1.9344.

* **Position Analysis:**  This obstacle is further behind the ego vehicle than Obstacle 30217.0 both longitudinally and laterally.

* **Velocity Analysis:** This obstacle's velocity (5.8823) is also higher than the ego vehicle's. However, being further away, the risk is lower than Obstacle 30217.0.

* **Acceleration Analysis:** Similar deceleration to Obstacle 30217.0.

* **TTC and MDC Estimation (Approximate):** Lower risk than 30217 due to larger initial separation. Collision unlikely.

**Overall Assessment:**

Based on the provided data and assuming relatively straight trajectories within the same lanelet, a collision is unlikely in the next few moments. The largest risk is from Obstacle 30217.0 due to its closer proximity and higher velocity, though still not high enough to label it Extreme risk. Hence, I've rated Obstacle 30217 as a Medium risk (3).  Obstacle 30218.0 poses a lower risk due to larger separation, also categorized as Medium (3).
