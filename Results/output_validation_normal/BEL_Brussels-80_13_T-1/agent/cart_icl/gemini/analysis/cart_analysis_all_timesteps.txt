At t=0.9s, the ego vehicle continues to decelerate significantly.  Let's analyze the risk posed by each obstacle:

**Obstacle 30217:** This obstacle is in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle and is moving slower.  The relative longitudinal velocity is approximately 2 m/s. While the distance between the vehicles is large, the closing rate is somewhat concerning.  However, there is still ample time and space for the ego vehicle to react. Risk level: Medium Risk.

**Obstacle 30218:** This obstacle is also in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle. The distance between the vehicles is greater than that of 30217, and the lateral separation is also more significant. The closing rate is relatively slow as well. Risk level: Low Risk.
