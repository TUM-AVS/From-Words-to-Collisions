Let's evaluate the scenario in chronological order, focusing on trends and the most recent timestamp, 0.9 seconds:

### Ego Vehicle:
- **Position**: (350.4052, -164.6683)
- **Orientation**: 0.9224643377077084
- **Velocity**: 4.1148 m/s (decreasing over time)
- **Acceleration**: -1.5286 m/s² (negative indicates deceleration)

### Obstacle 30217:
- **Position**: (342.7432, -175.2872)
- **Orientation**: 0.9696
- **Velocity**: 6.1994 m/s
- **Acceleration**: -2.1867 m/s² (negative indicates deceleration)

#### Analysis:
- **Longitudinal Relative Position**: Approximately -9.3612 meters (behind the ego vehicle).
- **Relative Longitudinal Velocity**: 2.0846 m/s (6.1994 - 4.1148). The obstacle is closing in on the ego.
- **TTC**: -9.3612 / 2.0846 ≈ -4.49 seconds (indicates overtaking from behind).
- **Lateral Distance**: Significant lateral separation suggesting overtaking or different lane usage.
- **Risk Assessment**: Given the overtaking nature and sufficient lateral distance, this is a **Medium Risk** scenario without immediate collision but requires monitoring.

### Obstacle 30218:
- **Position**: (335.6887, -186.204)
- **Orientation**: 1.0349
- **Velocity**: 5.8823 m/s
- **Acceleration**: -1.9344 m/s²

#### Analysis:
- **Longitudinal Relative Position**: Approximately -22.9165 meters (further behind the ego vehicle).
- **Relative Longitudinal Velocity**: 1.7675 m/s (5.8823 - 4.1148). This obstacle is closing in but at a lesser rate.
- **TTC**: -22.9165 / 1.7675 ≈ -12.97 seconds.
- **Lateral Distance**: Even larger separation suggesting no immediate lateral conflict.
- **Risk Assessment**: Given the significant distance, slower closing rate, and lateral distance, the risk is **Low Risk** and manageable.

### Summary and Risk Evaluation
Neither obstacle presents a severe risk currently, but they are closing in. Obstacle 30217 is closing at a higher rate and only presents a medium risk due to the lane separation and sufficient distance. Obstacle 30218, owing to its substantial following distance and slower closing rate, demonstrates a low risk.
