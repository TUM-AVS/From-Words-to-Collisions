At t=0.9s, Obstacle 30217 is behind the ego vehicle at a longitudinal distance of -8.58m, moving towards the ego vehicle with a longitudinal relative velocity of 2.08 m/s.  Laterally, the obstacle is aligned with the ego vehicle. Given the decreasing longitudinal distance and relatively high closing velocity, Obstacle 30217 represents a high risk.

Obstacle 30218, also behind the ego vehicle, is farther away at -21.54m, and approaching with a slower longitudinal relative velocity of 1.73 m/s.  Although it's moving closer, the distance and lower relative velocity make it less of an immediate concern compared to Obstacle 30217.
