### Safety analysis for timestep 0.9s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

**- Obstacle ID: 30217**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is behind the ego vehicle at -8.58m longitudinal and -8.58m lateral distance.  While it is approaching, it is still a safe distance at this timestep.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: The obstacle is closing the distance but the exact TTC is difficult to determine from the given data. However, based on the relative velocity and distance, there appears to be sufficient time to react.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4


**- Obstacle ID: 30218**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is behind the ego vehicle at -21.54m longitudinal and -21.54m lateral distance. This is a safe distance.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: The obstacle is closing the distance, but the relative velocity and distance suggest ample time to react.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5
