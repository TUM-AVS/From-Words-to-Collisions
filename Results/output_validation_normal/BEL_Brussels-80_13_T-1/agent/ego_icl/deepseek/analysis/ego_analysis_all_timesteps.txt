### Obstacle Analysis

#### Obstacle 30217
- **Position**: Behind ego car
- **Adjusted Distance**: Longitudinal -8.58 m, Lateral 0.00 m
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal 2.08 m/s (approaching), Lateral 0.29 m/s (minimal lateral movement)
- **Motion Description**: Obstacle is driving toward the ego car from behind. Exact lateral alignment.

**Trajectory Analysis**:
- Over the timesteps, the longitudinal distance decreases from -9.16 m to -8.58 m, indicating the obstacle is closing in on the ego vehicle.
- The lateral distance remains 0.00 m, indicating exact alignment in the same lane.
- The longitudinal relative velocity is consistently positive and increasing, suggesting the obstacle is accelerating toward the ego vehicle.

**Time-to-Collision (TTC)**:
- TTC = Distance / Relative Velocity = 8.58 m / 2.08 m/s ≈ 4.12 seconds
- This falls into the Low Risk category (3.0 < TTC ≤ 5.0 seconds).

**Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC)**:
- Since the obstacle is directly behind (lateral distance = 0.00 m), the MDC is the longitudinal distance: 8.58 m.
- This falls into the No Risk category (MDC > 5.0 meters).

**Overall Risk**:
- The higher risk assessment is Low Risk (4) based on TTC.

#### Obstacle 30218
- **Position**: Behind ego car
- **Adjusted Distance**: Longitudinal -21.54 m, Lateral 0.00 m
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal 1.73 m/s (approaching), Lateral 0.66 m/s (minimal lateral movement)
- **Motion Description**: Obstacle is driving toward the ego car from behind. Exact lateral alignment.

**Trajectory Analysis**:
- The longitudinal distance decreases from -21.50 m to -21.54 m, but the trend is not as consistent as Obstacle 30217.
- The lateral distance remains 0.00 m, indicating exact alignment in the same lane.
- The longitudinal relative velocity is positive but lower than Obstacle 30217.

**Time-to-Collision (TTC)**:
- TTC = Distance / Relative Velocity = 21.54 m / 1.73 m/s ≈ 12.45 seconds
- This falls into the No Risk category (TTC > 5.0 seconds).

**Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC)**:
- MDC is the longitudinal distance: 21.54 m.
- This falls into the No Risk category (MDC > 5.0 meters).

**Overall Risk**:
- The higher risk assessment is No Risk (5) based on both TTC and MDC.

### Final Notes:
- Neither obstacle poses an immediate collision or extreme risk. Obstacle 30217 has a Low Risk due to its closing speed, but the distance is still significant. Obstacle 30218 is even further away and poses No Risk.
- The ego vehicle should monitor Obstacle 30217 for any acceleration or sudden changes in trajectory, but no immediate action is required.
