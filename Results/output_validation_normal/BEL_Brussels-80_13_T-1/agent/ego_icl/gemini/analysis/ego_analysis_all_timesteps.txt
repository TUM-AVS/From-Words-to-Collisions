At t=0.9s:

Obstacle 30217:

- Located behind the ego vehicle.
- Longitudinal distance: -8.58m (negative indicates behind)
- Lateral distance: 0.00m (indicates perfect lateral alignment, but not necessarily a collision)
- Longitudinal relative velocity: 2.08 m/s (positive, closing rapidly)
- Lateral relative velocity: 0.29 m/s 
- Motion: Approaching from behind.

Analysis:
- MDC is primarily based on longitudinal distance due to rear location. MDC ≈ 8.58m. This alone suggests a low risk.
- However, the high closing longitudinal velocity is concerning.
- TTC = distance / relative_velocity = 8.58m / 2.08 m/s ≈ 4.12s. This corresponds to a Low Risk (4).

Obstacle 30218:

- Located behind the ego vehicle.
- Longitudinal distance: -21.54m
- Lateral distance: 0.00m
- Longitudinal relative velocity: 1.73 m/s (positive, closing)
- Lateral relative velocity: 0.66 m/s
- Motion: Approaching from behind.

Analysis:
- MDC ≈ 21.54m. This suggests no risk.
- TTC = 21.54m / 1.73 m/s ≈ 12.45s. This also suggests no risk.


Overall Assessment:

While both obstacles are approaching from behind and perfectly laterally aligned, the MDC and TTC values indicate no immediate collision risk.  Obstacle 30217 presents a low risk due to its closer proximity and higher closing velocity.  Obstacle 30218 poses negligible risk.
