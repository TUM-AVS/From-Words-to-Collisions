### Obstacle-by-Obstacle Analysis

#### Obstacle 30217:
- **Trajectory Analysis:**
  - At 0.0 seconds, the obstacle was moving away from the ego vehicle.
  - By 0.2 seconds, it began moving towards the ego vehicle.
  - By 0.9 seconds, it has consistently moved closer.
  - Longitudinal distance decreased from -9.16m to -8.58m indicating the obstacle is closing in on the ego vehicle.
  - Relative velocity in the longitudinal direction increased to 2.08 m/s, meaning it is approaching the ego vehicle faster.

- **TTC Calculation:**
  - **TTC Longitudinal**: 
    \[
    \text{TTC}_\text{long} = \frac{8.58}{2.08} = \text{approximately } 4.12 \text{ seconds}
    \]
  - **TTC Lateral** is not significant here due to `0.00m` lateral position and small lateral velocity.

- **MDC Calculation:**
  - Assuming a steady increase in approach speed, the shortest distance might occur sooner. Ergo, the MDC longitudinal is monitored.
  - There is no close lateral distance to worry about due to the alignment.

- **Risk Assessment:**
  - TTC longitudinal is greater than 3 seconds but less than 5 seconds, indicating a **Low Risk**.
  - The MDC and the decreasing trajectory need consideration, but there isn't an immediate risk.

#### Obstacle 30218:
- **Trajectory Analysis:**
  - The obstacle began behind and continued to drive towards the ego vehicle, though at a slower rate.
  - Longitudinal distance changed from -21.50m to -21.54m without significant impact.
  - The relative velocity in the longitudinal direction fluctuated and settled at 1.73 m/s toward the ego vehicle.

- **TTC Calculation:**
  - **TTC Longitudinal**: 
    \[
    \text{TTC}_\text{long} = \frac{21.54}{1.73} = \text{approximately } 12.45 \text{ seconds}
    \]
  - Lateral velocity and distance are not significant contributors to close collision risk due to full alignment.

- **MDC Calculation:**
  - Due to small changes in distance and velocity, the trajectory does not suggest a riskier configuration.

- **Risk Assessment:**
  - TTC significantly above 5 seconds in longitudinal indicates **Negligible Risk**.
  - Despite the movement toward the ego vehicle and a slightly decreasing trajectory, no indication of convergence within a critical window.

### Explanation:
1. **Obstacle 30217** poses a low-level risk. Its trajectory is closing with moderate pace; however, TTC places it in a low-risk zone, warranting vigilance without immediate action.
2. **Obstacle 30218** maintains a safe buffer with a negligible risk due to extended TTC and no accelerating convergence, precluding critical action.
