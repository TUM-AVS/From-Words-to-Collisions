At t=0.9s, Ego (350.4052, -164.6683) is in the same lane (471) as obstacles 30217 (342.7432, -175.2872) and 30218 (335.6887, -186.204).

Obstacle 30217:  While the y-coordinates suggest some lateral separation, the x-coordinates show 30217 is closing in on Ego rapidly. Given the current velocities and accelerations, a collision or near miss in the next few timesteps is highly likely.  This obstacle presents an Extreme Risk.

Obstacle 30218: Although in the same lane, obstacle 30218's x-position is significantly behind Ego and its trajectory doesn't suggest an imminent collision. Therefore, it poses a lower risk than 30217.
