At t=0.9s, Ego (30215.0) is at (350.4052, -164.6683) and decelerating.

Obstacle 30217.0 is at (342.7432, -175.2872) also decelerating.  The y-coordinates suggest they are in different lanes, reducing immediate risk. The x-coordinates show a closing distance, but the deceleration trends lessen immediate collision risk. This obstacle does not pose an extreme risk (1) or collision (0).

Obstacle 30218.0 is at (335.6887, -186.204) and decelerating.  Again, the y-coordinates suggest different lanes.  This obstacle is further away in the x-direction than 30217.0 and poses even less risk.

Based on the 0.9s data and trajectory trends, no obstacle poses an extreme or collision risk.
