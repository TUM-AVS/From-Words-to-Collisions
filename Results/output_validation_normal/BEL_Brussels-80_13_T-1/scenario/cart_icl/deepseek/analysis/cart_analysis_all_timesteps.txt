### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep:

### Obstacle Analysis:
#### Obstacle ID: 30217
- **Distance Risk reason**: Over the past 9 timesteps, the obstacle has been moving towards the ego vehicle but remains at a significant distance (~7.5m longitudinal, ~10.5m lateral). The lateral distance is increasing slightly over time.
- **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
- **Time Risk reason**: Relative velocity is decreasing (ego is decelerating faster than the obstacle). TTC is increasing due to divergent trajectories.
- **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
- **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low Risk)

#### Obstacle ID: 30218
- **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is further away (~15m longitudinal, ~21m lateral) and moving away from the ego vehicle's path. Lateral distance is increasing over time.
- **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- **Time Risk reason**: The obstacle is decelerating while moving away from the ego's path. Relative velocity indicates no convergence.
- **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- **Overall Risk score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. All obstacles are in the same lanelet but moving away from the ego vehicle's trajectory
2. Both obstacles show increasing lateral separation over time
3. Ego vehicle's deceleration is reducing closure rates
4. No convergence of trajectories observed in any dimension
5. All risk scores are â‰¥4 indicating safe operation
