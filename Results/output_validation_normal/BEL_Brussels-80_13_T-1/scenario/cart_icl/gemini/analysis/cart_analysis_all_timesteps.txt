### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 30216.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is far from ego and in a different lanelet. No risk observed in the provided trajectory history.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason:  Relative velocities and accelerations do not indicate a collision course based on provided data.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 30217.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is in the same lanelet as Ego but positioned behind. Though the distance is decreasing, it doesn't pose an immediate threat within the observed timeframe.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Ego is decelerating faster than Obstacle 30217.0, indicating a potential risk if this trend continues. Requires monitoring.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3

- Obstacle ID: 30218.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is behind ego, and although in the same lanelet, the separation is significant considering the current and historical trajectory. 
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Ego's deceleration is higher than the obstacle's, but the current separation and velocity difference don't indicate an immediate collision risk.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4


### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. At the last timestep (0.9s), no obstacle is at the same position as the Ego vehicle.
2. Analyzing the trajectories, Obstacle 30216.0 is in a different lanelet and poses no collision risk.
3. Obstacles 30217.0 and 30218.0 are behind the Ego vehicle in the same lanelet.
4. While Ego is decelerating faster than both, the current distance and velocity differences suggest no immediate collision.
5. Therefore, this is not a collision scenario within the predicted timeframe.

### Summary in JSON Format:
