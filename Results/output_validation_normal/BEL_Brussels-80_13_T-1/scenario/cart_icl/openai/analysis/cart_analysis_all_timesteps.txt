### Obstacle Analysis:

#### Obstacle 30216
- **Distance Risk Reason**: This obstacle is consistently located in a separate lanelet from the ego vehicle throughout all time steps. The significant distance and lack of intersection of trajectories imply no immediate collision risk.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 5
- **Time Risk Reason**: The obstacle's velocity and acceleration indicate steady movement away from the ego vehicle, maintaining a safe trajectory.
- **Time Safety Score**: 5
- **Overall Risk Score**: 5

#### Obstacle 30217
- **Distance Risk Reason**: This obstacle is in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle. However, its path remains largely stable with a consistent distance that does not sufficiently close the gap for a collision.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 4
- **Time Risk Reason**: The relative velocities and accelerations show a pattern of stable parallel movement, with no evident trend leading to an imminent collision.
- **Time Safety Score**: 4
- **Overall Risk Score**: 4

#### Obstacle 30218
- **Distance Risk Reason**: Obstacle remains in the same lanelet as the ego and has shown a trend of moving closer over previous time steps, albeit not alarming enough for immediate collision but requires monitoring.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 3
- **Time Risk Reason**: Consistently decreasing velocity and slight positional convergence may suggest a potential risk if trends persist, but not immediate.
- **Time Safety Score**: 3
- **Overall Risk Score**: 3

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
- No immediate collision risk is presented as none of the obstacles encroach the space significantly nor exhibit dangerous convergence patterns.
- Several factors like separate lanelet positioning (for Obstacle 30216) and stable, non-converging trajectories (for Obstacle 30217 and Obstacle 30218) support this assessment.
- The scenario remains manageable without significant risk if current trends continue.
