Obstacle 30217 is approaching the ego vehicle from behind, closing the distance rapidly.  At the last timestep, it's only 8.58 meters behind and its relative longitudinal velocity indicates it's getting closer at an increasing rate. Although the lateral distance is currently zero, the small lateral velocity suggests a low lateral risk. However, the decreasing longitudinal distance poses a significant and increasing rear-end collision risk.

Obstacle 30218 is also approaching from behind but is much farther away at 21.54 meters. Its relative longitudinal velocity is positive, indicating it is also getting closer. While not an immediate threat, its continued approach warrants monitoring.
