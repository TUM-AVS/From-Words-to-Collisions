At t=0.9s, Obstacle 30217 is behind the ego vehicle at -8.58m longitudinal and 0.0m lateral distance. It is approaching the ego vehicle with a longitudinal relative velocity of 2.08 m/s. Although the relative longitudinal acceleration is negative (-0.31 m/s²), the obstacle's high closing velocity and proximity pose a high risk.

Obstacle 30218 is also behind the ego vehicle at -21.54m longitudinal and 0.0m lateral distance.  It is approaching with a longitudinal relative velocity of 1.73 m/s. The relative longitudinal acceleration is slightly negative (-0.06 m/s²). While this obstacle is further away than 30217, its closing velocity warrants attention and indicates a medium risk.

Neither obstacle poses an immediate collision risk within the next timestep, but 30217 requires close monitoring due to its proximity and closing velocity.

**Risk Levels and Definitions:**
<Collision (Score: 0)>: Actual collision has occurred or is unavoidable within the next timestep.
<Extreme Risk (Score: 1)>: Immediate collision or very high likelihood of impact. Urgent action is required.
<High Risk (Score: 2)>: Close to collision or highly probable collision path. Needs prompt attention and quick manoeuvring.
<Medium Risk (Score: 3)>: Moderate collision risk but manageable with timely reactions and proper strategies.
<Low Risk (Score: 4)>: Minimal collision risk. The situation is controllable with sufficient time to react.
<Negligible Risk (Score: 5)>: No significant collision risk. Obstacles are either moving away or far enough not to interfere.
