### Safety analysis for timestep 0.9 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

There are no adjusted distances provided, so raw distances will be used with a strong cautionary note that the analysis may not be fully accurate.  It's crucial to incorporate vehicle dimensions for a realistic assessment.  Also, lateral "Exact lateral alignment or unknown case" information is insufficient for accurate lateral TTC/MDC calculation. We will assume no lateral movement for simplicity, but in a real-world scenario, this ambiguity is problematic.

**Obstacle Analysis:**

- **Obstacle ID: 30217**
- **Distance Risk reason:** Obstacle is behind the ego vehicle at -8.58m longitudinal and -8.58m lateral distance.  While behind, the small magnitude of longitudinal distance suggests proximity and potential risk if the ego vehicle were to reverse or brake sharply.
- **Distance safety score:** 3 (Medium Risk)
- **Time Risk reason:**  The obstacle is closing longitudinally with a positive relative velocity (2.08 m/s).  Although decelerating slightly longitudinally (-0.31 m/s²), the current rate of closure presents a medium-term risk.  Lateral movement cannot be accurately assessed due to ambiguous lateral information.
- **Time safety score:** 3 (Medium Risk)
- **Overall Risk score:** 3 (Medium Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 30218**
- **Distance Risk reason:** Obstacle is behind the ego vehicle at -21.54m longitudinal and -21.54m lateral distance. This distance represents a lower risk than obstacle 30217.
- **Distance safety score:** 4 (Low Risk)
- **Time Risk reason:**  The obstacle is closing longitudinally with a positive relative velocity (1.73 m/s) and is decelerating slightly longitudinally (-0.06 m/s²).  The larger longitudinal distance makes the risk lower than 30217. The lateral movement cannot be accurately assessed.
- **Time safety score:** 4 (Low Risk)
- **Overall Risk score:** 4 (Low Risk)


### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
  "CollisionObstacle": null,
  "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null,
  "IsCollisionScenario": false,
  "Justification": "No obstacle presents an immediate collision risk within the predicted timeframe, but Obstacle 30217 requires monitoring due to its proximity and closing velocity.  The lack of precise lateral movement data for both obstacles introduces uncertainty into the analysis. Using raw distances instead of adjusted distances further reduces the accuracy of the assessment."
