### Obstacle-by-Obstacle Analysis

#### Obstacle 30217 (Most Recent Timestep: 0.9s)
- **Position**: Behind ego car
- **Adjusted Distance**: Longitudinal -8.58 m, Lateral 0.00 m
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal 2.08 m/s (approaching), Lateral 0.29 m/s (small lateral drift)
- **Motion Description**: Obstacle is driving toward the ego car from behind with exact lateral alignment.
- **Trajectory Analysis**:
  - Longitudinal distance is decreasing (from -9.16m at 0.1s to -8.58m at 0.9s).
  - Lateral distance remains 0.00m (exact alignment).
  - Relative velocity is positive longitudinally (closing gap) and small laterally (minimal drift).
- **TTC Calculation**:
  - Longitudinal TTC = 8.58 / 2.08 ≈ 4.13 seconds (Low Risk, TTC > 3.0s).
  - Lateral TTC: Not applicable (lateral velocity is very small and not converging).
- **MDC Calculation**:
  - Since obstacle is directly behind (lateral = 0.00m), MDC is effectively the longitudinal distance (8.58m).
  - MDC > 5.0m (No Risk).
- **Overall Risk**: 
  - Longitudinal: Low Risk (TTC = 4.13s, MDC = 8.58m).
  - Lateral: No Risk (no convergence).
  - **Final Risk Score**: 4 (Low Risk).

#### Obstacle 30218 (Most Recent Timestep: 0.9s)
- **Position**: Behind ego car
- **Adjusted Distance**: Longitudinal -21.54 m, Lateral 0.00 m
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal 1.73 m/s (approaching), Lateral 0.66 m/s (small lateral drift)
- **Motion Description**: Obstacle is driving toward the ego car from behind with exact lateral alignment.
- **Trajectory Analysis**:
  - Longitudinal distance is decreasing (from -21.50m at 0.1s to -21.54m at 0.9s, but note fluctuations due to acceleration).
  - Lateral distance remains 0.00m (exact alignment).
  - Relative velocity is positive longitudinally (closing gap) and small laterally (minimal drift).
- **TTC Calculation**:
  - Longitudinal TTC = 21.54 / 1.73 ≈ 12.45 seconds (No Risk, TTC > 5.0s).
  - Lateral TTC: Not applicable (lateral velocity is very small and not converging).
- **MDC Calculation**:
  - Since obstacle is directly behind (lateral = 0.00m), MDC is effectively the longitudinal distance (21.54m).
  - MDC > 5.0m (No Risk).
- **Overall Risk**: 
  - Longitudinal: No Risk (TTC = 12.45s, MDC = 21.54m).
  - Lateral: No Risk (no convergence).
  - **Final Risk Score**: 5 (No Risk).

### Collision Scenario Determination
- Neither obstacle has a risk score of 0 (Collision) or 1 (Extreme Risk).
- Both obstacles are at a safe distance with no imminent collision risk.
- The closest obstacle (30217) is 8.58m behind with a TTC of 4.13s, which is Low Risk.
