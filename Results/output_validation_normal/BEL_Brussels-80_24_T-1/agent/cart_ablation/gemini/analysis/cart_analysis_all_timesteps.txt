Here's the analysis and the JSON output:

**Analysis:**

The ego vehicle (30220) is consistently in lanelet 15 and decelerating. We need to assess the risk posed by other vehicles.

* **Obstacle 30221:** This obstacle is in the adjacent lanelet (14) and initially moving faster than the ego vehicle.  Although initially moving faster, it appears to also be decelerating in more recent timesteps. This, along with their positions, warrants attention for potential lane changes or other maneuvers that might lead to a high risk situation.

* **Obstacle 30223:** This obstacle is in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle (15) and initially quite far behind.  Its speed fluctuates slightly but overall, there doesn't seem to be an immediate collision risk. However, given the ego vehicle's deceleration, this obstacle's relative speed might increase, making its risk potentially higher than negligible in the near future.


* **Obstacle 30224:** This obstacle is also in the adjacent lanelet (14), somewhat behind the ego vehicle. It's moving faster than the ego vehicle. This obstacle appears to be less of a concern than 30221 due to its distance, but still worth monitoring for any sudden maneuvers.

* **Obstacles 30215, 30217, 30218:** These obstacles are in different lanelets (471 and 473) and are essentially stationary or moving very slowly. They don't present any immediate risk.

* **Obstacle 30216:** This obstacle is in a different lanelet and is moving away from the ego vehicle.  It poses no risk.


Based on the provided data, no obstacle presents an immediate collision risk (risk score 0 or 1). Obstacle 30221 is considered a High Risk (score 2) due to its proximity and initially higher velocity than Ego even though it's in a neighboring lane. While it seems to be decelerating, the overall situation requires closer monitoring. Obstacle 30223 and 30224 are also watched carefully.
