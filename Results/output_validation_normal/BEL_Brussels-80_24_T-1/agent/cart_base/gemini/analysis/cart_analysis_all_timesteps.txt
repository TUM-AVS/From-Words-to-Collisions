Here's the analysis and the JSON output:

**Analysis:**

* **Ego and Obstacle 30221:** Obstacle 30221 starts in a neighboring lane (lanelet 14) and is initially traveling faster than Ego. Although the lateral distance is significant, 30221's initial acceleration is positive while Ego's is negative. However, in subsequent timesteps, 30221's acceleration becomes negative and its velocity decreases. The lateral distance and the diverging trajectories suggest a decreasing risk over time, putting it in the medium to low-risk category.

* **Ego and Obstacle 30223:** This obstacle is behind Ego in the same lane (lanelet 15). It moves slower than Ego and the distance between them increases over the given timeframe. This represents a low to negligible risk.

* **Ego and Obstacle 30224:** This obstacle is behind Ego in the adjacent lane (lanelet 14). The combination of lateral separation and similar velocities suggests a low to negligible risk.

* **Ego and Obstacles 30215, 30217, 30218:**  These obstacles are significantly far from Ego and in different lanelets. They pose a negligible risk throughout the observed period.

* **Ego and Obstacle 30216:** This obstacle is far from Ego and in a different lanelet.  It does not pose any immediate risk.
