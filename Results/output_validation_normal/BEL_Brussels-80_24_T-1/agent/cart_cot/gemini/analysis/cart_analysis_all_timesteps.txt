At t=0.9s, the ego vehicle (ID 30220) is at (346.3603, -147.4065) with a velocity of 4.4647 and decelerating at -1.6812. Let's analyze the risk posed by each obstacle at this timestep:

* **Obstacle 30215:** Position (348.8419, -166.7312), velocity 0.005, acceleration -0.0053.  This obstacle is far from the ego vehicle laterally and poses negligible risk.  Score: 5

* **Obstacle 30216:** Position (367.5907, -159.899), velocity 7.7691, acceleration -0.2242. This obstacle is relatively far and its lateral position is also separated from the ego vehicle. Score: 5.

* **Obstacle 30217:** Position (353.3933, -160.7708), velocity 0.0, acceleration 0.0.  Stationary and far from the ego vehicle. Score: 5

* **Obstacle 30218:** Position (344.4277, -172.834), velocity 0.035, acceleration -0.0447. Far laterally, minimal longitudinal risk. Score: 5

* **Obstacle 30221:** Position (349.4, -145.1702), velocity 6.0329, acceleration -4.6477. This obstacle is the closest one to the ego vehicle and is slightly ahead. Both are decelerating. The lateral distance is small, and needs to be monitored closely. Although a collision is not imminent in the next few timesteps, the rapid deceleration of both vehicles and the small lateral separation raise some concern.  Score: 3

* **Obstacle 30223:** Position (326.4173, -134.6581), velocity 7.6349, acceleration 0.3846. This obstacle is behind the ego vehicle and further to the left. No immediate risk. Score: 5

* **Obstacle 30224:** Position (329.5619, -132.5336), velocity 9.4987, acceleration 0.3751.  This obstacle is also behind the ego vehicle and to the left, showing no immediate risk but needs to be monitored due to its higher speed than ego vehicle and closing velocity. Score: 4
