At t=0.9s, the ego vehicle (ID 30220) is at (346.3603, -147.4065) with a velocity of 4.46 m/s and decelerating at -1.68 m/s².  Let's analyze the risk posed by each obstacle:

* **Obstacle 30215:** Stationary, far laterally and longitudinally. Negligible risk.
* **Obstacle 30216:**  Moving in a different lanelet, far away. Negligible risk.
* **Obstacle 30217:** Stationary and far away. Negligible risk.
* **Obstacle 30218:** Stationary and far away. Negligible risk.
* **Obstacle 30221:** In adjacent lanelet, moving at 6.03 m/s.  The lateral distance is significant and appears safe at this timestep, however we should monitor. Medium Risk
* **Obstacle 30223:**  In the same lanelet and ahead of the ego vehicle, traveling slower.  We need to calculate TTC.  Approximate relative velocity is 4.46 - 7.63 = -3.17 m/s (ego is catching up).  Approximate longitudinal distance is 326.4173 - 346.3603 = -19.943m (obstacle is ahead). TTC = -19.943 / -3.17 ≈ 6.29s.  While there's ample time, we should continue monitoring since the ego vehicle is decelerating more aggressively. Low Risk.
* **Obstacle 30224:** In adjacent lane, slightly ahead and moving faster. Minimal lateral distance needs further monitoring. Medium Risk.
