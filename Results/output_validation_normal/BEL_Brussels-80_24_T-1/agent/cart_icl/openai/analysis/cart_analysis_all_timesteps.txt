### Brief Analysis
To perform the collision risk assessment, let's analyze the current situation at 0.9 seconds:

- **Ego Vehicle (30220.0):**
  - Position: (346.3603, -147.4065)
  - Velocity: 4.4647 m/s
  - Acceleration: -1.6812 m/sÂ²

1. **Obstacle 30215.0:**
   - Position: (348.8419, -166.7312)
   - Velocity: 0.005 m/s
   - Lanelet: 471.0 (different from Ego's lanelet)
   - Relative position: Quite far behind and to the side with near-zero velocity
   - **Negligible Risk (5):** Significant lateral distance and slow movement

2. **Obstacle 30216.0:**
   - Position: (367.5907, -159.899)
   - Velocity: 7.7691 m/s
   - Lanelet: 690.0 (different from Ego's lanelet)
   - Relative position: Ahead and to the side, moving away
   - **Negligible Risk (5):** Sufficient lateral distance, no threat

3. **Obstacle 30217.0:**
   - Stationary and different lanelet from Ego vehicle
   - **Negligible Risk (5):** Not in Ego's lane

4. **Obstacle 30218.0:**
   - Position: (344.4277, -172.834)
   - Velocity: 0.035 m/s
   - Lanelet: 471.0 (different from Ego's lanelet)
   - Relative position: Far behind Ego with minimal velocity
   - **Negligible Risk (5):** High lateral distance, no immediate threat

5. **Obstacle 30221.0:**
   - Position: (349.4, -145.1702)
   - Velocity: 6.0329 m/s
   - Lanelet: 14.0 (different from Ego's lanelet)
   - Relative position: Ahead and slightly to the side
   - **Low Risk (4):** Not in immediate path but requires attention if lane change occurs

6. **Obstacle 30223.0:**
   - Position: (326.4173, -134.6581)
   - Velocity: 7.6349 m/s
   - Lanelet: 15.0 (same as Ego's lanelet)
   - Relative longitudinal position: Approaching fast from behind
   - TTC Calculation: Distance approximated based on position (assuming linear path considering orientation):
     - Approximate distance: ~23.4 m (using Pythagorean theorem)
     - Relative velocity: ~3.17 m/s (as Ego's velocity is lower)
     - TTC: ~7.38 seconds (safe, requires attention but sufficient time to react)
   - **Medium Risk (3):** Manageable with awareness of rear approach

7. **Obstacle 30224.0:**
   - Same position trend as Obstacle 30223, moving in a different lanelet
   - **Negligible Risk (5):** Ahead but in a different lanelet

### Summary
Based on analysis, the collision risk evaluation identifies no immediate threats:
