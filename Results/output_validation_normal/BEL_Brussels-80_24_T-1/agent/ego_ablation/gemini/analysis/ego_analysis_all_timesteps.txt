At t=0.9s, obstacle 30218 is the closest to the ego vehicle with a longitudinal distance of 7.23m and a lateral distance of -21.03m. It is approaching the ego vehicle with a longitudinal relative velocity of -4.46 m/s and a small lateral relative velocity of 0.03 m/s. Given its proximity and speed, it poses the greatest risk.  While other obstacles are moving closer, their distances and relative velocities suggest more reaction time available. Obstacle 30217 is also quite close longitudinally (8.5m) but further laterally, and 30215 is approaching similarly to 30218 but is slightly further away at 7.77m. The remaining obstacles are significantly further from the ego vehicle. Although 30218's lateral distance is significant (-21.03 m denotes it's quite far to the right), the combined longitudinal approach and speed makes it the most significant risk. There is no collision.
