At t=0.9s, Obstacle 30218 is the closest obstacle, at 7.23m longitudinally and -21.03m laterally (front-right).  It is approaching at -4.46 m/s longitudinally and 0.03 m/s laterally. While the lateral movement is minimal, the longitudinal approach is significant. Given the short distance and approach speed, this obstacle poses a high risk. Other front-right obstacles (30215, 30217) are further away and pose medium risk. Obstacle 30224 (rear-left) is approaching quickly, but its greater distance makes it a medium risk. The remaining obstacles pose low or negligible risks due to their distance, relative velocity, and direction of travel.
