### Safety analysis for timestep 0.9s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

**Assumptions and Clarifications:**

* Since adjusted distances (adjusted_d_long, adjusted_d_lat) are not provided in the scenario context, the provided real distances (DTClong, DTClat) will be used for the analysis.  This isn't ideal, as vehicle size isn't accounted for, but it's necessary given the available data.
* TTC calculations will be simplified due to the lack of constant velocity/acceleration information.  A more robust TTC calculation would normally involve integrating the relative motion equations over time, but we'll use a simpler approximation:  `TTC = Distance / Relative Velocity`.  This approximation assumes constant velocity over the short term. If relative velocity is close to zero, we will assume TTC = infinity (no collision risk based on current velocity) and consider acceleration.
* A negative TTC value indicates that the vehicles are moving away from each other or were already overlapping at the start.
* We consider an obstacle a possible collision if it is driving toward the ego car.

**General Notes:** Multiple obstacles are in close proximity to the ego vehicle, particularly in the front-right region.  Obstacles 30215, 30217, and 30218 are all converging on the ego vehicle from this direction and require careful monitoring. Obstacle 30218 poses the highest risk as the latest distance is smallest within 0.9s.
