* **Obstacle 30215:** This obstacle is approaching from the front-right.  Over the past 0.9 seconds, it has moved closer in both longitudinal and lateral dimensions. At the last timestep, the longitudinal distance is 7.77m and the lateral distance is -13.52m, and closing. The relative longitudinal velocity is -4.46 m/s.  The TTC longitudinally is 7.77/4.46 = 1.74 seconds. The lateral velocity is minimal, so lateral TTC isn't a significant concern. MDC is approximately 7.77m. The obstacle's continuous approach and calculated TTC put this obstacle at a **Medium Risk (3)**.

* **Obstacle 30216:** This obstacle is in front of the ego vehicle and has been moving away longitudinally across all timesteps. At 0.9 seconds, the longitudinal distance is 20.12 m. The longitudinal relative velocity is positive (3.29 m/s), confirming that it's moving away.  TTC calculation is not applicable here due to diverging trajectories. MDC is 20.12 m. This is a **Negligible Risk (5)**.

* **Obstacle 30217:** Similar to Obstacle 30215, this obstacle approaches from the front-right but poses a higher risk due to a smaller longitudinal distance (8.50m) at the last timestep. The longitudinal relative velocity is -4.46 m/s, resulting in a TTC of 8.50/4.46 = 1.90 seconds. Lateral movement is negligible. MDC is approximately 8.50m.  This obstacle is a **Medium Risk (3)**.

* **Obstacle 30218:**  Approaching from the front-right, this obstacle is the closest of the front obstacles at 7.23m longitudinally at the final timestep. The relative longitudinal velocity is -4.46 m/s, resulting in a TTC of 7.23/4.46 = 1.62 seconds. The lateral distance remains large, so lateral risk is minimal. MDC is approximately 7.23m. This is a **Medium Risk (3)**.

* **Obstacle 30221:** This obstacle is to the left of the ego vehicle, maintaining a consistent lateral distance of around 1.89m. The longitudinal distance is 0.00 m, meaning it travels along the same longitudinal line. But the obstacle move away from the ego car laterally. TTC and MDC is not applicable due to there are some data missing. However, given the lateral distance and slight lateral movement, it represents a **Medium Risk (3)**. 

* **Obstacle 30223:**  This obstacle is behind the ego vehicle and approaching. It was initially moving away but began approaching longitudinally from 0.3 seconds. At 0.9 seconds, the longitudinal distance is -19.16m and the relative longitudinal velocity is 3.17 m/s. The TTC is 19.16 / 3.17 = 6.05 seconds.  MDC is approximately 19.16m. Given the aligned trajectory but safe distance and TTC, this obstacle represents a **Low Risk (4)**.

* **Obstacle 30224:** This obstacle is approaching from the rear-left and is the closest of the rear obstacles.  At 0.9 seconds, it's at -17.60m longitudinally with a closing velocity of 5.03 m/s. The TTC is 17.60 / 5.03 = 3.50 seconds. The lateral distance remains relatively stable, so the primary concern is longitudinal. MDC is approximately 17.60m. This represents a **Low Risk (4)**.
