### Analysis:

#### Obstacle 30215 (Front-right):
- **Trajectory and Motion:** The obstacle has been consistently moving toward the ego vehicle both longitudinally and laterally. Relative longitudinal velocity has decreased significantly, indicating deceleration.
- **Adjusted Distances:** Longitudinal: 8.29m, Lateral: -13.51m.
- **TTC Calculation:**
  - Longitudinal: \( TTC = \frac{8.29m}{4.77 m/s} \approx 1.74 \) seconds
  - Lateral movement is minimal, suggesting primary concern is longitudinal.
- **MDC Calculation:** Primarily longitudinal, stable, increasing due to de-acceleration, so not immediately critical in collision trajectory.
- **Risk Assessment:** Medium risk due to rapid closing but not imminent; longitudinal TTC comfortable. Risk primarily mitigated by deceleration trend. 
- **Overall Risk Score:** 3 (Medium Risk)

#### Obstacle 30216 (Front):
- **Trajectory and Motion:** Directly in the front with longitudinal distance steadily increasing, no notable threat.
- **Adjusted Distances:** Longitudinal: 20.12m, Lateral: 0.00m.
- **TTC Calculation:** Longitudinal: Not applicable as vehicle is moving apart (positive relative velocity).
- **MDC Calculation:** Longitudinal channel clear, ample distance.
- **Risk Assessment:** No risk with increasing separation distance.
- **Overall Risk Score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)

#### Obstacle 30217 (Front-right):
- **Trajectory and Motion:** Has been progressively closing in with mainly longitudinal concern.
- **Adjusted Distances:** Longitudinal: 8.50m, Lateral: -6.05m.
- **TTC Calculation:**
  - Longitudinal: \( TTC = \frac{8.50m}{4.46 m/s} \approx 1.91 \) seconds
- **MDC Calculation:** Mainly longitudinal, stable, slightly decreasing through progression. No immediate cross-paths.
- **Risk Assessment:** Medium risk given timing to converge paths within close proximity.
- **Overall Risk Score:** 3 (Medium Risk)

#### Obstacle 30218 (Front-right):
- **Trajectory and Motion:** Strongly converging from considerable distance with longitudinal priority.
- **Adjusted Distances:** Longitudinal: 7.23m, Lateral: -21.03m.
- **TTC Calculation:**
  - Longitudinal: \( TTC = \frac{7.23m}{4.46 m/s} \approx 1.62 \) seconds
- **MDC Calculation:** Linear convergence from front. Marginal lateral, mostly longitudinal.
- **Risk Assessment:** Medium risk considering converging trajectory, substantial path overlap with limited time to diverge.
- **Overall Risk Score:** 3 (Medium Risk)

#### Obstacle 30221 (Left):
- **Trajectory and Motion:** Consistent lateral velocity with minor longitudinal influence, moving marginally closer from the side.
- **Adjusted Distances:** Longitudinal: 0.00m, Lateral: 1.89m.
- **TTC Calculation:** Not applicable longitudinally, minimal lateral concerns.
- **MDC Calculation:** Sufficient lateral allowance for comfort.
- **Risk Assessment:** Low risk as posed mainly on lateral trajectory.
- **Overall Risk Score:** 4 (Low Risk)

#### Obstacle 30223 (Behind):
- **Trajectory and Motion:** Moving toward car but far behind.
- **Adjusted Distances:** Longitudinal: -19.16m, Lateral: 0.00m.
- **TTC Calculation:** Longitudinal - Maneuver distance is significant.
- **MDC Calculation:** Behind and moving away, no cross-path collision risk.
- **Risk Assessment:** Low risk, distance growing.
- **Overall Risk Score:** 4 (Low Risk)

#### Obstacle 30224 (Rear-left):
- **Trajectory and Motion:** Closing from rear at relatively higher speed.
- **Adjusted Distances:** Longitudinal: -17.60m, Lateral: 2.20m.
- **TTC Calculation:**
  - Longitudinal: Not immediate due to significant initial distance.
- **MDC Calculation:** Lowest paths cross longitudinally given, speed, allowing ample collision avoidance time.
- **Risk Assessment:** Low risk due to significant forward clearance.
- **Overall Risk Score:** 4 (Low Risk)
