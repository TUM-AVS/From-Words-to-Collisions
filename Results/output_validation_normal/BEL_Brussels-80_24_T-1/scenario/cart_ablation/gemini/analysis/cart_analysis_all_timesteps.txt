At t=0.9s, Ego (30220.0) is in lanelet 15.0 at (346.3603, -147.4065).  Let's analyze the closest obstacles:

* **Obstacle 30221.0:** Located in lanelet 14.0 at (349.4, -145.1702). While the y-coordinate suggests a different lane, the x-coordinate indicates a rapidly decreasing longitudinal distance. Given the velocity trends, a collision is likely imminent if both Ego and Obstacle 30221.0 maintain their current trajectories. This is classified as Extreme Risk.

* **Obstacle 30223.0:** In the same lanelet (15.0) as Ego at (326.4173, -134.6581). This obstacle is significantly behind Ego and poses no immediate threat.

* **Obstacle 30224.0:** Located in lanelet 14.0 at (329.5619, -132.5336). Similar to Obstacle 30223.0, this obstacle is also behind Ego and poses no immediate threat.

Other obstacles are in different lanelets and significantly further away, posing no immediate risk.
