At t=0.9s, Ego (30220.0) is in lanelet 15.0 at (346.3603, -147.4065) with velocity 4.46.  Let's analyze the closest obstacles:

* **Obstacle 30221.0:** Located in lanelet 14.0 at (349.4, -145.1702) with velocity 6.03.  This obstacle is relatively close to the ego vehicle and in an adjacent lanelet, but the trajectories suggest they are diverging slightly. While this merits attention, it doesn't appear to be an immediate collision risk.

* **Obstacle 30223.0:** Located in the same lanelet 15.0 at (326.4173, -134.6581) with velocity 7.63. This obstacle is significantly behind the ego vehicle and moving slower.  There is no immediate collision risk.

* **Obstacle 30224.0:**  Located in lanelet 14.0 at (329.5619, -132.5336) with velocity 9.49. Similar to 30223, this obstacle is further behind and in an adjacent lane, presenting no immediate risk.

Other obstacles are in different lanelets and significantly further away, posing no immediate threat.
