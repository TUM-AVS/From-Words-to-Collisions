### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:

- Obstacle ID: 30215.0
- Distance Risk reason: This obstacle is located in a different lanelet (471.0) than the ego vehicle (15.0) and poses no immediate threat based on its current position.  Its historical trajectory also shows minimal movement.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason:  The obstacle's velocity is near zero and has remained so throughout the observed timeframe. There is no indication of any impending movement towards the ego vehicle's path.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 30216.0
- Distance Risk reason: This obstacle is located in a different lanelet (690.0)  than the ego vehicle (15.0).  Its trajectory shows it moving away from the ego vehicle.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Although the obstacle has a substantial velocity, it's moving away from the ego vehicle and its lane.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 30217.0
- Distance Risk reason: Located in a different lanelet (473.0), this obstacle is stationary and poses no immediate risk. Its history confirms its static nature.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: The obstacle's velocity is zero and has remained constant.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 30218.0
- Distance Risk reason: This obstacle, although in a different lanelet (471.0), is relatively close to the ego vehicle. However, its historical trajectory suggests it's moving slowly and not directly towards the ego vehicle's path.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: The obstacle's velocity is low and decreasing. It doesn't pose an immediate time-related risk.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- Obstacle ID: 30221.0
- Distance Risk reason: This obstacle is in a different lanelet (lanelet 14.0) but close to the ego vehicle (15.0). It requires careful monitoring due to the proximity.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: The obstacle is moving with a relatively high velocity, but its acceleration is consistently negative, indicating it's slowing down, lessening the time-related risk.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3

- Obstacle ID: 30223.0
- Distance Risk reason: This obstacle is located in the same lanelet (15.0) as the ego vehicle, but significantly behind it, posing no immediate spatial risk.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason:  The obstacle's velocity is lower than the ego vehicle's, and its acceleration is fluctuating but generally not accelerating aggressively.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- Obstacle ID: 30224.0
- Distance Risk reason:  This obstacle is in a neighboring lanelet (14.0) and further behind than obstacle 30223.0. The lateral and longitudinal distance minimizes spatial risk.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: This obstacle's velocity is higher than that of the ego vehicle, although both vehicles are braking which makes the time risk moderate
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 4


### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. **Most critical obstacles:** Obstacle 30221.0 is the most critical due to proximity to the ego vehicle and relatively high velocity, even though it is in the adjacent lane. Obstacles 30223.0 and 30224.0 also require attention as they share the same or adjacent lane, albeit further behind.

2. **Trajectory analysis:** Over the observed timesteps, obstacle 30221.0 shows a trend of decelerating, while the ego vehicle is also decelerating more rapidly. The trajectories of 30223.0 and 30224.0 do not indicate an immediate collision course, although they need monitoring. Other obstacles are either stationary or moving away, presenting no immediate concern.

3. **Relative position, velocity, and acceleration:** The relative positions and velocities, combined with deceleration trends, suggest a decreasing collision risk for all obstacles.

4. **Collision determination:** Based on the available data, no collision has occurred or appears imminent within the next second.

5. **Reasoning:** Although obstacle 30221.0 is relatively close and initially moving at a higher speed, both its and the ego vehicle's deceleration trends suggest they are unlikely to collide. The remaining obstacles are either stationary, in different lanes, or far enough behind to pose a low risk.

### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
  "CollisionObstacles": null,
  "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null,
  "ScenarioAnalysis": {
    "IsCollisionScenario": false,
    "Reasoning": "No collisions are detected or predicted. Obstacle 30221 posed the highest initial risk due to proximity and speed, but its deceleration, along with the ego vehicle's deceleration, indicates a decreasing collision risk. All other obstacles maintain safe distances, are in different lanes, or exhibit safe movement patterns."
