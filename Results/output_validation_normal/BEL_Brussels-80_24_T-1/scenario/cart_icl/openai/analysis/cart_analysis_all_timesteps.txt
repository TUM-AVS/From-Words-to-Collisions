### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 30215.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason:** The obstacle is stationary with minimal movement and distant from the ego vehicle, evidenced by its position stability over time.
  - **Distance safety score:** 5
  - **Time Risk reason:** With velocities almost negligible, the potential time to any collision is almost infinite, implying negligible risk.
  - **Time safety score:** 5
  - **Overall Risk score:** 5

- **Obstacle ID: 30216.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason:** This obstacle is on a crossing trajectory; however, it's far from the ego vehicle's path and consistently maintaining its path with little risk.
  - **Distance safety score:** 4
  - **Time Risk reason:** The obstacle's velocity and distance indicate it is unlikely to pose a threat within a short timeframe.
  - **Time safety score:** 4
  - **Overall Risk score:** 4

- **Obstacle ID: 30217.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason:** Currently stationary and positioned on a different trajectory from the ego vehicle. 
  - **Distance safety score:** 5
  - **Time Risk reason:** No velocity or acceleration, indicating no imminent threat.
  - **Time safety score:** 5
  - **Overall Risk score:** 5

- **Obstacle ID: 30218.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason:** Positioned further away from the ego's trajectory and showing minimal movement over time.
  - **Distance safety score:** 4
  - **Time Risk reason:** Minimal velocity and acceleration diminish any collision risk within relevant driving timeframes.
  - **Time safety score:** 4
  - **Overall Risk score:** 4

- **Obstacle ID: 30219.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason:** Located in a distant lanelet, moving slowly and away, reducing proximity risk.
  - **Distance safety score:** 5
  - **Time Risk reason:** Low, retreating speeds and decreasing acceleration result in highly manageable collision timing.
  - **Time safety score:** 5
  - **Overall Risk score:** 5

- **Obstacle ID: 30221.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason:** Primarily parallel to the ego's path but situated in a different lanelet; not converging with the ego vehicle.
  - **Distance safety score:** 4
  - **Time Risk reason:** Relatively high speed but with separation over past steps, limiting collision potential imminently.
  - **Time safety score:** 4
  - **Overall Risk score:** 4

- **Obstacle ID: 30222.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason:** Far behind the ego vehicle and following a parallel route without apparent convergence.
  - **Distance safety score:** 5
  - **Time Risk reason:** Low velocity with deceleration, reducing the chance of reaching critical proximity in time.
  - **Time safety score:** 5
  - **Overall Risk score:** 5

- **Obstacle ID: 30223.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason:** Following in the same lanelet but not closing the gap quickly, maintaining a safe distance.
  - **Distance safety score:** 3
  - **Time Risk reason:** Matching the ego's lane with moderate velocity but not accelerating towards a collision.
  - **Time safety score:** 3
  - **Overall Risk score:** 3

- **Obstacle ID: 30224.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason:** On an adjacent path and not approaching the ego's trajectory.
  - **Distance safety score:** 4
  - **Time Risk reason:** While fast, consistently moves in another lanelet's vector, reducing intersection chance.
  - **Time safety score:** 4
  - **Overall Risk score:** 4

- **Obstacle ID: 30225.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason:** Distance maintained well from the ego's position in every observed frame, indicating safety.
  - **Distance safety score:** 5
  - **Time Risk reason:** Its velocity doesn't suggest its imminent arrival at the ego's area of influence.
  - **Time safety score:** 5
  - **Overall Risk score:** 5

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
After reviewing obstacle positions and ego trajectory, there is no evidence of potential collision or extreme risk events given that all obstacles are either non-converging or too far to intercept the ego's path within the projection window analyzed.
