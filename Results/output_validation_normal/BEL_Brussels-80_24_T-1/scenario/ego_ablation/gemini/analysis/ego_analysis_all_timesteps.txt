Obstacle 30218 is located at 7.23m in front and 21.03 to the right of the ego vehicle. It has a longitudinal velocity of -4.46 m/s, meaning it is approaching the ego vehicle. While it is moving slightly to the right at 0.03m/s, the lateral distance is significant. The risk of collision depends on the ego vehicle's future trajectory and potential maneuvers of both vehicles. Given the decreasing longitudinal distance, there's potential for a collision in the near future.

Obstacle 30217 is at 8.5m ahead and 6.05m to the right of the ego, approaching longitudinally at -4.46m/s with no lateral movement. There's a moderate risk if the ego continues on its current path.

Obstacle 30215 is at 7.77m ahead and 13.52m to the right, moving towards the ego at -4.46m/s longitudinally and slightly towards the right laterally (0.0m/s).  This presents a moderate collision risk, though less than 30217 due to the greater lateral distance.
