At t=0.9s, Obstacle 30218 is the closest obstacle, at 7.23m longitudinally and -21.03m laterally (front-right). It's approaching the ego vehicle at -4.46 m/s longitudinally and 0.03 m/s laterally.  While this is a close proximity, it doesn't represent an immediate collision given the lateral distance and relatively low longitudinal closing speed. No obstacle shows an immediate risk of collision in this timestep.
