### Safety analysis for timestep 0.9 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

It's crucial to note that the provided scenario description lacks adjusted distances (adjusted_d_long and adjusted_d_lat).  As instructed, these adjusted values are essential for accurate risk assessment.  Therefore, the analysis below is based on *relative* risk using the available real distances (longitudinal and lateral), relative velocities, and relative accelerations, but the absence of adjusted distances introduces significant uncertainty.  The scores should be treated as preliminary and refined once adjusted distance data is available.  I'll explicitly call out the impact of missing adjusted distances in each obstacle's evaluation.

A general observation is that lateral movement information, while provided, is less critical in this scenario as most of the immediate risks stem from longitudinal movement, particularly for obstacles approaching the ego vehicle from the front and rear.

**### Obstacle Analysis:**

- **Obstacle ID: 30215**
- Distance Risk reason:  At 7.77m longitudinally and laterally in the front-right, this obstacle is relatively close. Without adjusted distances, the precise risk is hard to determine. The lateral velocity suggests minimal lateral movement relative to the ego vehicle.
- Distance safety score: 3 (Medium Risk)
- Time Risk reason: The negative longitudinal velocity indicates the obstacle is moving towards the ego vehicle.  The magnitude of the velocity (-4.46 m/s) suggests a moderately short TTC.  Precise TTC calculation is impossible without knowing the ego vehicle's speed and the adjusted distances.
- Time safety score: 2 (High Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 2 (High Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 30216**
- Distance Risk reason: Located 20.12m longitudinally and laterally in front, this obstacle presents the lowest risk among those listed. 
- Distance safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
- Time Risk reason: The positive longitudinal velocity (3.29 m/s) indicates the obstacle is moving away from the ego vehicle longitudinally.
- Time safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 4 (Low Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 30217**
- Distance Risk reason: Similar to 30215, this obstacle at 8.5m longitudinally and laterally front-right poses a significant risk, exacerbated by its motion directly towards the ego vehicle. Lack of adjusted distances hinders accurate risk assessment.
- Distance safety score: 3 (Medium Risk)
- Time Risk reason: The negative velocity (-4.46 m/s) suggests a short TTC, but exact calculation requires more information.
- Time safety score: 2 (High Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 2 (High Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 30218**
- Distance Risk reason: The closest obstacle at 7.23m longitudinally and laterally front-right, combined with its motion towards the ego vehicle, makes this the highest risk obstacle based on available data.  Missing adjusted distances are crucial here to confirm this.
- Distance safety score: 2 (High Risk)
- Time Risk reason:  Similar to 30215 and 30217, the negative longitudinal velocity indicates approach and potential for a very short TTC.
- Time safety score: 1 (Extreme Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 1 (Extreme Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 30221**
- Distance Risk reason:  This obstacle's longitudinal and lateral distances of 0m are alarming. However, the context suggests a likely misinterpretation or edge case of "Left" positioning.  It's possible this obstacle is alongside the ego vehicle.  Adjusted distances are essential to clarify this.
- Distance safety score:  3 (Medium Risk - due to ambiguity) 
- Time Risk reason: The positive longitudinal velocity suggests this obstacle isn't a collision threat from a longitudinal perspective. The small negative lateral velocity combined with negative relative lateral acceleration indicates that the car may come closer to the ego vehicle. However, without further context, it's unclear.
- Time safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 3 (Medium Risk)


- **Obstacle ID: 30223**
- Distance Risk reason:  At nearly 20m behind, this obstacle isn't an immediate threat based on distance.
- Distance safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
- Time Risk reason:  However, the positive longitudinal velocity towards the ego car (3.17 m/s) raises concern. This obstacle is closing the distance quickly.
- Time safety score: 3 (Medium Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 3 (Medium Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 30224**
- Distance Risk reason: Similar to 30223, the distance behind (17.6m) is relatively safe.
- Distance safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
- Time Risk reason:  The positive velocity towards the ego vehicle (5.03 m/s) indicates a rapid approach from behind.
- Time safety score: 2 (High Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 3 (Medium Risk)
