Obstacle-by-Obstacle Analysis at t=0.9s:

* **Obstacle 30215:** Front-right, 7.77m longitudinal, -13.52m lateral.  The obstacle is approaching longitudinally (-4.46 m/s) and slightly laterally (0.00 m/s).

    * Longitudinal TTC = 7.77m / 4.46m/s = 1.74s (Medium Risk)
    * Lateral TTC: Not applicable due to near-zero lateral velocity.
    * MDC:  Using the smallest distance, 7.77m (Low Risk).

    * Overall Risk: Medium (3) - based on longitudinal TTC.

* **Obstacle 30216:** Front, 20.12m longitudinal, 0.00m lateral. Moving away longitudinally (3.29 m/s).

    * Longitudinal TTC: Not applicable - moving away.
    * Lateral TTC: Not applicable due to zero lateral distance and relatively stable lateral motion, despite a small positive lateral velocity. 
    * MDC: 20.12m (No Risk)

    * Overall Risk: No Risk (5)

* **Obstacle 30217:** Front-right, 8.50m longitudinal, -6.05m lateral. Approaching longitudinally (-4.46 m/s).

    * Longitudinal TTC = 8.50m / 4.46m/s = 1.90s (Medium Risk)
    * Lateral TTC: Not applicable due to zero lateral velocity.
    * MDC: 6.05m (No Risk).

    * Overall Risk: Medium (3)

* **Obstacle 30218:** Front-right, 7.23m longitudinal, -21.03m lateral. Approaching longitudinally (-4.46 m/s) and slightly laterally (0.03 m/s).

    * Longitudinal TTC = 7.23m / 4.46m/s = 1.62s (Medium Risk)
    * Lateral TTC: Extremely large due to slow lateral velocity, not a concern.
    * MDC: 7.23m (Low Risk)

    * Overall Risk: Medium (3) - based on longitudinal TTC.

* **Obstacle 30221:** Left, 0.00m longitudinal, 1.89m lateral. Slightly moving away laterally (-0.02m/s) but longitudinally moving away from the ego vehicle (1.57m/s).

    * Longitudinal TTC: Not applicable - Moving apart longitudinally.
    * Lateral TTC:  Not applicable, due to lateral distance remaining relatively stable.
    * MDC: 1.89 m (Medium Risk).

    * Overall Risk: Medium (3) - based on lateral MDC.

* **Obstacle 30223:** Behind, -19.16m longitudinal, 0.00m lateral. Approaching longitudinally (3.17 m/s). The lateral distance is zero, indicating perfect alignment, but the motion description and trajectory indicate a stable state in the lateral direction.

    * Longitudinal TTC = 19.16m / 3.17m/s = 6.05s (No Risk)
    * Lateral TTC: Not applicable - lateral distance is 0m, but motion indicates stability in that dimension.
    * MDC: 19.16m (No Risk)

    * Overall Risk: No Risk (5)

* **Obstacle 30224:** Rear-left, -17.60m longitudinal, 2.20m lateral.  Approaching longitudinally (5.03 m/s) and driving toward ego laterally from the left (-0.25m/s).

    * Longitudinal TTC = 17.60m / 5.03m/s = 3.50s (Low Risk)
    * Lateral TTC: Due to stable lateral movement, lateral TTC is very high, not a concern.
    * MDC: 2.20m (Medium Risk).

    * Overall Risk: Medium (3).


Collision Scenario Determination:

No obstacle has a risk score of 0 (collision) or 1 (extreme risk).  Therefore, this is NOT a collision scenario.
