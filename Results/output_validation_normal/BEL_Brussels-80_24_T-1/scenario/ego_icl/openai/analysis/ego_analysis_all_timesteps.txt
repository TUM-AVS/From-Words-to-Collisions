Let's analyze each obstacle in the most recent timestep (0.9 seconds) and establish the trajectory, calculating the Time-to-Collision (TTC), Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC), and assessing the risk.

### Obstacle-by-Obstacle Analysis:

#### Obstacle 30215:
- **Position**: Front-right
- **Adjusted Longitudinal Distance**: 7.77 m
- **Adjusted Lateral Distance**: -13.52 m
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal -4.46 m/s, Lateral 0.00 m/s
- **Motion Description**: Driving toward ego car longitudinally and laterally from the right.

**Trajectory Analysis**:
- Longitudinal distance is decreasing, indicating the obstacle is approaching.
- No lateral movement relative to the ego car, sustaining a lateral displacement of -13.52 m.

**Risk Calculations**:
- **TTC (Longitudinal)**: 7.77 m / 4.46 m/s = 1.74 seconds
  - Risk: Medium Risk (3) as TTC is between 1.0 and 3.0 seconds.
- **MDC (Longitudinal)**: 7.77 m
  - Risk: MDC > 5.0 meters, No Risk (5) in terms of distance.

**Overall Risk**: Medium Risk (3). Since there are no critical risk trends emerging from either component, it reflects the lowest combined risk score.

#### Obstacle 30216:
- **Position**: Front
- **Adjusted Longitudinal Distance**: 20.12 m
- **Adjusted Lateral Distance**: 0.00 m
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal 3.29 m/s, Lateral 0.43 m/s
- **Motion Description**: Moving away longitudinally. Exact lateral alignment.

**Trajectory Analysis**:
- Moving away longitudinally, increasing longitudinal distance from ego vehicle.
- Lateral misalignment or exact alignment, indicating no lateral convergence.

**Risk Calculations**:
- **TTC (Longitudinal)**: Not applicable since moving away.
- **MDC**: Not applicable as no converging trajectories; distance is increasing.

**Overall Risk**: No Risk (5), as the obstacle is moving further away.

#### Obstacle 30217:
- **Position**: Front-right
- **Adjusted Longitudinal Distance**: 8.50 m
- **Adjusted Lateral Distance**: -6.05 m
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal -4.46 m/s
- **Motion Description**: Driving toward longitudinally.

**Trajectory Analysis**:
- Both longitudinal and lateral distances are stable, indicating a continued approach primarily longitudinally.

**Risk Calculations**:
- **TTC (Longitudinal)**: 8.50 m / 4.46 m/s = 1.91 seconds
  - Risk: Medium Risk (3) due to TTC between 1.0 and 3.0 seconds.
- **MDC (Longitudinal)**: 8.50 m
  - Risk: MDC > 5.0 meters, No Risk (5).

**Overall Risk**: Medium Risk (3), since no immediate collision.

#### Obstacle 30218:
- **Position**: Front-right
- **Adjusted Longitudinal Distance**: 7.23 m
- **Adjusted Lateral Distance**: -21.03 m
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal -4.46 m/s, Lateral 0.03 m/s
- **Motion Description**: Driving toward longitudinally and laterally.

**Trajectory Analysis**:
- Maintaining a stable approach in both dimensions.

**Risk Calculations**:
- **TTC (Longitudinal)**: 7.23 m / 4.46 m/s = 1.62 seconds
  - Risk: Medium Risk (3) for longitudinal component.
- **MDC (Longitudinal)**: 7.23 m on a stable path, but decreasing.
  - Risk: MDC > 5.0 meters, No Risk (5).

**Overall Risk**: Medium Risk (3), considering the approach stability.

#### Obstacle 30221:
- **Position**: Left
- **Adjusted Longitudinal Distance**: 0.00 m
- **Adjusted Lateral Distance**: 1.89 m
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal 1.57 m/s, Lateral -0.02 m/s
- **Motion Description**: Exact longitudinal alignment, driving laterally from the left.

**Trajectory Analysis**:
- Moving laterally away, stable in its course without longitudinal convergence.

**Risk Calculations**:
- **MDC (Lateral)**: 1.89 meters, stable or increasing.
  - Risk: Medium Risk (3) for lateral components.

**Overall Risk**: Medium Risk (3), primarily considering lateral drift away.

#### Obstacle 30223:
- **Position**: Behind
- **Adjusted Longitudinal Distance**: -19.16 m
- **Adjusted Lateral Distance**: 0.00 m
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal 3.17 m/s
- **Motion Description**: Driving toward from behind, exact lateral alignment.

**Trajectory Analysis**:
- Approaching from behind but with increasing distance due to initial large gap.

**Risk Calculations**:
- **TTC**: Not directly applicable due to static initial negative spacing.

**Overall Risk**: No Risk (5), as the approach does not lead to convergence.

#### Obstacle 30224:
- **Position**: Rear-left
- **Adjusted Longitudinal Distance**: -17.60 m
- **Adjusted Lateral Distance**: 2.20 m
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal 5.03 m/s, Lateral -0.25 m/s
- **Motion Description**: Driving toward from behind and laterally left.

**Trajectory Analysis**:
- Consistent increase in relative approach speed, but lateral positioning promises safety through extended longitudinal distance.

**Risk Calculations**:
- **TTC**: Not applicable due to initial increasing gap from behind.

**Overall Risk**: Low Risk (4), potential for lateral adjustment within safe distance.
    

### Conclusion:
All obstacles are within manageable distances and timelines for sake of medium risk or lower. None present imminent risk of collision.
