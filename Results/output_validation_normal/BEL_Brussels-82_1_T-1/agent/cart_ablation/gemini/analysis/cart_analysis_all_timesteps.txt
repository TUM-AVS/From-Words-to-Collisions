Obstacle 30235 is in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle and initially closer than obstacle 30237. While 30235's acceleration fluctuates, its position consistently gets closer to the ego vehicle.  Between 0.4 and 0.5 seconds, its acceleration jumps significantly (2.2261), then brakes hard (-2.7374 between 0.5 and 0.6 seconds), and continues braking heavily. This erratic behavior, combined with its proximity and same-lanelet position makes it a high risk obstacle.

Obstacle 30237 is also in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle and behind obstacle 30235. While initially further away, its behavior is also worth noting. It shows some acceleration fluctuations, but generally maintains a similar velocity to the ego vehicle, keeping a roughly constant distance. Its risk level is lower than 30235 due to the greater distance and less erratic behavior, but it still needs to be monitored.

Obstacles 30230 and 30231 are in different lanelets and exhibit varying acceleration patterns. Their trajectories don't pose an immediate threat to the ego vehicle given their current positions and directions relative to the ego vehicle's path. They are considered low risk.
