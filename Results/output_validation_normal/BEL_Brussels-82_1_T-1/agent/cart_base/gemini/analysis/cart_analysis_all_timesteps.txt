Obstacle 30235 is in the same lane as the ego vehicle (lanelet 122) and initially closer to the ego vehicle than obstacle 30237, also in the same lane.  Obstacle 30235's initial velocity is lower than the ego vehicle's but its acceleration fluctuates significantly, even becoming negative at one point while generally trending positive. This erratic acceleration behavior makes predicting its future motion and assessing collision risk challenging. Though the fluctuating acceleration makes the distance between the ego vehicle and obstacle 30235 vary, the distance is decreasing. Obstacle 30237, further behind the ego vehicle in the same lane, maintains a relatively steady velocity and acceleration making its risk lower than Obstacle 30235. Obstacles 30230 and 30231 are in different lanelets and don't pose an immediate threat based on their current trajectories.
