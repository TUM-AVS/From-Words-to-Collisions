Here's a breakdown of the collision analysis at t=0.9s:

**Ego Vehicle State (t=0.9s):**
* Position: (-463.2085, 254.5187)
* Orientation: -0.5450722325071107 rad
* Velocity: 4.9489 m/s
* Acceleration: -0.0854 m/s²
* Lanelet: 122.0

**Obstacles Analysis (t=0.9s):**

* **Obstacle 30230.0:**
    * Position: (-455.0086, 245.5752)
    * Orientation: -1.4668 rad
    * Velocity: 7.372 m/s
    * Acceleration: 1.7437 m/s²
    * Lanelet: 1321.0
    * Analysis: This obstacle is on a different lanelet and poses no immediate threat.  The lateral distance is significant, and the different lane assignments suggest diverging paths. Risk Score: 5

* **Obstacle 30231.0:**
    * Position: (-456.419, 231.828)
    * Orientation: -1.6541 rad
    * Velocity: 8.8975 m/s
    * Acceleration: 1.3396 m/s²
    * Lanelet: 290.0
    * Analysis:  Similar to 30230, this obstacle is on a different lanelet and far from the ego vehicle. Risk Score: 5

* **Obstacle 30235.0:**
    * Position: (-473.0244, 260.4679)
    * Orientation: -0.5448 rad
    * Velocity: 4.1676 m/s
    * Acceleration: -2.1934 m/s²
    * Lanelet: 122.0
    * Analysis:  This obstacle is in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle and ahead.  While the obstacle is decelerating, the current distance is safe. We need to monitor its deceleration rate in subsequent time steps, although it is unlikely to cause an immediate collision. Risk Score: 4

* **Obstacle 30237.0:**
    * Position: (-483.289, 266.6887)
    * Orientation: -0.5448 rad
    * Velocity: 4.3861 m/s
    * Acceleration: -0.9561 m/s²
    * Lanelet: 122.0
    * Analysis: Similar to 30235, this obstacle is also in the same lane but further ahead. Its deceleration is not concerning at this point. Risk Score: 5
