At t=0.9s, the ego vehicle (ID 30233) is at (-463.21, 254.52) with a velocity of 4.95 m/s and acceleration of -0.09 m/s².  Let's analyze the risk posed by each obstacle:

* **Obstacle 30230:** Located at (-455.01, 245.58), velocity 7.37 m/s, acceleration 1.74 m/s². This obstacle is in a different lanelet and moving away laterally. While it is closing longitudinally, the difference in y-coordinates and the lateral movement suggests low risk.

* **Obstacle 30231:**  Located at (-456.42, 231.83), velocity 8.90 m/s, acceleration 1.34 m/s². This obstacle is in a different lanelet with a significant lateral distance.  The large difference in y-coordinates implies low risk.

* **Obstacle 30235:** Located at (-473.02, 260.47), velocity 4.17 m/s, acceleration -2.19 m/s².  This obstacle is in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle.  The x-coordinate indicates it's ahead of the ego vehicle.  A rough TTC calculation using the 0.8s and 0.9s data points suggests the ego vehicle is closing in on this obstacle, though the negative acceleration of the obstacle might mitigate the risk. Further analysis with precise calculations is needed, but the situation presents a potential medium risk.

* **Obstacle 30237:** Located at (-483.29, 266.69), velocity 4.39 m/s, acceleration -0.96 m/s². This obstacle is also in the same lanelet and further ahead than obstacle 30235.  The trends suggest this obstacle is moving slower than the ego vehicle and might present a low risk.
