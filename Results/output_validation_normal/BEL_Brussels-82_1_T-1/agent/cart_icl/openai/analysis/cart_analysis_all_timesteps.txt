To analyze the potential collision scenarios, let's first focus on the latest positions and movements at 0.9 seconds.

### Analysis of 0.9s:

**Ego Vehicle (30233):**
- Position: (-463.2085, 254.5187)
- Velocity: 4.9489 m/s
- Acceleration: -0.0854 m/s²
- Lanelet: 122.0

**Obstacles:**

1. **Obstacle 30230:**
   - Position: (-455.0086, 245.5752)
   - Velocity: 7.372 m/s
   - Orientation: -1.4668 radians
   - Lanelet: 1321.0

2. **Obstacle 30231:**
   - Position: (-456.419, 231.828)
   - Velocity: 8.8975 m/s
   - Orientation: -1.6541 radians
   - Lanelet: 290.0

3. **Obstacle 30235:**
   - Position: (-473.0244, 260.4679)
   - Velocity: 4.1676 m/s
   - Orientation: -0.5448 radians
   - Lanelet: 122.0

4. **Obstacle 30237:**
   - Position: (-483.289, 266.6887)
   - Velocity: 4.3861 m/s
   - Orientation: -0.5448 radians
   - Lanelet: 122.0

### Evaluation:

**1. Obstacle 30230:**
- Relative position to Ego: Significant lateral separation, not in the same lanelet, moving away in a different direction.
- Risk Level: Low due to the different lanelet settings and course.

**2. Obstacle 30231:**
- Relative position to Ego: Far south from the Ego with different lanelet and course orientations. No immediate collision course.
- Risk Level: Low, nearly negligible risk.

**3. Obstacle 30235:**
- Relative position to Ego: Slightly ahead in a similar lanelet but with marginal distance.
- Distance Calculated: √((463.2085 - 473.0244)² + (254.5187 - 260.4679)²) = √(96.1069 + 35.3425) = √(131.4494) ≈ 11.46 meters.
- Risk Level: Medium, given the small separation distances in the same lanelet.

**4. Obstacle 30237:**
- Relative Position: Significantly behind Ego and in the same lanelet. 
- Distance Calculated: √((463.2085 - 483.289)² + (254.5187 - 266.6887)²) = √(402.5112 + 148.9965) = √(551.5077) ≈ 23.47 meters.
- Risk Level: Low, enough separation distance currently.

### Summary JSON Report
No obstacles have extremely high risk levels (0 or 1).

```json
{
    "CollisionObstacles": [],
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {},
    "HighRiskObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "30235",
        "OverallRiskScore": 3
    }
}
```
This JSON indicates no collision or extreme risk cases, and Obstacle 30235 is at a medium risk level due to proximity in the same lanelet.
