### Obstacle-by-Obstacle Analysis

#### Obstacle 30230 (Front-right)
- **Latest Position**: Longitudinal 7.14 m, Lateral -1.79 m
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal -0.49 m/s (approaching), Lateral -5.87 m/s (moving away)
- **Motion**: Driving toward ego longitudinally, moving away laterally to the right
- **Trajectory Analysis**: 
  - Longitudinal distance is decreasing (from 7.28m to 7.14m in 0.4s)
  - Lateral distance is increasing (from 0.00m to -1.79m in 0.5s)
- **TTC Calculation**: 
  - Longitudinal TTC = 7.14 / 0.49 ≈ 14.57s (No Risk)
  - Lateral TTC = Not applicable (moving away)
- **MDC**: 
  - Lateral distance is increasing, so MDC is the current lateral distance (1.79m)
  - Risk based on MDC: Medium Risk (1.0 < MDC ≤ 3.0m)
- **Overall Risk**: Medium Risk (3)

#### Obstacle 30231 (Front-right)
- **Latest Position**: Longitudinal 13.06 m, Lateral -14.27 m
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal -0.98 m/s (approaching), Lateral -7.97 m/s (moving away)
- **Motion**: Driving toward ego longitudinally, moving away laterally to the right
- **Trajectory Analysis**: 
  - Longitudinal distance is decreasing (from 13.56m to 13.06m in 0.4s)
  - Lateral distance is increasing (from -11.17m to -14.27m in 0.5s)
- **TTC Calculation**: 
  - Longitudinal TTC = 13.06 / 0.98 ≈ 13.33s (No Risk)
  - Lateral TTC = Not applicable (moving away)
- **MDC**: 
  - Lateral distance is increasing, so MDC is the current lateral distance (14.27m)
  - Risk based on MDC: No Risk (MDC > 5.0m)
- **Overall Risk**: No Risk (5)

#### Obstacle 30235 (Behind)
- **Latest Position**: Longitudinal -6.97 m, Lateral 0.00 m
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal -0.78 m/s (moving away), Lateral 0.00 m/s
- **Motion**: Moving away longitudinally, exact lateral alignment
- **Trajectory Analysis**: 
  - Longitudinal distance is increasing (from -6.79m to -6.97m in 0.2s)
  - Lateral distance remains 0.00m (same lane)
- **TTC Calculation**: 
  - Longitudinal TTC = Not applicable (moving away)
  - Lateral TTC = Not applicable (no lateral movement)
- **MDC**: 
  - Lateral distance is 0.00m, but no closing velocity
  - Risk based on MDC: No Risk (no collision trajectory)
- **Overall Risk**: No Risk (5)

#### Obstacle 30237 (Behind)
- **Latest Position**: Longitudinal -18.97 m, Lateral 0.00 m
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal -0.56 m/s (moving away), Lateral 0.00 m/s
- **Motion**: Moving away longitudinally, exact lateral alignment
- **Trajectory Analysis**: 
  - Longitudinal distance is increasing (from -18.79m to -18.97m in 0.2s)
  - Lateral distance remains 0.00m (same lane)
- **TTC Calculation**: 
  - Longitudinal TTC = Not applicable (moving away)
  - Lateral TTC = Not applicable (no lateral movement)
- **MDC**: 
  - Lateral distance is 0.00m, but no closing velocity
  - Risk based on MDC: No Risk (no collision trajectory)
- **Overall Risk**: No Risk (5)
