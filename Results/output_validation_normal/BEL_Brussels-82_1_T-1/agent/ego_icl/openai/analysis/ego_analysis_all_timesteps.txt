### Analysis of Each Obstacle at the Most Recent Timestep (0.9 seconds):

#### Obstacle 30230 (Front-right)
- **Adjusted Distances**: Longitudinal 7.14 m, Lateral -1.79 m
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal -0.49 m/s, Lateral -5.87 m/s
- **Motion Description**: Driving toward the ego car longitudinally, moving away laterally.
- **Trajectory**: The obstacle has been gradually moving closer longitudinally and laterally across time.
- **MDC & TTC Calculation**:
  - Since lateral velocity is higher and approaching, focus on lateral distance.
  - MDC for lateral distance: Risk relates primarily to the change in lateral distance.
  - TTC for longitudinal: Not immediately applicable due to very slow approach (-0.49 m/s).
  - **TTC (Lateral)**: \(1.79 \text{ m} / 5.87 \text{ m/s} = 0.30 \text{ s} \), indicating Extreme/High Risk.
  - **MDC (Lateral)** is closer to the High Risk level.
- **Risk Assessment**: High Risk (2) - due to lateral alignment risk, fast closing distance laterally, and potential collision if ego vehicle changes trajectory.

#### Obstacle 30231 (Front-right)
- **Adjusted Distances**: Longitudinal 13.06 m, Lateral -14.27 m
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal -0.98 m/s, Lateral -7.97 m/s
- **Motion Description**: Driving toward the ego car longitudinally, moving away laterally.
- **Trajectory**: Obstacle is closing in both dimensions slowly.
- **MDC & TTC Calculation**:
  - Focus on lateral aspect where obstacle is moving away, therefore, MDC increases.
  - **TTC (Longitudinal)**: \(13.06 \text{ m} / 0.98 \text{ m/s} = 13.33 \text{ s} \).
  - **TTC (Lateral)**: Not concerning as trajectory indicates overall moving away laterally.
- **Risk Assessment**: Negligible Risk (5) - No immediate threat due to distance and direction.

#### Obstacle 30235 (Behind)
- **Adjusted Distances**: Longitudinal -6.97 m, Lateral 0.00 m
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal -0.78 m/s, Lateral 0.00 m/s
- **Motion Description**: Moving away longitudinally.
- **Trajectory**: No significant change in distance over time.
- **MDC & TTC Calculation**:
  - Not closing in any direction; slowly increasing distance behind.
- **Risk Assessment**: Negligible Risk (5) - Moving away, no collision risk.

#### Obstacle 30237 (Behind)
- **Adjusted Distances**: Longitudinal -18.97 m, Lateral 0.00 m
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal -0.56 m/s, Lateral 0.00 m/s
- **Motion Description**: Moving away longitudinally.
- **Trajectory**: Similar to Obstacle 30235, demonstrating a non-threatening trajectory.
- **MDC & TTC Calculation**:
  - Tending away; no risk of collision.
- **Risk Assessment**: Negligible Risk (5) - No immediate or long-term threat.

### JSON Summary of Risk Assessment:

```json
{
    "CollisionObstacle": null,
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null,
    "HighRiskObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "30230",
        "OverallRiskScore": "2"
    }
}
```

### Overall Summary:
- **Obstacle 30230** poses the highest risk due to lateral closing distance, indicating a High Risk (2) scenario.
- All other obstacles either have distancing motion or are longitudinally slow-moving, categorizing them as negligible risks.
