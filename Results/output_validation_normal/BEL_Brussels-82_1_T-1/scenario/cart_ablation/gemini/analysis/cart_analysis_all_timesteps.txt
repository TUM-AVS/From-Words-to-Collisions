At t=0.9s, Ego is in lanelet 122.0 at (-463.2085, 254.5187).

Obstacle 30235 is in the same lanelet as Ego, at (-473.0244, 260.4679).  It's relatively close and moving towards Ego based on previous timestamps, its x position becoming less negative (approaching Ego from behind). Although its speed is decreasing, the rate of deceleration has fluctuated significantly in prior timestamps. Given the proximity and fluctuations in acceleration, there is a high risk of collision in the near future if Obstacle 30235 continues to approach Ego at a similar rate. Although not an *extreme* risk yet (risk score 1), this bears close observation.

Obstacle 30237 is also in the same lanelet, further behind Ego at (-483.289, 266.6887). Its trajectory shows movement towards Ego, and although the velocity isn't as high as 30235 and the acceleration is even negative currently, its consistent approach still merits attention for potential future risk. However, for this immediate timestep it is not a high risk.

Obstacles 30230 and 30231 are in different lanelets and pose no immediate threat based on their current trajectories.
