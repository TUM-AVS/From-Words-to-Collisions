Obstacle 30235 is in the same lane as the ego vehicle and shows a rapidly changing acceleration profile, going from +2.2261 at t=0.5s to -2.7374 at t=0.6s, and further decreasing to -2.1934 at t=0.9s. This erratic behavior makes its future trajectory unpredictable and increases the risk of collision, especially given its proximity to the ego vehicle.  While not an immediate collision at t=0.9s, the rapid deceleration of 30235 combined with its proximity and the ego vehicle's own deceleration suggests a high risk of collision in the very near future.

Obstacle 30237 is also in the same lane as the ego vehicle, and though its acceleration is fluctuating, it is less dramatically than 30235. However, this obstacle's proximity to the ego vehicle and the overall deceleration trend in both vehicles still warrants a high risk assessment.  A collision is not imminent at t=0.9s but is possible in the near future.
