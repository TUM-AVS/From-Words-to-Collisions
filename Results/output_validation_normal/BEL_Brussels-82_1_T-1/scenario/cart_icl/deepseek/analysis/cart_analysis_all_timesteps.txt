### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep (0.9 seconds):

### Obstacle Analysis:

1. **Obstacle ID: 30230.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Located in lanelet 1321.0, moving away from ego's lanelet (122.0). Distance is increasing over time.
   - **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: Relative velocity is positive (moving away), acceleration is positive but not threatening.
   - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 5

2. **Obstacle ID: 30231.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Located in lanelet 290.0, not in ego's lanelet. Distance is increasing over time.
   - **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: High velocity but moving away from ego's path.
   - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 5

3. **Obstacle ID: 30235.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Same lanelet as ego (122.0), but distance is decreasing slowly (~1.8m behind ego).
   - **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: Decelerating (-2.1934 m/s²), relative velocity is negative (approaching slowly).
   - **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 4

4. **Obstacle ID: 30237.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Same lanelet as ego (122.0), ~20m behind ego. Distance is decreasing slowly.
   - **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: Decelerating (-0.9561 m/s²), relative velocity is negative but small.
   - **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 4

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. No obstacles are in immediate collision path (risk scores ≥ 4).
2. Obstacles 30235.0 and 30237.0 are in the same lanelet but are far enough and decelerating.
3. Other obstacles are in different lanelets or moving away.
4. No collision or extreme risk detected.
