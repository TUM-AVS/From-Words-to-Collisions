- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Velocity difference suggests no immediate risk.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- Obstacle ID: 30238.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is in the same lanelet and moderately far from ego vehicle.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: Its velocity is higher than ego, but distance suggests no immediate risk.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3


### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
No obstacles have a risk score of 0, indicating no collision. Obstacle 30235.0 poses the highest risk with a score of 2 (high risk) due to its proximity and relative velocity/acceleration to the ego vehicle. Therefore, it's not a collision scenario but requires careful monitoring.

### Summary in JSON Format:
