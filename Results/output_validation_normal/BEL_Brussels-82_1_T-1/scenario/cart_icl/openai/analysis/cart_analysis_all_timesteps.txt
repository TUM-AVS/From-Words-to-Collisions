### Obstacle Analysis:

#### Obstacle 30230:
- **Distance Risk Reason**: The obstacle moved from the position relatively far from the ego vehicle to a closer proximity, now located in a different lanelet.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 4
- **Time Risk Reason**: The relative velocity compared to the ego is decreasing showing converging paths but not imminently enough for a collision.
- **Time Safety Score**: 3
- **Overall Risk Score**: 3

#### Obstacle 30231:
- **Distance Risk Reason**: Although showing a consistent trajectory towards the ego, it remains in a different lanelet and distance has been maintained.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 4
- **Time Risk Reason**: Consistent higher velocity relative to ego but sufficient distance mitigates immediate risk.
- **Time Safety Score**: 4
- **Overall Risk Score**: 4

#### Obstacle 30232:
- **Distance Risk Reason**: Consistently in a different lanelet, moving away from ego's path.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 5
- **Time Risk Reason**: Increasing distance over time, minimising collision risk with continued divergence in path.
- **Time Safety Score**: 5
- **Overall Risk Score**: 5

#### Obstacle 30235:
- **Distance Risk Reason**: Located in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle but ahead with enough distance to react.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 3
- **Time Risk Reason**: Slightly decreasing velocity relative to ego, not sufficiently convergent yet to indicate immediate collision.
- **Time Safety Score**: 3
- **Overall Risk Score**: 3

#### Obstacle 30236:
- **Distance Risk Reason**: Most distant from ego trajectories, consistent departure pattern.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 5
- **Time Risk Reason**: Rapid departure from path at a decreased velocity.
- **Time Safety Score**: 5
- **Overall Risk Score**: 5

#### Obstacle 30237:
- **Distance Risk Reason**: In the same lanelet and moving ahead of ego vehicle but maintains distance.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 3
- **Time Risk Reason**: Velocity changes indicate no immediate convergence.
- **Time Safety Score**: 3
- **Overall Risk Score**: 3

#### Obstacle 30238:
- **Distance Risk Reason**: Positioned in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle but showing sufficient relative distance.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 2
- **Time Risk Reason**: Decreasing velocity is a factor due to convergent paths although has not reduced enough to establish extreme risk.
- **Time Safety Score**: 2
- **Overall Risk Score**: 2

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
The scenario reveals that none of the obstacles present an immediate collision risk, as the minimum distance and relative velocities sufficiently prevent collision with effective time for evasive maneuvers. However, there's convergence potential particularly observed with obstacles in the same lanelet, indicating careful monitoring and planning to mitigate nearing risks.
