At t=0.9s, obstacle 30230 is in the front-right of the ego vehicle, moving away longitudinally and laterally to the right with a distance of 7.14m longitudinal and 1.79m lateral.  Obstacle 30231 is also in the front-right, moving away laterally to the right and towards the ego longitudinally, with a distance of 13.06m longitudinal and 14.27m lateral. Obstacles 30235 and 30237 are behind the ego vehicle and moving away longitudinally, posing no immediate risk. No obstacle shows an immediate risk of collision in the next timestep.

**Risk Levels and Definitions:**
<Collision (Score: 0)>: Actual collision has occurred or is unavoidable within the next timestep.
<Extreme Risk (Score: 1)>: Immediate collision or very high likelihood of impact. Urgent action is required.
<High Risk (Score: 2)>: Close to collision or highly probable collision path. Needs prompt attention and quick manoeuvring.
<Medium Risk (Score: 3)>: Moderate collision risk but manageable with timely reactions and proper strategies.
<Low Risk (Score: 4)>: Minimal collision risk. The situation is controllable with sufficient time to react.
<Negligible Risk (Score: 5)>: No significant collision risk. Obstacles are either moving away or far enough not to interfere.
