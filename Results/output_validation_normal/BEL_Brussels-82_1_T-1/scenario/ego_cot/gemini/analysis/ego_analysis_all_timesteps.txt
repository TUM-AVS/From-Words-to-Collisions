### Safety analysis for timestep 0.9 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

**Assumptions and Clarifications:**

* Since adjusted distances (adjusted_d_long, adjusted_d_lat) are not provided in the scenario context, the analysis will be solely based on the provided "real distance" (DTClong, DTClat) values.  This might lead to less precise risk assessments.
* TTC calculations require relative velocity and acceleration. However, constant velocity is assumed for simplification since accurately predicting future velocity based on a few data points is unreliable. 
* A simple distance-based risk assessment is employed due to the lack of vehicle dimensions and shape information.  7 meters is considered a reasonably safe longitudinal distance, and 5 meters a safe lateral distance. These thresholds would ideally be determined based on specific vehicle characteristics and safety margins.

### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 30230**
- Distance Risk reason: Located in the Front-right with DTClong of 7.14m and DTClat 7.14m. Relatively close, especially laterally.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Moving towards the ego vehicle longitudinally (-0.49 m/s) and away laterally (-5.87 m/s). The longitudinal motion slightly increases risk.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 30231**
- Distance Risk reason: Located in the Front-right at DTClong 13.06m and DTClat 13.06m.  Safe distance.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Moving towards the ego vehicle longitudinally (-0.98 m/s) and away laterally (-7.97 m/s). Lateral motion reduces risk, while longitudinal motion poses some concern, but the distance is sufficient for now.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 30235**
- Distance Risk reason: Behind the ego vehicle with DTClong -6.97m and DTClat -6.97m. Reasonably safe distance.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Moving away from the ego vehicle longitudinally (-0.78 m/s). No lateral relative velocity.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 30237**
- Distance Risk reason: Located behind the ego vehicle at DTClong -18.97m and DTClat -18.97m.  Safe distance.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Moving away from the ego vehicle longitudinally (-0.56 m/s) and no lateral movement.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5
