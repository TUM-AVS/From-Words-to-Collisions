### Obstacle Analysis

**Obstacle 30230**

- **Position and Movement:**
  - At the most recent timestep (0.9 seconds), the adjusted distances are not specified, but longitudinal and lateral distances are given as 7.14 m (longitudinal) and -1.79 m (lateral).
  - The obstacle is front-right of the ego vehicle and moving longitudinally towards the ego vehicle while laterally moving away as indicated by a -5.87 m/s lateral relative velocity.

- **TTC and MDC Calculations:**
  - **Longitudinal TTC:** |7.14 m|/|0.49 m/s| = 14.57 seconds.
  - **Lateral TTC:** Since the obstacle is moving laterally away, TTC is irrelevant.
  - **MDC:** Both adjusted distances are not directly provided, but considering the relative distances and trajectories, it's clearly larger than 1.0 meters as the obstacle is moving away laterally.

- **Risk Assessment:**
  - The obstacle is moving away laterally and does not pose an immediate threat.
  - Risk Score: 5 (No Risk)

**Obstacle 30231**

- **Position and Movement:**
  - At the most recent timestep (0.9 seconds), the adjusted distances are not specified, but longitudinal and lateral distances are given as 13.06 m (longitudinal) and -14.27 m (lateral).
  - The obstacle is in the front-right and approaching the ego vehicle longitudinally (-0.98 m/s) with lateral component also moving away (-7.97 m/s).

- **TTC and MDC Calculations:**
  - **Longitudinal TTC:** |13.06 m|/|0.98 m/s| = 13.32 seconds.
  - **Lateral TTC**: With a lateral velocity moving away, TTC is irrelevant.
  - **MDC:** Based on distance and trajectory, relatively safe with significant distance on both axes.

- **Risk Assessment:**
  - No immediate risk due to sufficient separation and diverging lateral trajectories.
  - Risk Score: 5 (No Risk)

**Obstacle 30235**

- **Position and Movement:**
  - At the most recent timestep (0.9 seconds), the adjusted distances are not specified, but it is referenced at longitudinal -6.97 m (behind) with exact lateral alignment.
  - The relative longitudinal velocity is -0.78 m/s indicating moving away from the ego vehicle.

- **TTC and MDC Calculations:**
  - **Longitudinal TTC:** Not applicable, as the obstacle is moving away.
  - **MDC:** Since the obstacle is aligned longitudinally further than MDC for any medium risk score, itâ€™s not an immediate concern.

- **Risk Assessment:**
  - Due to separation and diverging motion, this obstacle does not pose a collision threat.
  - Risk Score: 5 (No Risk)

**Obstacle 30237**

- **Position and Movement:**
  - At the most recent timestep (0.9 seconds), the adjusted distances are similarly not specified, longitudinally -18.97 m (behind) with exact lateral alignment.
  - Relative velocity is -0.56 m/s indicating it continues to move away longitudinally.

- **TTC and MDC Calculations:**
  - **Longitudinal TTC:** Not applicable, as the obstacle is moving away.
  - **MDC:** Given the significant longitudinal separation and trajectory, not given high risk consideration.

- **Risk Assessment:**
  - Moving away, no threat of immediate collision.
  - Risk Score: 5 (No Risk)

### Scenario Conclusion

Based on the analysis of the most recent timestep, no obstacles have immediate risk factors indicating a potential collision. All obstacles present a risk score of 5, indicating "No Risk." Therefore, this is not a collision scenario.
