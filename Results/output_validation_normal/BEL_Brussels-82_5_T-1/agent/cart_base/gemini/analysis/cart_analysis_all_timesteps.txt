Obstacle 30233 is in the same lane as the ego vehicle and its x-coordinate is getting closer to the ego vehicle's x-coordinate over time.  The initial distance is large but closing rapidly. This represents a potential collision risk if the trend continues. Obstacle 30235 is also in the same lane as the ego vehicle, further behind 30233, and also approaching, making it a potential risk further out in time if both vehicles maintain their course and speed. Obstacle 30231 is in a different lane and poses no immediate threat.

Based on the provided data, obstacle 30233 represents a high risk due to its proximity and closing velocity relative to the ego vehicle. It's crucial to monitor this obstacle closely. While obstacle 30235 is also approaching, the current distance provides more time to react, thus posing a medium risk. Obstacle 30231 does not pose an immediate risk due to its different lane.
