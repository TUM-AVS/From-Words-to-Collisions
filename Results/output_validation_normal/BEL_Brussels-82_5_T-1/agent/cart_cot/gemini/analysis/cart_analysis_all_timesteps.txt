At t=0.9s, the ego vehicle is at (-460.6416, 252.9697) with a velocity of 5.9664 and acceleration of 0.6464. Let's analyze the risk posed by each obstacle:

* **Obstacle 30231.0:** Position (-454.9825, 244.1257), velocity 6.559, acceleration 2.1898, in lanelet 1321.  This obstacle is in a different lanelet (1321 vs. ego's 122), suggesting a lower risk of collision. While it's spatially the closest obstacle, the differing lanelets mean the vehicles' paths aren't likely to directly intersect immediately.  Further calculations would be needed if the lanelets are merging soon, but based on current information the risk appears low.

* **Obstacle 30233.0:** Position (-470.149, 258.7253), velocity 4.1641, acceleration 1.6524, in lanelet 122. This obstacle is in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle and is behind it. The obstacle's velocity is lower than the ego's, making a rear-end collision by the ego unlikely.  The risk is considered negligible based on the presented data.

* **Obstacle 30235.0:** Position (-480.9598, 265.2771), velocity 4.6827, acceleration -0.4069, in lanelet 122.  This obstacle is also in the ego's lanelet, but further behind than Obstacle 30233, making an immediate collision even less likely. Risk is negligible.


Based on the available data at t=0.9s, none of the obstacles pose an immediate collision risk.  However, more advanced analysis (like Time-To-Collision (TTC) and Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC)) is needed for a complete safety assessment, especially regarding Obstacle 30231 in the adjacent lanelet.  The provided data doesn't give enough context about the lanelets' geometry or the vehicles' intended paths.
