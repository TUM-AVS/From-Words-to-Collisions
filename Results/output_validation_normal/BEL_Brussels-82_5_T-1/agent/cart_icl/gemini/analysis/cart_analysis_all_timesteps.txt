At t=0.9s, let's analyze the risk posed by each obstacle to the ego vehicle (ID 30230).

**Obstacle 30231:** This obstacle is in a different lanelet (1321) than the ego vehicle (122), and the lateral distance appears significant based on their Y-coordinates.  While the X-coordinates suggest the obstacle is slightly ahead, the different lanelets mitigate the risk.  Therefore, the risk associated with this obstacle is considered negligible.

**Obstacle 30233:** This obstacle is in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle. At t=0.9s, the obstacle's position is (-470.15, 258.73) and the ego's is (-460.64, 252.97).  The obstacle is ahead of the ego vehicle, and both are moving in roughly the same direction (similar orientations). Calculating the distance:

* Δx = -470.15 - (-460.64) = -9.51m (Ego is behind)
* Δy = 258.73 - 252.97 = 5.76m (Lateral offset)
* Distance = sqrt((-9.51)^2 + (5.76)^2) ≈ 11.08m


A rough estimate of TTC, using only longitudinal velocities (for simplification, we'll assume constant velocity), is challenging without clear relative velocity information. However, given the distance and that both are moving in a similar direction, a collision is unlikely in the immediate future.  While more precise velocity and acceleration analysis would be beneficial for a definitive TTC, the current data suggests a medium risk.

**Obstacle 30235:**  This obstacle is in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle. Its position is (-480.96, 265.28) compared to ego's (-460.64, 252.97).

* Δx = -480.96 - (-460.64) = -20.32m (Ego is behind)
* Δy = 265.28 - 252.97 = 12.31m (Significant lateral offset)
* Distance = sqrt((-20.32)^2 + (12.31)^2) ≈ 23.74m

Again, without detailed relative velocity information, a precise TTC is difficult. However, considering the relatively large distance and lateral offset, this obstacle presents a low risk.
