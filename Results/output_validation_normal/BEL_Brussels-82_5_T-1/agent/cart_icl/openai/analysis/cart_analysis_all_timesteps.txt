### Analysis

#### Overview at 0.9 seconds:
The ego vehicle (30230.0) has shifted slightly towards the left from its initial path and has increased its speed to 5.9664 m/s with minimal lateral change. The ego vehicle continues in lanelet 122.0.

- **Obstacle 30231.0**:
  - Location: Signs of moving into lanelet 1321.0. Positioned south-east of the ego vehicle with a slightly sharper angle compared to the ego vehicle's travel.
  - Velocity: 6.559 m/s, accelerating at 2.1898 m/s²
  - With a lateral distance of approximately 8.843 m and velocity suggesting continued separation, the risk remained negligible.

- **Obstacle 30233.0**:
  - Location: Ahead in lanelet 122.0.
  - Velocity: 4.1641 m/s, with a steady acceleration.
  - Remaining within ego's lanelet, but given its modest speed and positioning 9.507 m diagonally ahead, the risk remains low.

- **Obstacle 30235.0**:
  - Location: Further north in the same lanelet.
  - Velocity: 4.6827 m/s, decelerating slightly at -0.4069 m/s².
  - Current longitudinal and lateral distance maintained adequately (approximately 20.3182 m diagonally ahead), suggesting a low risk.
  
Given this positioning and velocities, the immediate collision risk remains low for all assessed obstacles. However, trend analysis reveals consistent deceleration rates, with obstacle 30233 maintaining slower acceleration. If ego maintains a constant rate of increase in speed, monitoring for such decelerating objects closer in proximity would be prudent.

### Risk Assessment

- **Obstacle 30231**: Maintains a stable distance and resides in a separate lane, with no immediate threat of path crossing imminent. **Negligible risk** (5).
- **Obstacle 30233**: While decelerating, its trajectory aligns with the ego. Yet, the lanelet clearance remains adequate, maintaining distance. **Low risk** (4).
- **Obstacle 30235**: In shared lanelet but maintains a safe distance ahead. **Low risk** (4).

There are no immediate collision risks at the current trajectory and speed. The ego car should continue to maintain vigilance, with priority to obstacles 30233 and 30235.
