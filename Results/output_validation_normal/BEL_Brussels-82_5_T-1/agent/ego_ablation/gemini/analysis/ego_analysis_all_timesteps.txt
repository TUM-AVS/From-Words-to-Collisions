At t=0.9s, Obstacle 30231 is the only obstacle that requires further analysis.  It's approaching the ego vehicle longitudinally, with a decreasing longitudinal distance (4.86m) and a relative longitudinal velocity of -2.79 m/s (moving towards the ego). However, it's also moving laterally to the right, increasing the lateral distance to -3.12m with a velocity of -5.74 m/s. While the longitudinal motion presents a potential risk, the significant lateral movement suggests the obstacle is likely changing lanes and might not pose an immediate collision risk. Given the current information, it's classified as a medium risk.  The other obstacles are moving away from the ego vehicle and present no immediate risk.
