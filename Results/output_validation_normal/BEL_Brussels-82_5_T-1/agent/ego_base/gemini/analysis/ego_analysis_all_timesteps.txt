At t=0.9s:
- **Obstacle 30231 (Front-right):**  Longitudinal distance is decreasing rapidly (4.86m) and lateral distance is increasing (-3.12m), indicating the obstacle is moving to the front-right and getting closer longitudinally.  The relative longitudinal velocity is -2.79 m/s (towards ego) and lateral velocity is -5.74 m/s. This obstacle presents a potential risk due to the decreasing longitudinal distance but might not pose an immediate collision risk given the lateral movement. Classify as Medium risk (3).

- **Obstacle 30233 (Behind):**  Longitudinal distance is -6.61m and lateral distance is 0.00m. The relative longitudinal velocity is -1.80 m/s (away from ego). This obstacle poses negligible risk (5).

- **Obstacle 30235 (Behind):** Longitudinal distance is -19.25m and lateral distance is 0.00m. The relative longitudinal velocity is -1.28 m/s (away from ego). This obstacle poses negligible risk (5).
