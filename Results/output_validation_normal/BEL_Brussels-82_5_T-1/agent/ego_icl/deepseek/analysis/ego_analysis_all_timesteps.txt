Let me analyze each obstacle at the most recent timestep (0.9 seconds):

1. Obstacle 30231 (Front-right):
- Position: Longitudinal 4.86m, Lateral -3.12m
- Velocity: Longitudinal -2.79m/s (approaching), Lateral -5.74m/s (moving away)
- Trajectory: Moving toward ego longitudinally but away laterally to the right
- TTC (longitudinal): 4.86/2.79 = 1.74s (Medium Risk)
- MDC: Lateral distance increasing (3.12m), so focus on longitudinal (4.86m - Low Risk)
- Overall Risk: Medium (3) - primary concern is longitudinal approach

2. Obstacle 30233 (Behind):
- Position: Longitudinal -6.61m, Lateral 0.00m
- Velocity: Longitudinal -1.80m/s (moving away), Lateral -0.04m/s
- Trajectory: Moving away longitudinally, stable laterally
- TTC: Not applicable (moving away)
- MDC: 6.61m (No Risk)
- Overall Risk: Negligible (5)

3. Obstacle 30235 (Behind):
- Position: Longitudinal -19.25m, Lateral 0.00m
- Velocity: Longitudinal -1.28m/s (moving away), Lateral -0.05m/s
- Trajectory: Moving away in both dimensions
- TTC: Not applicable (moving away)
- MDC: 19.25m (No Risk)
- Overall Risk: Negligible (5)

Trajectory Analysis:
- 30231 shows concerning longitudinal approach but safe lateral separation
- Both rear obstacles are moving away from ego
- No collision or extreme risk situations
