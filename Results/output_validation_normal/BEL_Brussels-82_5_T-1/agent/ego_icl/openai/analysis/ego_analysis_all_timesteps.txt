### Obstacle Analysis

#### Obstacle 30231 (Front-right)
- **Previous Trajectory**: Moving toward the ego car longitudinally and away laterally.
- **Adjusted Distances** (Latest Time Step):
  - Longitudinal: 4.86 m
  - Lateral: -3.12 m
- **Relative Velocities**:
  - Longitudinal: -2.79 m/s (approaching)
  - Lateral: -5.74 m/s (moving away)
- **TTC Calculations**:
  - Longitudinal TTC = 4.86 m / 2.79 m/s â‰ˆ 1.74 seconds
  - Lateral trajectory moving away, hence not critical for collision.
  
- **Risk Analysis**:
  - Longitudinal TTC (1.74 s) places this in the Medium Risk category.
  - MDC could be in Medium Risk (1.5-3 meters) due to the trajectory, but both longitudinal and lateral components are separating paths.
  - **Risk Score**: Medium Risk (3)

#### Obstacle 30233 (Behind)
- **Previous Trajectory**: Consistently moving away from the ego vehicle.
- **Adjusted Distances** (Latest Time Step):
  - Longitudinal: -6.61 m (behind)
  - Lateral: 0.00 m (same lane)
- **Relative Velocities**:
  - Longitudinal: -1.80 m/s (moving away)
  - Lateral: -0.04 m/s (ignorable for longitudinal separation)
- **Risk Analysis**:
  - As the obstacle is moving away longitudinally, the risk is negligible.
  
- **Risk Score**: Negligible Risk (5)

#### Obstacle 30235 (Behind)
- **Previous Trajectory**: Generally stationary or moving away from the ego car.
- **Adjusted Distances** (Latest Time Step):
  - Longitudinal: -19.25 m (behind)
  - Lateral: 0.00 m (same lane)
- **Relative Velocities**:
  - Longitudinal: -1.28 m/s (moving away)
  - Lateral: -0.05 m/s (ignorable for longitudinal separation)
- **Risk Analysis**:
  - With the distance increasing and the obstacle moving away, the risk is negligible.
  
- **Risk Score**: Negligible Risk (5)
