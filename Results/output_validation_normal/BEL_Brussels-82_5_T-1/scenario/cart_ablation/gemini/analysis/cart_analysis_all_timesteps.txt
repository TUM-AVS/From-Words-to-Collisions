At t=0.9s, Ego is in lanelet 122.0 at (-460.6416, 252.9697).

* Obstacle 30231.0 is in lanelet 1321.0 at (-454.9825, 244.1257). While the y-coordinate difference suggests some lateral separation, the x-coordinates are relatively close. However, the trajectory history of this obstacle suggests it's moving away from the ego vehicle and into a different lanelet. Therefore, this is not considered an immediate collision risk.

* Obstacle 30233.0 is in the same lanelet as Ego (122.0) at (-470.149, 258.7253).  This obstacle is behind Ego and moving slower. The distance is not closing rapidly based on the previous timesteps, therefore not an immediate risk.

* Obstacle 30235.0 is in the same lanelet as Ego (122.0) at (-480.9598, 265.2771). This obstacle is significantly behind Ego and poses no immediate risk.
