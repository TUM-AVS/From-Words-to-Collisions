At t=0.9s, Ego is in lanelet 122.0 at (-460.6416, 252.9697).

Obstacle 30231.0 is in lanelet 1321.0 at (-454.9825, 244.1257). While the y-coordinate difference suggests some lateral separation, the x-coordinates indicate this obstacle is closing in rapidly from behind.  Given the converging trajectories and different lanelets (implying a potential lane change maneuver by the obstacle), this represents an extreme risk.

Obstacle 30233.0 is in the same lanelet as Ego at (-470.149, 258.7253).  It's ahead of the Ego and moving slower, decreasing collision risk.

Obstacle 30235.0 is in the same lanelet as Ego at (-480.9598, 265.2771).  This obstacle is significantly ahead of the Ego and poses no immediate threat.
