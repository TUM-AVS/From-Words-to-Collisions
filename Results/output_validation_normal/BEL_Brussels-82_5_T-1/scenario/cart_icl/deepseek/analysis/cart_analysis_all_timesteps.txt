### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:
- **Obstacle ID: 30231.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is in a different lanelet (1321.0) and moving away from the ego vehicle's lanelet (122.0). The distance has been increasing over time.
  - **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: The obstacle is accelerating away from the ego vehicle's path, with a high velocity (6.559) and positive acceleration (2.1898).
  - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 30233.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is in the same lanelet (122.0) as the ego vehicle and is moving in the same direction. The distance between them is decreasing but still significant (~9.5m).
  - **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: The obstacle's velocity (4.1641) is lower than the ego's (5.9664), and the relative velocity is small. The acceleration trend shows moderate increase.
  - **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 30235.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is in the same lanelet (122.0) as the ego vehicle and is moving in the same direction. The distance (~20.3m) is large and increasing slightly.
  - **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: The obstacle's velocity (4.6827) is lower than the ego's (5.9664), and the acceleration is slightly negative (-0.4069).
  - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. **Obstacle 30231.0**: Not in the same lanelet and moving away. No collision risk.
2. **Obstacle 30233.0**: In the same lanelet but distance is decreasing slowly. Low risk due to manageable relative velocity.
3. **Obstacle 30235.0**: In the same lanelet but distance is large and increasing. No risk.
4. No obstacles are on a collision course (risk score 0 or 1).
