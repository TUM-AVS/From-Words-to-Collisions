### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 30231.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is in a different lanelet and poses no immediate threat.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason:  Relative velocities and trajectories suggest no imminent collision.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 30232.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is far away and in a different lanelet.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason:  No risk based on current trajectories and velocities.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 30233.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is in the same lanelet but sufficiently behind.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason:  The ego vehicle is moving faster, increasing the separation.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- Obstacle ID: 30235.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is in the same lanelet and ahead, but the separation is significant.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Relative velocity is small, maintaining safe separation.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- Obstacle ID: 30236.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is far away and in a different lanelet.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Trajectory poses no immediate risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
This is not a collision scenario. No obstacle is on a direct collision course with the ego vehicle at the latest timestep.  All obstacles are either in different lanelets or maintain a safe distance and velocity profile relative to the ego vehicle.
