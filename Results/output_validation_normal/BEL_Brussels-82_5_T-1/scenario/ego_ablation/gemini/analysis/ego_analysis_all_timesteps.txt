Obstacle 30231 is moving away laterally to the right and is not an immediate collision risk despite moving towards the ego car longitudinally.  Obstacles 30233 and 30235 are moving away from the ego car and pose no immediate risk. Although obstacle 30231 is getting closer longitudinally, its lateral movement suggests it's unlikely to collide with the ego vehicle in the next timestep.
