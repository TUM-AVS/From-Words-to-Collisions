At t=0.9s, Obstacle 30231 is in the front-right, moving closer longitudinally and laterally away to the right.  It's the closest obstacle at 4.86m longitudinal and 3.12m lateral distance. Although approaching longitudinally, its lateral movement suggests it might be turning away, reducing immediate collision risk, though continued monitoring is crucial. Obstacles 30233 and 30235 are behind the ego vehicle and moving away, posing negligible risk.

**Risk Levels and Definitions:**
<Collision (Score: 0)>: Actual collision has occurred or is unavoidable within the next timestep.
<Extreme Risk (Score: 1)>: Immediate collision or very high likelihood of impact. Urgent action is required.
<High Risk (Score: 2)>: Close to collision or highly probable collision path. Needs prompt attention and quick manoeuvring.
<Medium Risk (Score: 3)>: Moderate collision risk but manageable with timely reactions and proper strategies.
<Low Risk (Score: 4)>: Minimal collision risk. The situation is controllable with sufficient time to react.
<Negligible Risk (Score: 5)>: No significant collision risk. Obstacles are either moving away or far enough not to interfere.
