### Safety analysis for timestep 0.9 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID:** 30231
- **Distance Risk reason:**  The obstacle is in the front-right, with a longitudinal distance of 4.86m and a lateral distance of 4.86m. This is a moderately close distance, requiring attention.
- **Distance safety score:** 3 (Medium Risk)
- **Time Risk reason:**  The obstacle's longitudinal velocity is negative, indicating it's moving towards the ego vehicle.  The lateral velocity is also negative, suggesting it is moving to the right, which decreases lateral risk.  However, we don't have enough information to calculate exact TTC values without knowing the ego vehicle's speed and size for adjusted distances. Based on the decreasing longitudinal distance and negative relative velocity, there is some temporal risk.
- **Time safety score:** 3 (Medium Risk)
- **Overall Risk score:** 3 (Medium Risk)

- **Obstacle ID:** 30233
- **Distance Risk reason:** The obstacle is behind the ego vehicle at a safe longitudinal distance of -6.61m and lateral distance of -6.61m. The negative values indicate it's behind and not posing an immediate threat.
- **Distance safety score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)
- **Time Risk reason:**  The obstacle is moving further away longitudinally with a negative relative velocity. This indicates no temporal risk of collision.
- **Time safety score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)
- **Overall Risk score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)

- **Obstacle ID:** 30235
- **Distance Risk reason:** The obstacle is behind the ego vehicle at a safe longitudinal distance of -19.25m and lateral distance of -19.25m. This poses no immediate spatial risk.
- **Distance safety score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)
- **Time Risk reason:**  The obstacle is moving further away longitudinally with a negative relative velocity. This poses no temporal risk.
- **Time safety score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)
- **Overall Risk score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)


### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
  "CollisionObstacle": null,
  "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null,
  "IsCollisionScenario": false,
  "Justification": "No obstacle poses an immediate collision risk. Obstacle 30231 requires monitoring due to its moderately close proximity and movement towards the ego vehicle, but the lateral movement reduces risk."
}
