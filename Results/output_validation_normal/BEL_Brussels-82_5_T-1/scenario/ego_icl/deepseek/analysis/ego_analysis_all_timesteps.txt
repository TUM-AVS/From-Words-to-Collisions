Let me analyze each obstacle at the most recent timestep (0.9 seconds) and assess collision risks:

1. Obstacle 30231 (Front-right):
- Adjusted distances: longitudinal 4.86m, lateral -3.12m
- Relative velocity: longitudinal -2.79 m/s (approaching), lateral -5.74 m/s (moving away)
- Motion: Driving toward ego longitudinally, moving away laterally to right
- MDC Analysis: 
  - Lateral distance increasing (moving away), so focus on longitudinal risk
  - Longitudinal distance decreasing at 2.79 m/s
  - Current longitudinal distance (4.86m) > 3.0m → initially Low Risk (4)
  - TTC = 4.86/2.79 = 1.74s → Medium Risk (3)
  - Overall Risk: Medium (3)

2. Obstacle 30233 (Behind):
- Adjusted distances: longitudinal -6.61m, lateral 0.00m
- Relative velocity: longitudinal -1.80 m/s (moving away), lateral -0.04 m/s
- Motion: Moving away longitudinally
- MDC Analysis:
  - Both distances increasing (negative relative velocity)
  - No collision path → No Risk (5)

3. Obstacle 30235 (Behind):
- Adjusted distances: longitudinal -19.25m, lateral 0.00m
- Relative velocity: longitudinal -1.28 m/s (moving away), lateral -0.05 m/s
- Motion: Moving away longitudinally
- MDC Analysis:
  - Both distances increasing (negative relative velocity)
  - No collision path → No Risk (5)

Trajectory Analysis:
- Obstacle 30231 shows concerning longitudinal approach but with increasing lateral separation
- Other obstacles are moving away from ego vehicle
- No actual collisions (distance > 0) or extreme risks (TTC > 0.5s, MDC > 0.5m)

Final Assessment:
No obstacles meet collision (0) or extreme risk (1) criteria. The highest risk is Obstacle 30231 with Medium Risk (3).
