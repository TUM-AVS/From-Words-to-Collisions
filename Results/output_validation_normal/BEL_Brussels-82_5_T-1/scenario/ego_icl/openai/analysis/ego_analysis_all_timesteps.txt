### Obstacle-by-Obstacle Analysis

#### Obstacle 30231
- **Adjusted Position (Most Recent Timestep, 0.9s)**
  - Longitudinal: 4.86 m
  - Lateral: -3.12 m
- **Relative Velocity**
  - Longitudinal: -2.79 m/s
  - Lateral: -5.74 m/s
- **Motion Description**
  - Driving toward the ego car longitudinally.
  - Moving away laterally to the right.

**Trajectory Analysis**:
- **Longitudinal Distance** is decreasing over time, indicating the obstacle is approaching the ego vehicle longitudinally.
- **Lateral Distance** is also decreasing as the obstacle moves from a front-right position towards more alignment.

**TTC and MDC Calculations**:
- **Longitudinal TTC**: \( \frac{4.86}{|-2.79|} = 1.74 \, \text{s} \)
- **Lateral TTC**: \( \frac{3.12}{|-5.74|} = 0.54 \, \text{s} \)
  
**Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC)**:
- The lateral distance decreasing to 3.12 m is the most concerning since it's moving towards lateral alignment.

**Risk Assessment**:
- **MDC**: Between 1.0 and 3.0 meters => Medium Risk
- **TTC (Lateral)**: Between 0.5 and 1.0 seconds => High Risk
- The higher risk score from lateral TTC dictates the assessment.
- **Overall Risk Score**: 2 (High Risk)

#### Obstacle 30233
- **Adjusted Position (Most Recent Timestep, 0.9s)**
  - Longitudinal: -6.61 m
  - Lateral: 0.00 m
- **Relative Velocity**
  - Longitudinal: -1.80 m/s
  - Lateral: -0.04 m/s
- **Motion Description**
  - Moving away longitudinally.

**Trajectory Analysis**:
- **Longitudinal Distance** is increasing, showing the obstacle is moving away.

**TTC and MDC Calculations**:
- **Longitudinal TTC**: Not applicable as the obstacle is moving away.
  
**Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC)**:
- MDC remains the lateral alignment distance (0.00 m), but with the obstacle moving away, this does not indicate immediate risk.

**Risk Assessment**:
- **Overall Risk Score**: 5 (No Risk)

#### Obstacle 30235
- **Adjusted Position (Most Recent Timestep, 0.9s)**
  - Longitudinal: -19.25 m
  - Lateral: 0.00 m
- **Relative Velocity**
  - Longitudinal: -1.28 m/s
  - Lateral: -0.05 m/s
- **Motion Description**
  - Moving away longitudinally.

**Trajectory Analysis**:
- **Longitudinal Distance** is increasing, obstacle is distant and moving away.

**TTC and MDC Calculations**:
- **Longitudinal TTC**: Not applicable as the obstacle is moving away.
  
**Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC)**:
- Lateral alignment (0.00 m) with the obstacle moving away signifies no immediate threat.

**Risk Assessment**:
- **Overall Risk Score**: 5 (No Risk)

### Conclusion

Given the above analyses, only Obstacle 30231 poses a significant risk due to its high-risk score based on lateral convergence. However, it does not fit the criteria for a collision or extreme risk scenario as set out (risk score 0 or 1).
