Obstacle 30299 starts relatively far from the ego vehicle but its y-coordinate is consistently decreasing, indicating it is moving closer to the ego vehicle.  Over the provided timesteps, the distance between the two vehicles shrinks, suggesting a potential collision risk if this trend continues. Initially, it is on lanelet 1084, then transitions to 523 and finally to 1083.  These lanelets appear to be close to the ego vehicle's lanelet (130 & 846). The continuous decrease in y-coordinate of obstacle 30299 coupled with lane changes raises concern of a potential future collision. It currently poses a medium risk, but further analysis is required to determine if it transitions to a high risk.

Obstacle 30300 also begins far from the ego vehicle but its y-coordinate consistently decreases over the timesteps. This closing distance indicates a potential risk. Initially, it resides in lanelet -1 (which indicates an unknown or invalid lanelet), then switches to lanelet 1084. Its proximity to the ego vehicle, coupled with a decreasing distance between them, makes it a medium risk and may require attention in the near future.

The other obstacles do not appear to pose immediate high risks, but continuous monitoring is necessary.
