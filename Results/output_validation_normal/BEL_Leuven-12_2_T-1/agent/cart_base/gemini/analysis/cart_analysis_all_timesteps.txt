Obstacle 30299 is initially located behind the ego vehicle but is approaching rapidly with a higher acceleration.  While not an immediate collision risk at 0.9 seconds, the closing distance and speed difference warrant close monitoring. Obstacle 30300 is located further behind the ego vehicle and poses less of a risk in the immediate future. Other obstacles are located in different lanelets and do not present an immediate risk based on the provided trajectory information. However, obstacle 30297 shows highly erratic acceleration changes, suggesting unpredictable behavior. While not immediately risky, this warrants further observation. Obstacle 30296 is moving away from the ego vehicle and poses no risk.
