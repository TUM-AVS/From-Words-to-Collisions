Here's the collision risk analysis for the provided scenario focusing on the last timestep (0.9 seconds).

**Scenario at 0.9 seconds:**

* **Ego:** Position (-166.691, 107.8791), Orientation -1.773, Velocity 6.4078, Acceleration -0.1535, Lanelet 846.0
* **Obstacle 30296:** Position (-166.6292, 84.012), Orientation -0.2402, Velocity 8.8257, Acceleration 1.9564, Lanelet 807.0
* **Obstacle 30297:** Position (-171.7124, 94.488), Orientation -2.0631, Velocity 6.3434, Acceleration -0.1701, Lanelet 1081.0
* **Obstacle 30299:** Position (-164.9916, 121.4069), Orientation -1.6246, Velocity 6.3826, Acceleration -0.0575, Lanelet 1083.0
* **Obstacle 30300:** Position (-164.8025, 132.3353), Orientation -1.5629, Velocity 4.1781, Acceleration 1.37, Lanelet 1084.0

**Analysis:**

1. **Obstacle 30296:**  While this obstacle is spatially the closest to the ego vehicle at this timestep, the y-coordinate difference suggests they are in different lanes and the orientations indicate they are moving in different directions.  Given the current velocities and accelerations, a collision is unlikely in the immediate future. The risk level can be assessed as low (4).

2. **Obstacle 30297:** This obstacle is further away from the ego vehicle and also seemingly moving in a different direction. The risk level can be assessed as negligible (5).

3. **Obstacle 30299:** This obstacle is ahead of the ego vehicle and slightly to the right in terms of X position, but the difference in the y coordinates could mean different lanes. There seems some potential for interaction due to the similar x position and speed though. Risk level: Medium (3)

4. **Obstacle 30300:** This obstacle is the furthest ahead of the ego vehicle and further to the right. It poses no immediate risk. Risk level: Negligible (5).
