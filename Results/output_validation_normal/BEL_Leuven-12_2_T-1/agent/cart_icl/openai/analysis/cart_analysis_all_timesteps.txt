Based on the most recent timestep at 0.9 seconds, let's evaluate the scenario carefully:

### Assessment of Ego Vehicle and Obstacles:

1. **Ego Vehicle (30298):**
   - Position: (-166.691, 107.8791)
   - Orientation: -1.7733
   - Velocity: 6.4078 m/s
   - Acceleration: -0.1535 m/s²
   - Lanelet: 846.0

2. **Obstacle 30296:**
   - Position: (-166.6292, 84.012)
   - Orientation: -0.2402
   - Velocity: 8.8257 m/s
   - Acceleration: 1.9564 m/s²
   - Lanelet: 807.0
   - Relative to Ego: Position difference (y-axis mainly): 23.8671 m, moving in different directions. 
   - **Risk:** Negligible due to significant lateral distance and different paths.

3. **Obstacle 30297:**
   - Position: (-171.7124, 94.488)
   - Orientation: -2.0631
   - Velocity: 6.3434 m/s
   - Acceleration: -0.1701 m/s²
   - Lanelet: 1081.0
   - Relative to Ego: Position difference in y-axis: 13.3911 m, diverging velocities and movement vectors.
   - **Risk:** Medium Risk, adequate distances maintained.

4. **Obstacle 30299:**
   - Position: (-164.9916, 121.4069)
   - Orientation: -1.6246
   - Velocity: 6.3826 m/s
   - Acceleration: -0.0575 m/s²
   - Lanelet: 1083.0
   - Relative to Ego: Y-position difference approx. 13.5278 m and moving slightly outward.
   - **Risk:** Medium Risk with trajectory showing safety unless sudden changes occur.

5. **Obstacle 30300:**
   - Position: (-164.8025, 132.3353)
   - Orientation: -1.5629
   - Velocity: 4.1781 m/s
   - Acceleration: 1.37 m/s²
   - Lanelet: 1084.0
   - Relative to Ego: Distance around 24.4562 m, trajectory suggests moving away.
   - **Risk:** Low Risk, adequate separation, and diverging paths.

### Conclusion:
- None of the obstacles are directly on a collision path with Ego within the given timeframe or trajectory.
- Most maintain significant distances or diverging paths, reducing collision potential.
  
### Impacting Risk Scores:
- 30297 and 30299 display manageable risks due to moderate proximity and unsure reaction times but do not immediately threaten collision.
