At t=0.9s:
- Obstacle 30296 is moving towards the ego vehicle longitudinally and away laterally.  Longitudinal distance is decreasing but still relatively far at 18.86m.  Lateral distance is increasing. It poses a low risk currently.
- Obstacle 30297 is in the front-right and slowly moving towards the ego longitudinally (9.62m) and away laterally.  It is classified as a medium risk due to its proximity but the movements suggest it's not on a direct collision course.
- Obstacle 30299 is behind the ego and moving away longitudinally. It poses a negligible risk.
- Obstacle 30300 is behind and to the right and moving away longitudinally. Although moving closer laterally, it's still relatively far and poses a low risk currently.

There are no collision or extreme risk obstacles. Obstacle 30297 is the closest and requires monitoring due to its proximity and longitudinal motion towards the ego vehicle but isn't an immediate threat. No obstacle poses a high risk currently.
