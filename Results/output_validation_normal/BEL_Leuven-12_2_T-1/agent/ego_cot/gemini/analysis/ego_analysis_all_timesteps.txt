### Safety analysis for timestep 0.9s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

**- Obstacle ID: 30296**
- Distance Risk reason:  Located at approximately 18.86m front-left of the ego vehicle.  No immediate collision risk based on distance, but the closing longitudinal velocity warrants attention.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason:  While lateral movement suggests diverging paths, the negative longitudinal velocity indicates the obstacle is approaching the ego vehicle.  Further observation needed.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3

**- Obstacle ID: 30297**
- Distance Risk reason: Relatively close at 9.62m front-right, requiring attention.
- Distance safety score: 2
- Time Risk reason: While slightly moving towards the ego vehicle longitudinally, its lateral velocity suggests it's moving away. The small distances warrant continued monitoring.
- Time safety score: 2
- Overall Risk score: 2

**- Obstacle ID: 30299**
- Distance Risk reason:  Located 9.09m behind the ego vehicle.  No immediate risk.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason:  Moving away from the ego vehicle longitudinally. No time-based risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

**- Obstacle ID: 30300**
- Distance Risk reason: Located far behind (19.83m) and to the rear-right of the ego vehicle. No immediate risk based on distance.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Moving away longitudinally, posing no time-related risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5
