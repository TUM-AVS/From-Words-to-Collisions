### Obstacle-by-Obstacle Analysis

#### Obstacle 30296 (Front-left of ego car)
- **Adjusted Distance**: Longitudinal 18.86 m, Lateral 3.25 m  
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal -6.08 m/s (approaching), Lateral 8.82 m/s (moving away)  
- **Motion**: Driving toward ego longitudinally but moving away laterally to the left.  
- **TTC Longitudinal**: 18.86 / 6.08 ≈ 3.10 s (Medium Risk)  
- **TTC Lateral**: Not applicable (moving away)  
- **MDC**: Lateral distance is increasing (3.25 m), so MDC is not a concern.  
- **Overall Risk**: Medium Risk (3) due to longitudinal approach but safe lateral distance.

#### Obstacle 30297 (Front-right of ego car)
- **Adjusted Distance**: Longitudinal 9.62 m, Lateral -0.62 m  
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal -0.33 m/s (approaching), Lateral -1.81 m/s (moving away)  
- **Motion**: Driving toward ego longitudinally but moving away laterally to the right.  
- **TTC Longitudinal**: 9.62 / 0.33 ≈ 29.15 s (No Risk)  
- **TTC Lateral**: Not applicable (moving away)  
- **MDC**: Lateral distance is increasing (0.62 m), so MDC is not a concern.  
- **Overall Risk**: No Risk (5) due to minimal longitudinal approach and safe lateral distance.

#### Obstacle 30299 (Behind of ego car)
- **Adjusted Distance**: Longitudinal -9.09 m, Lateral 0.00 m  
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal -0.10 m/s (moving away), Lateral 0.95 m/s (moving away)  
- **Motion**: Moving away longitudinally and laterally.  
- **TTC Longitudinal**: Not applicable (moving away)  
- **TTC Lateral**: Not applicable (moving away)  
- **MDC**: Not applicable (moving away in both dimensions).  
- **Overall Risk**: No Risk (5) as the obstacle is moving away.

#### Obstacle 30300 (Rear-right of ego car)
- **Adjusted Distance**: Longitudinal -19.83 m, Lateral -1.46 m  
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal -2.32 m/s (moving away), Lateral 0.87 m/s (approaching)  
- **Motion**: Moving away longitudinally but approaching laterally from the right.  
- **TTC Longitudinal**: Not applicable (moving away)  
- **TTC Lateral**: 1.46 / 0.87 ≈ 1.68 s (Medium Risk)  
- **MDC**: Lateral distance is 1.46 m (Medium Risk).  
- **Overall Risk**: Medium Risk (3) due to lateral approach but safe longitudinal distance.

### Trajectory Analysis
- **Obstacle 30296**: Shows consistent longitudinal approach but increasing lateral distance, indicating a diagonal pass with no collision risk.  
- **Obstacle 30297**: Minimal longitudinal approach and increasing lateral distance, posing no risk.  
- **Obstacle 30299**: Consistently moving away in both dimensions.  
- **Obstacle 30300**: Moving away longitudinally but slowly approaching laterally, requiring monitoring but no immediate risk.

### Final Notes
- No obstacles pose a collision (0), extreme risk (1), or high risk (2).  
- Obstacles 30296 and 30300 have medium risk (3) due to longitudinal and lateral approaches, respectively, but with sufficient time/distance to react.  
- The ego vehicle should monitor Obstacle 30296 (longitudinal approach) and Obstacle 30300 (lateral approach) but no immediate action is required.
