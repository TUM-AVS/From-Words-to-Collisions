### Analysis

#### Obstacle 30296:
- **Latest Position**: Front-left, Longitudinal: 18.86m, Lateral: 3.25m
- **Trajectory**: Continuously closing longitudinally with increasing lateral distance over time.
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal: -6.08 m/s (closing), Lateral: 8.82 m/s (moving away).
- **Motion Description**: Driving toward ego longitudinally, moving away laterally to the left.

**TTC (longitudinal)** = 18.86m / 6.08m/s ≈ 3.10s
**MDC (longitudinal only, larger lateral dimension)**: Limited since lateral is increasing to a safe margin. However, if strictly longitudinal: ≈ 18.86m.

**Risk Assessment**: Medium risk, considering trajectory directions and velocity rates.

#### Obstacle 30297:
- **Latest Position**: Front-right, Longitudinal: 9.62m, Lateral: -0.62m
- **Trajectory**: Largely stable longitudinally with slight approach. Slight lateral approach noted but minimal.
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal: -0.33 m/s (closing), Lateral: -1.81 m/s (closing).
- **Motion Description**: Driving toward the ego vehicle longitudinally.

**TTC (lateral)** = |-0.62m| / 1.81m/s ≈ 0.34s
**MDC (accounting for both)**: Longitudinal stable, lateral closing closely.

**Risk Assessment**: Extreme risk, owing to rapid lateral closing at current position.

#### Obstacle 30299:
- **Latest Position**: Behind, Longitudinal: -9.09m, Lateral: 0.00m
- **Trajectory**: Generally stable or receding longitudinal; minimal lateral motion.
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal: -0.10 m/s (passively moving away), Lateral: 0.95 m/s.
- **Motion Description**: Moving away longitudinally, exact lateral alignment.

**TTC (longitudinal)** not applicable at low negative values (approaching receding).
**MDC**: Distance increases along both axes, minimal risk.

**Risk Assessment**: Negligible risk, given position and trajectory.

#### Obstacle 30300:
- **Latest Position**: Rear-right, Longitudinal: -19.83m, Lateral: -1.46m
- **Trajectory**: Increasing longitudinal distance, slight lateral increase.
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal: -2.32 m/s (moving away), Lateral: 0.87 m/s.
- **Motion Description**: Moving away longitudinally, toward laterally.

**TTC (lateral)** = |-1.46m| / 0.87m/s ≈ 1.68s
**MDC**: Based on trajectory, but risk reduced due to receding longitudinally.

**Risk Assessment**: Medium risk, with mild lateral closing trend but far longitudinal distance.

**Conclusion**: Obstacle 30297 poses the greatest immediate threat due to low TTC with rapidly closing lateral distance. Obstacle 30296 is a medium risk with a potentially converging trajectory but longer reaction time due to larger distances. Obstacle 30300 also poses a medium risk, while Obstacle 30299 is negligible in risk owing to its receding nature.
