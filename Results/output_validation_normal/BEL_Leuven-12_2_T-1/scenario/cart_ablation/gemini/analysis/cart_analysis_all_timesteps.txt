At t=0.9s, Ego is in lanelet 846.0 at (-166.691, 107.8791). Let's analyze the obstacles:

* **Obstacle 30296.0:** Located in lanelet 807.0 at (-166.6292, 84.012). While the x-coordinate is very close to Ego's, the y-coordinate reveals a significant separation.  Based on previous timestamps, this obstacle appears to be moving away from Ego, further reducing risk.  Risk assessment: Low.

* **Obstacle 30297.0:** Located in lanelet 1081.0 at (-171.7124, 94.488).  A considerable distance from Ego and no immediate risk based on current positions and trajectory. Risk assessment: Low.

* **Obstacle 30299.0:** Located in lanelet 1083.0 at (-164.9916, 121.4069). This obstacle is relatively close to Ego. Analyzing the trajectories from previous timestamps, the y-coordinate difference is decreasing, but not rapidly enough to be considered an extreme risk at this point. Risk assessment: Medium.

* **Obstacle 30300.0:** Located in lanelet 1084.0 at (-164.8025, 132.3353).  This obstacle is also somewhat near Ego but poses no imminent collision risk at this specific timestamp. Risk assessment: Medium.
