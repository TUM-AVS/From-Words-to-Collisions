At t=0.9s, Ego is in lanelet 846.0 at (-166.691, 107.8791)

Obstacle 30296.0 is in lanelet 807.0 at (-166.6292, 84.012). While the x-coordinates are very close, the y-coordinates are significantly different, indicating no immediate collision risk.  Trajectory analysis from previous timesteps shows this obstacle moving closer in the x-direction but maintaining a safe distance in the y-direction.

Obstacle 30297.0 is in lanelet 1081.0 at (-171.7124, 94.488). This obstacle is further away from the ego vehicle and doesn't present an immediate risk.

Obstacle 30299.0 is in lanelet 1083.0 at (-164.9916, 121.4069).  While the y-coordinate suggests some proximity, the x-coordinate difference suggests no immediate collision risk. Previous timesteps show this obstacle moving closer to the ego vehicle, but not at a rate suggesting imminent collision.

Obstacle 30300.0 is in lanelet 1084.0 at (-164.8025, 132.3353). This obstacle is relatively far from the ego vehicle and poses no immediate threat.
