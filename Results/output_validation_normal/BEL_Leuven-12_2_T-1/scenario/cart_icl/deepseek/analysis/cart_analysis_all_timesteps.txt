### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep (0.9 seconds):

### Obstacle Analysis:

#### Obstacle ID: 30296
- **Distance Risk reason**: Moving away from ego in X-direction (X-distance increasing from -171.9752 to -166.6292 over 9 timesteps). Y-distance decreasing but still significant (113.7661 vs 84.012). 
- **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
- **Time Risk reason**: High relative velocity (8.8257 vs ego's 6.4078) but diverging paths.
- **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
- **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low Risk)

#### Obstacle ID: 30297
- **Distance Risk reason**: Initially close in X-direction but moving away (-169.4682 to -171.7124). Y-distance decreasing (113.7661 vs 94.488).
- **Distance safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk)
- **Time Risk reason**: Similar velocity (6.3434 vs 6.4078) but trajectory diverging.
- **Time safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk)
- **Overall Risk score**: 3 (Medium Risk)

#### Obstacle ID: 30299
- **Distance Risk reason**: Moving towards ego in Y-direction (126.3769 to 121.4069) but still significant distance.
- **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
- **Time Risk reason**: Similar velocity (6.3826 vs 6.4078) with stable distance.
- **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
- **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low Risk)

#### Obstacle ID: 30300
- **Distance Risk reason**: Moving away in Y-direction (135.0923 to 132.3353). Large initial distance.
- **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- **Time Risk reason**: Lower velocity (4.1781 vs 6.4078) and diverging.
- **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- **Overall Risk score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. No obstacles are in the same lanelet as ego at 0.9s (lanelet 846).
2. All obstacles are either moving away or maintaining safe distances.
3. No sudden acceleration/deceleration patterns indicating imminent collision.
4. Closest obstacle (30297) has diverging trajectory with medium risk.
5. No collision or extreme risk detected in any timestep.
