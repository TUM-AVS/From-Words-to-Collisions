### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 30296.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is laterally separated and moving away from ego.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Relative velocity suggests no immediate risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 30297.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is laterally separated and slightly behind the ego vehicle.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Relative velocity is low.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- Obstacle ID: 30299.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is behind the ego vehicle and in a different lanelet.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Relative velocity suggests no immediate risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 30300.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is behind the ego vehicle and in a different lanelet.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Relative velocity suggests no immediate risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
No obstacles pose an immediate collision risk at the most recent timestep. All obstacles are either laterally separated, in different lanelets or moving away from the ego vehicle. No obstacle has a risk score of 0 or 1. Therefore, it is not a collision scenario.
