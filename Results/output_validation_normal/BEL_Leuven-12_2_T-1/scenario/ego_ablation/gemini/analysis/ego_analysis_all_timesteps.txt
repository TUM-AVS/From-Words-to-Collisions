Obstacle 30296 is moving towards the ego vehicle longitudinally, but laterally it is moving away from the ego vehicle to the left.  At 0.9 seconds, the longitudinal distance is 18.86m and the lateral distance is 3.25m. Given the current relative velocity and acceleration, a collision is not imminent in the next timestep.

Obstacle 30297 is slowly approaching the ego vehicle longitudinally while moving away laterally to the right. At 0.9 seconds, the longitudinal distance is 9.62m and the lateral distance is -0.62m. While the longitudinal distance is decreasing, the lateral movement suggests a low risk of collision.

Obstacles 30299 and 30300 are behind the ego vehicle and moving away, presenting no immediate risk.

Therefore, there are no obstacles posing an immediate collision risk in the next timestep.
