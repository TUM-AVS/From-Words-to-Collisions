At t=0.9s:
- Obstacle 30296 (Front-Left):  Longitudinal distance is decreasing, but still relatively far at 18.86m. Lateral distance is increasing, moving away laterally.  Not an immediate risk.
- Obstacle 30297 (Front-Right):  Longitudinal distance is close at 9.62m and slightly decreasing. Lateral distance is fairly small and decreasing. This obstacle warrants attention, although not an immediate collision risk.
- Obstacle 30299 (Behind): Longitudinal distance is relatively stable and safe. No immediate risk.
- Obstacle 30300 (Rear-Right):  Moving away longitudinally.  Lateral distance is small and decreasing, but since it's behind, poses less of a risk.  Not an immediate risk.

Based on the last timestep (0.9 seconds), none of the obstacles pose an immediate collision risk. Obstacle 30297 requires monitoring due to its proximity and lateral movement. However, there's no indication of a collision within the next timestep.
