### Safety analysis for timestep 0.9 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

There are no adjusted distances provided in the context.  Therefore, I will use the provided real distances (DTClong, DTClat) and relative velocities (Vrel_long, Vrel_lat) to estimate TTC and perform a qualitative risk assessment.  **It is crucial to understand that without adjusted distances and vehicle dimensions, this assessment will be less precise.**  A true TTC calculation requires accounting for vehicle size and shape. I will assume for now the vehicle sizes are negligible for the following calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 30296**
- Distance Risk reason:  Located at DTClong = 18.86m and DTClat = 18.86m in the Front-left. This is a relatively safe distance at this timestep.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Approaching longitudinally (Vrel_long = -6.08 m/s) and laterally (Vrel_lat = 8.82 m/s). Rough TTClong estimation is 18.86m / 6.08 m/s ≈ 3.1 seconds. The lateral movement suggests it is likely passing in front and moving away laterally.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3

- **Obstacle ID: 30297**
- Distance Risk reason: Located at DTClong = 9.62m and DTClat = 9.62m Front-right.  This is moderately close.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason:  Slightly approaching longitudinally (Vrel_long = -0.33 m/s) and moving away laterally (Vrel_lat = -1.81 m/s). Rough TTClong estimation is 9.62 / 0.33 ≈ 29 seconds, if the longitudinal velocity remains constant. The lateral movement indicates reducing risk.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4


- **Obstacle ID: 30299**
- Distance Risk reason: Located behind the ego vehicle at DTClong = -9.09m and DTClat = -9.09m. Poses no immediate risk from its current position.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Moving slightly away longitudinally (Vrel_long = -0.10 m/s) and laterally (Vrel_lat = 0.95 m/s) and moving away so it poses no immediate risk from its velocity
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5


- **Obstacle ID: 30300**
- Distance Risk reason: Located behind and to the right of the ego vehicle at DTClong = -19.83m and DTClat = -19.83m. This distance poses no immediate risk.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Moving away longitudinally (Vrel_long = -2.32 m/s) and slightly towards the ego vehicle laterally (Vrel_lat = 0.87 m/s). Since it is behind the ego vehicle the lateral movement does not pose a critical risk
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5
