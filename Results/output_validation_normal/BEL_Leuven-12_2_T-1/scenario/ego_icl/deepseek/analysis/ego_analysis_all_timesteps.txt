Let me analyze each obstacle at the most recent timestep (0.9 seconds) and assess collision risks:

1. Obstacle 30296 (Front-left):
- Adjusted distances: longitudinal 18.86m, lateral 3.25m
- Relative velocity: longitudinal -6.08 m/s (approaching), lateral 8.82 m/s (moving away)
- Motion: Moving toward ego longitudinally but away laterally
- MDC: Lateral distance is increasing (3.25m), so primary risk is longitudinal
- TTC (longitudinal): 18.86/6.08 = 3.10 seconds → Medium Risk (3)
- Overall Risk: Medium (3)

2. Obstacle 30297 (Front-right):
- Adjusted distances: longitudinal 9.62m, lateral -0.62m
- Relative velocity: longitudinal -0.33 m/s (slightly approaching), lateral -1.81 m/s (moving away)
- Motion: Very slowly approaching longitudinally, moving away laterally
- MDC: Lateral distance increasing (0.62m)
- TTC (longitudinal): 9.62/0.33 = 29.15 seconds → No Risk (5)
- Overall Risk: No Risk (5)

3. Obstacle 30299 (Behind):
- Adjusted distances: longitudinal -9.09m, lateral 0.00m
- Relative velocity: longitudinal -0.10 m/s (moving away), lateral 0.95 m/s
- Motion: Moving away longitudinally, exact lateral alignment
- MDC: Longitudinal distance increasing (9.09m)
- TTC: Not applicable (moving away) → No Risk (5)
- Overall Risk: No Risk (5)

4. Obstacle 30300 (Rear-right):
- Adjusted distances: longitudinal -19.83m, lateral -1.46m
- Relative velocity: longitudinal -2.32 m/s (moving away), lateral 0.87 m/s (approaching)
- Motion: Moving away longitudinally, slowly approaching laterally
- MDC: Lateral distance (1.46m) with approaching velocity
- TTC (lateral): 1.46/0.87 = 1.68 seconds → Medium Risk (3)
- Overall Risk: Medium (3)

Trajectory Analysis:
- Obstacle 30296 shows the most concerning trajectory with rapidly decreasing longitudinal distance (from 21.11m at 0.5s to 18.86m at 0.9s)
- However, at current distances (>18m) and TTC (>3s), it doesn't reach extreme risk
- All other obstacles are either moving away or at safe distances
