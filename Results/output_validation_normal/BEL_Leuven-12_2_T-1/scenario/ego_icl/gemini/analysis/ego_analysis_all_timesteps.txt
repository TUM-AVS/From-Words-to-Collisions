* **Obstacle 30296 (Front-Left):** This obstacle has been moving closer to the ego vehicle both longitudinally and laterally over the observed timesteps.  At the last timestep (0.9s), it is 18.86m ahead and 3.25m to the left. Although the lateral distance is increasing, the longitudinal distance is rapidly decreasing, suggesting a potential future collision risk if the trend continues. Without adjusted distances and relative velocity/acceleration in the last time step, we can't definitively determine TTC or MDC for a precise risk score. However, based on the raw distance and the movement trend, this warrants at least a Medium risk.
* **Obstacle 30297 (Front-Right):** This obstacle is nearly stationary relative to the ego vehicle longitudinally (9.62m at 0.9s) but slowly moving away from ego laterally. The distance change trends across timestamps show little concern for collision risk at this point, so this is categorized as Low risk if adjusted distance > 5.0 and No risk if < 5.0.
* **Obstacle 30299 (Behind):** The lateral position of this obstacle remains 0.00m.  It is driving away from the ego vehicle, as seen through the increase in longitudinal distance. This obstacle presents No Risk as it is moving away from the ego vehicle and is behind it.
* **Obstacle 30300 (Rear-Right):** The longitudinal distance of this obstacle suggests No Risk. The lateral distance is decreasing (obstacle moving towards the ego vehicle laterally from the right), but it remains quite far behind and is moving away longitudinally. This would be deemed a No Risk unless the adjusted lateral distance is below 5.0m, which would then place it at Low Risk.


**Conclusion:** Based on the provided data and lacking the final adjusted distances and velocities for definitive calculations, there is no indication of a collision at the last timestep. However, obstacle 30296 warrants close monitoring due to the rapidly decreasing longitudinal distance. To provide a final collision assessment, the adjusted distances and relative velocity/acceleration at the most recent time step (0.9s) are crucial for accurate MDC and TTC calculations.

  "Justification": "No obstacle presents an immediate collision risk at the last timestep (0.9s) based on current data. However, Obstacle 30296 needs continuous monitoring due to decreasing longitudinal distance. A definitive assessment requires adjusted distances and relative velocities at the most recent timestep."
