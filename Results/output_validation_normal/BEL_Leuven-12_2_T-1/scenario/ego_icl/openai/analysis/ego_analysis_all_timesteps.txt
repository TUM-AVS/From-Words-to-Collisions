Here's the detailed analysis of obstacles at the most recent timestep (0.9 seconds), focusing on trajectory and risk assessment:

### Obstacle 30296:
- **Position and Motion**: The obstacle is now in the Front-left. 
- **Adjusted Distances**: Longitudinal: 18.86 m, Lateral: 3.25 m.
- **Trajectories**: The obstacle is closing longitudinally and moving further laterally to the left, away from ego.
- **Velocities**: Longitudinal velocity: -6.08 m/s, indicating rapid approach. Lateral velocity: 8.82 m/s, moving away laterally.
- **TTC Calculation (Longitudinal)**: TTC = 18.86 m / 6.08 m/s = 3.10 seconds.
- **MDC**: Given the lateral movement is away from the ego, MDC primarily considers the longitudinal direction, which is 18.86 m.
- **Risk Assessment**: Since its longitudinal trajectory is rapidly closing and it is within 3.10 seconds to reach the ego, this indicates a **Medium Risk (3)** due to significant lateral separation and increasing distance.

### Obstacle 30297:
- **Position and Motion**: The obstacle is still in the Front-right.
- **Adjusted Distances**: Longitudinal: 9.62 m, Lateral: -0.62 m.
- **Trajectories**: The obstacle is slightly closing longitudinally. It is already farther in both directions.
- **Velocities**: Longitudinal: -0.33 m/s, Lateral: -1.81 m/s.
- **TTC Calculation (Longitudinal)**: TTC = 9.62 m / 0.33 m/s = 29.15 seconds.
- **MDC**: Since the obstacle is gradually moving further both longitudinally and laterally, MDC considers a stable distancing.
- **Risk Assessment**: Given the longer TTC and lateral distancing coupled with slowing trajectory towards ego, it shows **Low Risk (4)**.

### Obstacle 30299:
- **Position and Motion**: The obstacle is Behind with a longitudinal distance of -9.09 m.
- **Adjusted Distances**: Longitudinal: behind, Lateral: 0.00 m.
- **Trajectories**: It is moving away with lateral distancing slightly increasing.
- **Velocities**: Longitudinal: -0.10 m/s, Lateral: 0.95 m/s.
- **TTC Calculation**: Not applicable due to negative longitudinal.
- **MDC**: Primarily lateral separation of 9.09 m, increasing.
- **Risk Assessment**: The obstacle is moving away with no immediate convergence, **No Risk (5)**.

### Obstacle 30300:
- **Position and Motion**: In the Rear-right, moving away, laterally approaching but no immediate threat due to longitudinal trajectory.
- **Adjusted Distances**: Longitudinal: -19.83 m, Lateral: -1.46 m.
- **Trajectories**: Rapidly moving away longitudinally.
- **Velocities**: Longitudinal: -2.32 m/s, Lateral: 0.87 m/s.
- **TTC Calculation**: Not applicable due to negative longitudinal.
- **MDC**: Considers lateral distancing for trajectory projection, but moving away longitudinally.
- **Risk Assessment**: Continued distancing indicates **No Risk (5)**.

### Conclusion:
Analyzing all data, none of the obstacles presents an immediate collision threat. While Obstacle 30296's significant surprisingly longitudinal approach raises a medium risk, it is still largely moving away laterally. Hence, there is no scenario that amounts to a collision or extreme risk scenario in this timestep.
