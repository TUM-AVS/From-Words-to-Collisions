Obstacle 30242 is consistently close to the ego vehicle and its lateral position suggests it is in an adjacent lane.  The distance between the two vehicles appears to be decreasing over the provided timesteps. Although the ego vehicle is braking, Obstacle 30242 is accelerating. While a collision doesn't appear imminent within the next second, the closing distance and differing accelerations warrant a high-risk assessment.

Obstacles 30240 and 30241 are further away and their trajectories do not present an immediate concern.
