Here's a breakdown of the collision analysis at t=0.9s:

**Ego Vehicle State (t=0.9s):**
* Position: (-378.7881, 156.7319)
* Orientation: 2.9520 radians
* Velocity: 9.3859 (units assumed to be m/s)
* Acceleration: -0.6277 (units assumed to be m/s^2)
* Lanelet: 1032

**Obstacle Analysis (t=0.9s):**

* **Obstacle 30240:**
    * Position: (-394.0765, 163.2812)
    * Distance to Ego: sqrt((-394.0765 + 378.7881)^2 + (163.2812 - 156.7319)^2) ≈ 15.68 meters
    * Velocity: 7.4867 m/s
    * Relative Velocity (approximation, requires angle information):  Difficult to estimate accurately without relative angle between ego and obstacle velocities. However, based on position and lanelet information, it's likely not directly heading towards the ego vehicle.
    * TTC (Longitudinal/Lateral):  Not calculable precisely without more information. However, given the lateral distance and that they are in different lanelets, longitudinal TTC is not a primary concern.
    * Risk Assessment:  Low Risk (4). Obstacle is relatively far and not on a direct collision course in the immediate future.

* **Obstacle 30241:**
    * Position: (-380.7262, 160.6706)
    * Distance to Ego: sqrt((-380.7262 + 378.7881)^2 + (160.6706 - 156.7319)^2) ≈ 4.13 meters
    * Velocity: 6.8662 m/s
    * Relative Velocity: Requires further analysis of angles.  The close proximity raises concern, so further analysis on their relative paths is necessary.
    * TTC: Potentially short, needs more information. The small distance warrants close monitoring.
    * Risk Assessment: Medium Risk (3).  Close proximity, but more information is needed to determine if the trajectories will intersect.

* **Obstacle 30242:**
    * Position: (-368.6481, 158.2047)
    * Distance to Ego: sqrt((-368.6481 + 378.7881)^2 + (158.2047 - 156.7319)^2) ≈ 10.15 meters
    * Velocity: 5.5019 m/s
    * Relative Velocity:  Requires further analysis of angles, but given the position and lanelets,  this obstacle could be moving towards the ego vehicle's lane or path. 
    * TTC: Cannot be determined precisely without relative velocity information, but requires attention.
    * Risk Assessment: Low Risk (4).  The obstacle is approaching from behind but not extremely close, so it is unlikely to cause collision in the immediate future.
