At t=0.9s, the ego vehicle is in lanelet 1032. Let's analyze the obstacles:

* **Obstacle 30240:** Located in lanelet 242, far from the ego vehicle with a significant lateral separation and moving in a roughly parallel direction.  Poses no immediate threat. Risk: **Negligible (5)**

* **Obstacle 30241:**  Located in lanelet 1033, laterally separated from the ego vehicle (in lanelet 1032).  While the lateral distance is not huge, there's no indication of immediate danger. Risk: **Low (4)**

* **Obstacle 30242:** Located in lanelet 1029. This obstacle is close to the ego vehicle and its lane. We need to calculate TTC and MDC to determine the risk.

    * Approximate relative positions at t=0.9s:
        * Ego: (-378.7881, 156.7319)
        * Obstacle 30242: (-368.6481, 158.2047)
    * Approximate relative velocity:
        * Ego: (9.3859 * cos(2.952), 9.3859 * sin(2.952)) ≈ (-9.37, 0.48)
        * Obstacle 30242: (5.5019 * cos(2.9011), 5.5019 * sin(2.9011)) ≈ (-5.49, 0.28)
        * Relative Velocity ≈ (3.88, 0.20)
    * Relative position ≈ (10.14, 1.47)

    Considering that the relative velocity in x direction is positive(moving away from each other), meaning they are diverging, while y direction has only a small relative velocity and relatively small displacement suggests that the obstacle and Ego might be moving in the same general direction.  Given the ego vehicle's deceleration and the obstacle's slight acceleration, a collision is unlikely unless the ego vehicle makes a sudden lane change towards obstacle 30242. Risk: **Medium (3)**
