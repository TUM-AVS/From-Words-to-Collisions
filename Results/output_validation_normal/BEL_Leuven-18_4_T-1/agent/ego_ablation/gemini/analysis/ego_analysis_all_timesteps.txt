At t=0.9s, Obstacle 30241 is at the same longitudinal distance as the ego vehicle, with a small lateral distance of -1.89m. Although it is moving away laterally, the small lateral distance and the longitudinal velocity towards the ego (-2.52 m/s) present a potential risk.  The other obstacles are not a concern as they are moving away from the ego vehicle and are at safe distances both longitudinally and laterally.
