### Safety analysis for timestep 0.9s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID:** 30240
- **Distance Risk reason:** Obstacle is located at 11.74m longitudinally and 11.74m laterally in the front-right of the ego vehicle.  This indicates a safe distance.
- **Distance safety score:** 5
- **Time Risk reason:**  The relative velocity suggests the obstacle is moving towards the ego vehicle longitudinally but away laterally, further reducing risk.  Without specific velocity values, precise TTC cannot be calculated, but given the distances and moderate relative velocities, it is likely high.
- **Time safety score:** 4
- **Overall Risk score:** 4

- **Obstacle ID:** 30241
- **Distance Risk reason:**  Obstacle is located at 0.0m longitudinally and 0.0m laterally to the right of the ego vehicle. This indicates a potential collision or extremely close proximity.
- **Distance safety score:** 1
- **Time Risk reason:**  The relative velocity suggests the obstacle is moving away from the ego vehicle laterally. However, the zero distance longitudinally poses a serious risk.  A precise TTC cannot be calculated without velocity magnitudes, but the near-zero distance raises significant concern.
- **Time safety score:** 1
- **Overall Risk score:** 1


- **Obstacle ID:** 30242
- **Distance Risk reason:** Obstacle is 5.17m behind and 5.17m to the right of the ego vehicle, indicating a safe distance.
- **Distance safety score:** 5
- **Time Risk reason:** The obstacle is moving away from the ego vehicle both longitudinally and laterally. This greatly reduces collision risk, indicating a high TTC.
- **Time safety score:** 5
- **Overall Risk score:** 5
