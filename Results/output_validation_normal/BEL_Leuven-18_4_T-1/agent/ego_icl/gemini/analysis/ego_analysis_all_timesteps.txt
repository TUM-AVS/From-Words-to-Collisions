* **Obstacle 30240 (Front-Right):**

    * Trajectory: This obstacle has been consistently in the front-right of the ego vehicle, with both longitudinal and lateral distances decreasing over the observed time steps, although the rate of lateral approach is slowing.
    * At t=0.9s:
        * Longitudinal distance: 11.74m
        * Lateral distance: -1.94m
        * Longitudinal relative velocity: -1.90 m/s (approaching)
        * Lateral relative velocity: -0.03 m/s (slightly diverging)

    * TTC (longitudinal): 11.74m / 1.90m/s ≈ 6.2s
    * MDC: Since this obstacle is approaching diagonally, we prioritize the smaller distance, which is the lateral distance of 1.94m. This is converging.

    * Risk Assessment: Based on MDC and TTC values alone, the risk level would be Low (4). However, the trend is for this gap between the vehicles to close, which could become a concern in the future.

* **Obstacle 30241 (Right):**

    * Trajectory: This obstacle has moved from the front-right to be directly to the right of the ego vehicle. Its longitudinal velocity has been decreasing as it has come alongside.
    * At t=0.9s:
        * Longitudinal distance: 0.00m 
        * Lateral distance: -1.89m
        * Longitudinal relative velocity: -2.52 m/s (moving away)
        * Lateral relative velocity: -0.01 m/s (slightly diverging)

    * TTC (lateral): 1.89m / 0.01m/s ≈ 189s (not a meaningful metric given the near-zero velocity and the lateral distance that will continue to remain steady or increase).
    * MDC: Given the obstacle is directly to the right, we prioritize the lateral distance of 1.89m

    * Risk Assessment: With the obstacle maintaining or increasing its lateral distance, the primary risk metric is MDC, which indicates a Medium Risk (3) due to the close proximity. However, the consistent negative longitudinal velocity and the slight lateral divergence shows this obstacle poses less risk.

* **Obstacle 30242 (Rear-Right):**

    * Trajectory: This obstacle is behind and to the right of the ego vehicle, and consistently moving further away in both dimensions.
    * At t=0.9s:
        * Longitudinal distance: -5.17m
        * Lateral distance: -1.75m
        * Longitudinal relative velocity: -3.89 m/s (moving away)
        * Lateral relative velocity: -0.28 m/s (moving away)

    * TTC: Not applicable as the obstacle is moving away.
    * MDC: Not applicable as the obstacle is moving away.

    * Risk Assessment: Negligible Risk (5). The obstacle is moving away from the ego vehicle.
