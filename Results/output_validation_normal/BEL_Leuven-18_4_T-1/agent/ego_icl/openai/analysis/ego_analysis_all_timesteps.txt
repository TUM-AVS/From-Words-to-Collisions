### Obstacle Analysis

**Obstacle 30240:**
- **Trajectory**: At 0.9 seconds, Obstacle 30240 is located to the front-right of the ego vehicle with adjusted distances of approximately 11.74 m (longitudinal) and -1.94 m (lateral). This indicates the obstacle is mainly in the front region.
- **Relative Velocity**: The relative longitudinal velocity is -1.90 m/s, indicating that the obstacle is gradually approaching the ego vehicle, albeit quite slowly. The lateral velocity of -0.03 m/s suggests the object is maintaining its lateral position.
- **TTC Calculation**: Using the longitudinal relative velocity, TTC = 11.74 m / 1.90 m/s â‰ˆ 6.18 seconds, which suggests there is negligible immediate risk.
- **MDC Calculation**: Longitudinal and lateral positions do not imply an extremely close pass imminently; since the lateral distance is significant and the closing speed is not rapid, MDC estimation suggests low risk.
- **Risk Assessment**: Based on the large distances and relatively distant TTC, the risk is negligible.

**Obstacle 30241:**
- **Trajectory**: At 0.9 seconds, Obstacle 30241, located right beside the ego vehicle, shows adjusted distances as 0.00 m (longitudinal) and -1.89 m (lateral). It is driving toward the ego car laterally.
- **Relative Velocity**: The longitudinal velocity is -2.52 m/s, indicating slight lateral movement toward the ego vehicle. The lateral velocity is essentially 0 m/s, showing a constant lateral alignment.
- **TTC Calculation**: On the lateral dimension, with the relative motion nearly static or divergent, lateral TTC cannot be accurately applied.
- **MDC Calculation**: The lateral distance of 1.89 m with no rapid lateral velocity suggests the MDC is above 1.0 m.
- **Risk Assessment**: Despite close proximity laterally, the lack of aggressive lateral closing velocity results in a medium risk due to proximity and speed.

**Obstacle 30242:**
- **Trajectory**: Positioned rear-right of the ego vehicle at 0.9 seconds, with distances of -5.17 m (longitudinal) and -1.75 m (lateral). It is retreating from the ego vehicle.
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal velocity is -3.89 m/s, indicating it is retreating from the ego vehicle. The lateral velocity of -0.28 m/s confirms lateral retreat.
- **TTC and MDC Calculation**: Since it is moving away, there are no imminent collision parameters to consider. Negative relative velocities confirm divergence.
- **Risk Assessment**: No real risk to the ego vehicle due to divergence; the paths are clearly separating.

### Final Risk Summary

```json
{
    "CollisionObstacle": null,
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "30241",
        "OverallRiskScore": "3"
    },
    "HighRiskObstacle": null
}
```

**Note**: None of the obstacles are in a collision course. The obstacles primarily exhibit medium to negligible risk conditions due to their trajectories and relative velocities. Obstacle 30241 presents medium risk due to lateral proximity but not high as it is not rapidly closing.
