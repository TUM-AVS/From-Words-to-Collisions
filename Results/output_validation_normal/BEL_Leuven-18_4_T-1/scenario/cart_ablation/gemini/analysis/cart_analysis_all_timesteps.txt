At t=0.9s, Ego is in lanelet 1032.

Obstacle 30240 is in lanelet 242 and poses no immediate risk due to the large lateral distance.

Obstacle 30241 is in lanelet 1033. While the lateral distance is not insignificant, the longitudinal distance is sufficient, and the trajectories don't indicate an immediate collision risk.

Obstacle 30242 is in lanelet 1029 and is the closest obstacle to the ego vehicle.  The longitudinal distance is decreasing, but not drastically. The lateral distance is also small. Given the ego's deceleration and obstacle 30242's slight acceleration, this situation needs to be monitored closely.  However, at this moment it doesn't pose an *extreme* risk.
