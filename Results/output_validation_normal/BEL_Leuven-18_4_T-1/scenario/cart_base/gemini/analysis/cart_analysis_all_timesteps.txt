At t=0.9s, Ego is in lanelet 1032.

Obstacle 30240 is in lanelet 242 and poses no immediate risk due to the large distance.

Obstacle 30241 is in lanelet 1033. While the distance is greater than at previous timesteps, the continuous approach and predicted paths could warrant attention.  However, it does not present an *extreme* risk at this moment.

Obstacle 30242 is in lanelet 1029 and is the closest.  It has been consistently approaching the Ego vehicle and the distance is now quite small. This represents a high risk, potentially escalating to extreme risk very soon. However, based purely on the 0.9s data point and the lack of information about lanelet geometry and widths, it's difficult to definitively categorize it as *extreme* risk *at this instant*.

        "Reasoning": "No obstacle presents an immediate collision risk at t=0.9s. Obstacle 30242 poses a high risk due to its proximity and should be monitored closely."
