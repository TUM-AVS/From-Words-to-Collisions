### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep:

### Obstacle Analysis:
1. **Obstacle ID: 30240.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is far from the ego vehicle (~15.3m away) and has been consistently moving away over the past timesteps. It is in a different lanelet (242.0) and not on a collision path.
   - **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: The relative velocity is low (ego is decelerating, obstacle is moving slowly away). No convergence in trajectories observed.
   - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)

2. **Obstacle ID: 30241.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is ~2.9m away from the ego vehicle and in a different lanelet (1033.0). The distance has been increasing slightly over time.
   - **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: The relative velocity is moderate (ego is decelerating, obstacle is accelerating slightly). Trajectories are not converging.
   - **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low Risk)

3. **Obstacle ID: 30242.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is ~1.2m away from the ego vehicle and in a nearby lanelet (1029.0). The distance has been decreasing slightly over time.
   - **Distance safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: The relative velocity is moderate (ego is decelerating, obstacle is accelerating). Trajectories are not directly converging but proximity is a concern.
   - **Time safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 3 (Medium Risk)

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. No obstacles are on a direct collision path with the ego vehicle.
2. Obstacle 30242.0 is the closest but still at a safe distance with no immediate risk of collision.
3. All obstacles are either moving away or maintaining a safe distance.
4. The ego vehicle is decelerating, which further reduces collision risk.
