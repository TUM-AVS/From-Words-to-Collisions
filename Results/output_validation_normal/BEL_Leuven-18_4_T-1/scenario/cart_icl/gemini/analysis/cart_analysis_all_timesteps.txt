### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 30236.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is far from ego vehicle and moving slightly further away.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason:  Relative velocities and trajectories suggest no immediate risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 30237.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is far from ego vehicle.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Relative velocities and trajectories suggest no immediate risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 30238.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is moderately far from ego vehicle.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Relative velocities and trajectories suggest no immediate risk.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- Obstacle ID: 30239.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is moderately far from ego vehicle.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Relative velocities and trajectories suggest no immediate risk.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- Obstacle ID: 30240.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is somewhat close to ego vehicle, but safe lateral distance.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason:  Relative velocities and trajectories suggest no immediate risk, but monitoring needed.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3

- Obstacle ID: 30241.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is close but in a different lanelet.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason:  Relative velocities and trajectories suggest no immediate risk.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- Obstacle ID: 30242.0
- Distance Risk reason:  Obstacle is very close and potentially in the same lane as ego vehicle or merging. Requires attention.
- Distance safety score: 2
- Time Risk reason: Relative velocities and accelerations suggest rapidly decreasing distance; potential for lane conflict. Requires close monitoring.
- Time safety score: 2
- Overall Risk score: 2


### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
The ego vehicle is changing lanelets, and obstacle 30242 is very close and possibly merging into the same lane. While not an immediate collision, the situation requires close attention due to proximity, lane change dynamics, and relative speed differences. No other obstacles present an immediate risk.

### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
  "CollisionObstacles": null,
  "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null,
  "ScenarioAnalysis": {
    "IsCollisionScenario": false,
    "Reasoning": "No obstacle has a risk score of 0, indicating no collision. Obstacle 30242 has a risk score of 2, requiring attention due to proximity and potential lane conflict during merging, but not an immediate collision."
  }
