### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: 

Upon examination of the trajectory data from the last 10 timesteps, we assess the position and motion of the ego vehicle and each obstacle in relation to potential collision risks.

### Obstacle Analysis:

1. **Obstacle ID: 30236**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Positioned in lanelet 242. Although the vehicle has a relatively steady trajectory and remains at a safe distance longitudinally and laterally, making the risk negligible.
   - **Distance safety score**: 5
   - **Time Risk reason**: Consistently maintains velocity with slight fluctuations; overall distance to the ego remains safe.
   - **Time safety score**: 5
   - **Overall Risk score**: 5

2. **Obstacle ID: 30237**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Positioned in lanelet 242, situated further along the path and not in direct potential contact with the ego’s path.
   - **Distance safety score**: 5
   - **Time Risk reason**: Relative velocities and consistent speed reductions indicate no immediate threat.
   - **Time safety score**: 5
   - **Overall Risk score**: 5

3. **Obstacle ID: 30238**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Maintained position in lanelet 242. Safe for longitudinal and lateral distances as paths do not converge.
   - **Distance safety score**: 5
   - **Time Risk reason**: Positive acceleration at moments continues keeping the obstacle out of the collision course.
   - **Time safety score**: 5
   - **Overall Risk score**: 5

4. **Obstacle ID: 30239**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Present in lanelet 241, not aligned with the ego vehicle’s current trajectory or lanelet position.
   - **Distance safety score**: 5
   - **Time Risk reason**: Moving in a different flow pattern and slows over time; no significant convergence detected.
   - **Time safety score**: 5
   - **Overall Risk score**: 5

5. **Obstacle ID: 30240**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Positioned in lanelet 242 without a path that intersects or gets extremely close to the ego vehicle’s path.
   - **Distance safety score**: 5
   - **Time Risk reason**: Consistent velocity patterns; paths do not approach with impending collision risk.
   - **Time safety score**: 5
   - **Overall Risk score**: 5

6. **Obstacle ID: 30241**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Lanelet 1033, paths diverging; keeps safe lateral and longitudinal separation.
   - **Distance safety score**: 5
   - **Time Risk reason**: Safely maintaining speeds that prevent encroaching into ego's path.
   - **Time safety score**: 5
   - **Overall Risk score**: 5

7. **Obstacle ID: 30242**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Positioned in lanelet 1029, close but with current trajectory and acceleration, the lane coordination remains safe.
   - **Distance safety score**: 4
   - **Time Risk reason**: Relatively low speed and increasing acceleration trend imply safe time margin for maneuvers; no dangerous proximity in future trajectory.
   - **Time safety score**: 4
   - **Overall Risk score**: 4

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
By analyzing the trajectory and relative positions over the 10-timestep snapshot, all obstacles are shown to maintain a safe distance from the ego vehicle. Even with accelerations and changes in velocity, no immediate or growing collision risk is calculated. No potential collision risk is immediate. Hence, this is not a collision scenario.
