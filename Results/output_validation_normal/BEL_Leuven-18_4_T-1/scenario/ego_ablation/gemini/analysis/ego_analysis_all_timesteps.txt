Obstacle 30241 is the most concerning obstacle as it is positioned to the right of the ego vehicle with a lateral distance of -1.89 meters, indicating proximity. Although it's moving away laterally, its longitudinal velocity suggests it is moving in parallel but slightly towards the ego vehicle, which might create risk if any sudden maneuvers occur.

Obstacle 30240, while approaching the ego longitudinally, maintains a safe lateral and longitudinal distance and poses no immediate threat. Obstacle 30242 is moving away from the ego vehicle and hence presents no risk of collision.
