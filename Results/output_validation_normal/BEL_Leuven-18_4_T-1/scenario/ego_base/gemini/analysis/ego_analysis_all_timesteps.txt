At t=0.9s, Obstacle 30241 is at the right of the ego vehicle with a longitudinal distance of 0.0m and a lateral distance of -1.89m. It has a relative longitudinal velocity of -2.52 m/s, meaning it's moving towards the ego car, and a small lateral velocity of -0.01 m/s indicating it is slightly moving away from the ego vehicle laterally.  Although obstacle 30241 is very close laterally, it does not represent an immediate collision risk in the next timestep given the current velocities and the fact that there is still almost 2 meters of lateral separation. The other obstacles are not a collision risk.

**Risk Levels and Definitions:**
<Collision (Score: 0)>: Actual collision has occurred or is unavoidable within the next timestep.
<Extreme Risk (Score: 1)>: Immediate collision or very high likelihood of impact. Urgent action is required.
<High Risk (Score: 2)>: Close to collision or highly probable collision path. Needs prompt attention and quick manoeuvring.
<Medium Risk (Score: 3)>: Moderate collision risk but manageable with timely reactions and proper strategies.
<Low Risk (Score: 4)>: Minimal collision risk. The situation is controllable with sufficient time to react.
<Negligible Risk (Score: 5)>: No significant collision risk. Obstacles are either moving away or far enough not to interfere.
