### Safety analysis for timestep 0.9 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID:** 30240
- **Distance Risk reason:**  Obstacle is located at 11.74m longitudinally and 11.74m laterally (front-right) relative to the ego vehicle. This distance is significant, posing no immediate threat.
- **Distance safety score:** 5
- **Time Risk reason:** While the obstacle is moving towards the ego vehicle longitudinally (-1.90 m/s), the lateral movement is slightly away (-0.03 m/s). The substantial distance suggests ample time to react.  A precise TTC calculation isn't possible without knowing the ego vehicle's motion, but given the presented data, the risk appears low.
- **Time safety score:** 4
- **Overall Risk score:** 4


- **Obstacle ID:** 30241
- **Distance Risk reason:** Obstacle is at 0.0m both longitudinally and laterally relative to the ego vehicle (right), suggesting a potential collision or extremely close proximity.
- **Distance safety score:** 1
- **Time Risk reason:** Although the lateral relative velocity indicates a slight separation (-0.01m/s), the longitudinal velocity shows the obstacle moving towards the ego vehicle (-2.52 m/s) while essentially aligned.  This signifies a high risk of collision.
- **Time safety score:** 1
- **Overall Risk score:** 1


- **Obstacle ID:** 30242
- **Distance Risk reason:** This obstacle is located behind and to the right of the ego vehicle at -5.17m longitudinally and -5.17m laterally. It is moving further away.
- **Distance safety score:** 5
- **Time Risk reason:** The obstacle's motion clearly shows it moving away from the ego vehicle both longitudinally (-3.89 m/s) and laterally (-0.28 m/s).
- **Time safety score:** 5
- **Overall Risk score:** 5



### Summary in JSON Format:
