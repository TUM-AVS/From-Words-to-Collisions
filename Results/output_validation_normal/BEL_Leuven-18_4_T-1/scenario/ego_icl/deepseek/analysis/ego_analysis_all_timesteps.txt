### Obstacle-by-Obstacle Analysis (Most Recent Timestep: 0.9s)

#### **Obstacle 30240 (Front-right)**
- **Adjusted Distances**: Longitudinal 11.74m, Lateral -1.94m  
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal -1.90 m/s (approaching), Lateral -0.03 m/s (moving away)  
- **Motion**: Driving toward ego longitudinally, moving away laterally  
- **TTC (Longitudinal)**: 11.74 / 1.90 ≈ 6.18s (No Risk)  
- **TTC (Lateral)**: N/A (moving away)  
- **MDC**: Lateral distance is stable/increasing (1.94m moving away) → No collision path  
- **Overall Risk**: 5 (No Risk)  

#### **Obstacle 30241 (Right, Exact Longitudinal Alignment)**
- **Adjusted Distances**: Longitudinal 0.00m (aligned), Lateral -1.89m  
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal -2.52 m/s (approaching), Lateral -0.01 m/s (negligible)  
- **Motion**: Exact longitudinal alignment, moving away laterally (but very slowly)  
- **TTC (Longitudinal)**: 0.00m alignment but no lateral convergence → No direct collision path  
- **MDC**: Lateral distance (1.89m) is stable/very slowly increasing → No immediate risk  
- **Overall Risk**: 5 (No Risk)  

#### **Obstacle 30242 (Rear-right)**
- **Adjusted Distances**: Longitudinal -5.17m (behind), Lateral -1.75m  
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal -3.89 m/s (moving away), Lateral -0.28 m/s (moving away)  
- **Motion**: Moving away in both dimensions  
- **TTC**: N/A (diverging paths)  
- **MDC**: Increasing distances in both dimensions → No Risk  
- **Overall Risk**: 5 (No Risk)

### Collision Scenario Determination
- **No obstacle** has a risk score of 0 (collision) or 1 (extreme risk).  
- Closest risk is Obstacle 30241 with longitudinal alignment but safe lateral distance (1.89m).
