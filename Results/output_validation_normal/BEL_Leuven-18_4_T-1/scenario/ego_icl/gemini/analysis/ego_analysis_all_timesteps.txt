* **Obstacle 30240 Analysis:**

    * **Trajectory:** Obstacle 30240 has been consistently in the front-right of the ego vehicle, with both longitudinal and lateral distances decreasing over the observed timesteps. However, the rate of approach seems to be slowing down in the most recent timesteps.
    * **TTC:**  Longitudinal TTC at 0.9s = 11.74m / 1.90 m/s â‰ˆ 6.2 seconds. Lateral TTC is not relevant as the lateral distance is increasing (-0.03m/s velocity).
    * **MDC:**  Given the trajectory and relative positions, the MDC is primarily determined by the lateral distance of 1.94m.  While the longitudinal distance is decreasing, it is not a primary collision concern given the current trajectory and lateral separation.
    * **Risk Assessment:** Based on MDC (1.94m) and TTC (6.2s), the individual risk assessments are Medium (3) and No Risk (5) respectively. Therefore, the overall risk is **Medium (3)**.


* **Obstacle 30241 Analysis:**

    * **Trajectory:**  Obstacle 30241 has been approaching the ego vehicle from the front-right, with the longitudinal distance significantly decreasing.  It reaches near-zero longitudinal distance (exact alignment) at 0.4s and remains there, moving slowly further to the right in the last timesteps.
    * **TTC:**  Longitudinal TTC is not applicable as the longitudinal distance is constant at 0.00m. The lateral velocity is slightly negative at -0.01m/s therefore the TTC laterally would not be relevant.
    * **MDC:**  The MDC is the lateral distance of 1.89m.
    * **Risk Assessment:** Based on MDC (1.89m), the risk is **Medium (3)**.


* **Obstacle 30242 Analysis:**

    * **Trajectory:** Obstacle 30242 is behind and to the right of the ego vehicle, and its distance is increasing in both directions throughout the scenario.
    * **TTC:** Not applicable due to diverging trajectory. 
    * **MDC:** Not applicable due to diverging trajectory.
    * **Risk Assessment:**  **No Risk (5)** as the obstacle is moving away from the ego vehicle.


* **Collision Scenario Determination:**

No obstacle has a risk score of 0 or 1. Therefore, this is NOT a collision scenario.
