### Obstacle-by-Obstacle Analysis

**Obstacle 30240**

- **Adjusted Longitudinal Distance (ALD):** 11.74 m
- **Adjusted Lateral Distance (ALATD):** 1.94 m
- **Relative Velocities:** Longitudinal -1.90 m/s, Lateral -0.03 m/s
- **Trajectory Analysis:**
  - Moving toward the ego vehicle longitudinally; lateral velocity close to zero, suggesting lateral movement has minimal impact.
- **TTC Calculation:**
  - Longitudinal TTC = 11.74 m / 1.90 m/s = 6.18 s (No Risk)
  - Lateral movement negligible due to near-zero velocity.
- **MDC Calculation:**
  - ALD and ALATD both > 5 m, confirming No Risk.
- **Risk Assessment:**
  - Longitudinal: No Risk (5)
  - Lateral: No Concern
  - **Overall Risk Score:** 5 (No Risk)

**Obstacle 30241**

- **Adjusted Longitudinal Distance (ALD):** 0.00 m
- **Adjusted Lateral Distance (ALATD):** 1.89 m
- **Relative Velocities:** Longitudinal -2.52 m/s, Lateral -0.01 m/s
- **Trajectory Analysis:**
  - Exact longitudinal alignment with ego, lateral movement away suggests minimal lateral risk.
  - Indicates critical collision risk due to longitudinal position.
- **TTC Calculation:**
  - Longitudinal position aligned, suggests current or very imminent collision.
- **MDC Calculation:**
  - Longitudinally aligned with ego, suggesting collision risk due to near-zero distance.
- **Risk Assessment:**
  - **Critical Finding:** Immediate or occurring collision due to exact alignment (distance â‰ˆ 0)
  - **Overall Risk Score:** 0 (Collision)

**Obstacle 30242**

- **Adjusted Longitudinal Distance (ALD):** -5.17 m
- **Adjusted Lateral Distance (ALATD):** 1.75 m
- **Relative Velocities:** Longitudinal -3.89 m/s, Lateral -0.28 m/s
- **Trajectory Analysis:**
  - Moving away from both longitudinally and laterally, increasing distance.
- **TTC Calculation:**
  - Longitudinal distance increasing as it's behind the ego vehicle.
- **MDC Calculation:**
  - Backward longitudinal distance increasing indicates diminishing risk of collision.
- **Risk Assessment:**
  - Longitudinal: No Risk (5)
  - Lateral: No risk due to increasing distance.
  - **Overall Risk Score:** 5 (No Risk)

### Collision Scenario Determination

The scenario should be classified as a COLLISION SCENARIO based on the analysis of Obstacle 30241. There's a confirmed collision due to the obstacle having an adjusted longitudinal distance of 0.00 m, indicating it is precisely aligned with the ego vehicle longitudinally.

The overall risk assessment confirms one obstacle (30241) currently poses a risk level of 0, indicating a collision is occurring.
