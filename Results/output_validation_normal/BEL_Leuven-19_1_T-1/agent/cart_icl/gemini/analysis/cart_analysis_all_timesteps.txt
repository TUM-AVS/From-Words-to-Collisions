At t=0.9s, the ego vehicle is moving slowly (0.587 m/s) in lanelet 103. Let's analyze the risk posed by each obstacle:

* **Obstacle 30166:** Located in lanelet 102, this obstacle poses no immediate risk due to lateral separation.  It is moving faster than the ego vehicle and is further away laterally.

* **Obstacle 30167:** Similar to 30166, this obstacle is in lanelet 102 and presents no immediate risk due to lateral separation and relative speed.

* **Obstacle 30169:** This obstacle is in the same lanelet (103) as the ego vehicle, but it's moving slower. The ego vehicle is approaching it from behind.  More data is needed about the relative positions and speeds to thoroughly assess TTC, but the risk appears to be low at this moment given the ego vehicle's slow speed.

* **Obstacle 30170:** Located in lanelet 824, this obstacle poses negligible risk due to lateral separation.

* **Obstacle 30171:** In lanelet 103, this obstacle is behind the ego vehicle and moving slower. At this time step, the risk is low. We need further time steps to assess future movement, especially if ego begins accelerating.

* **Obstacle 30172:** Located in lanelet 955, this obstacle presents no immediate risk due to lateral separation.

Overall, at t=0.9s, no obstacle poses an immediate collision risk.  Obstacle 30169 (same lane, slower speed) and 30171 (same lane, behind ego) require further monitoring in subsequent time steps to ensure safe longitudinal separation as the ego vehicle accelerates.
