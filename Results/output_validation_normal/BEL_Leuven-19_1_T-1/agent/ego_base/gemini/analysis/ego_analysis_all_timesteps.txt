At t=0.9s, Obstacle 30169 is closest to the ego vehicle longitudinally, at -5.16m behind.  While it's approaching the ego vehicle, its longitudinal velocity is relatively low (1.25 m/s) and it appears to be aligning laterally with the ego vehicle (lateral distance 0.00m, velocity -0.00 m/s). This obstacle warrants monitoring, but isn't an immediate collision risk. Obstacle 30170 is 4.28m in front and slightly to the left (1.47m), moving towards the ego longitudinally (-10.66 m/s) but away laterally (2.34 m/s).  Given the distances and velocities, this poses a low to medium risk. Obstacle 30172 is further away, at 14.52m in front and to the right (-6.63m).  It's moving towards the ego longitudinally (-5.74 m/s) and approaching laterally (8.33 m/s). This also presents a low to medium risk. Obstacles 30166 and 30167 are moving away from the ego vehicle and present negligible risk.  Obstacle 30171 is approaching from behind (-24.41m) at a moderate speed (6.65 m/s), posing a low risk currently.
