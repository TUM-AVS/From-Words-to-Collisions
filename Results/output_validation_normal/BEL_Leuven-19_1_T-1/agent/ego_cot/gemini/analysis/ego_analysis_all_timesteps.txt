### Safety analysis for timestep 0.9s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

**Assumptions and Clarifications:**

* **Missing Adjusted Distances:** The provided scenario lacks adjusted distances (adjusted_d_long, adjusted_d_lat).  This is critical for accurate TTC and MDC calculations.  I will proceed with the analysis using the provided *real* distances (DTClong, DTClat) but strongly emphasize that the results might be misleading without considering vehicle dimensions.  **You must provide adjusted distances for a reliable safety assessment.**
* **TTC Calculation:** TTC will be calculated as `TTC = Distance / Relative Velocity`.  A negative TTC indicates the objects are moving away from each other. A TTC close to 0 indicates imminent collision risk.
* **MDC Calculation:** In this analysis, MDC will be approximated as the minimum real distance observed during the scenario, keeping in mind that a proper MDC needs adjusted distances.

- **Obstacle ID: 30170**
- Distance Risk reason: Relatively close in front and to the left of the ego vehicle.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: Approaching the ego vehicle longitudinally, but the lateral movement suggests it might be turning/merging.
