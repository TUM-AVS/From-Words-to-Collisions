* **Obstacle 30166 (Behind):**  This obstacle is moving away from the ego vehicle both longitudinally and laterally.  The longitudinal distance is increasing, and the lateral distance is also increasing. There is no risk of collision.

* **Obstacle 30167 (Rear-left):** This obstacle is moving away from the ego vehicle longitudinally and has a stable lateral separation, suggesting no risk of collision. The obstacle was briefly assessed as a collision risk in earlier timesteps, but the most recent data indicates it has passed the ego vehicle.

* **Obstacle 30169 (Behind):** This obstacle is slowly approaching the ego vehicle longitudinally but maintains some distance. However, the lateral distance is near zero, meaning it's roughly in the same lane. This poses a low risk for now, but requires monitoring.

* **Obstacle 30170 (Front-left):** The longitudinal distance is decreasing, indicating the obstacle is driving toward the ego car longitudinally. However, the lateral distance is stable and relatively large. The overall assessment is a medium risk, primarily due to the decreasing longitudinal distance.

* **Obstacle 30171 (Rear-right):** This obstacle is approaching from behind longitudinally while moving slightly away laterally. It requires monitoring, but does not pose an immediate threat.  The risk assessment is low.

* **Obstacle 30172 (Front-right):**  This obstacle is approaching the ego vehicle both longitudinally and laterally from a diagonal position.  While the absolute distances are not extremely close, the converging trajectories need careful attention. This warrants a medium risk level.
