To evaluate the risk of collision for each obstacle in the most recent timestep (at 0.9 seconds), let's analyze each considering the adjusted distances, velocities, and motion descriptions across various timestep data provided.

**Obstacle 30166 Analysis:**
- Position: Behind the ego vehicle
- Adjusted Distances: Longitudinal -20.11m, Lateral 0.00m
- Relative Velocity: Longitudinal -14.20m/s, Lateral -1.09m/s
- Motion: Obstacle is moving away longitudinally.
- **Risk Assessment:** With a longitudinal distance of -20.11m and moving away, there is no immediate collision threat. The exact lateral alignment indicates that they are aligned in that dimension, but the longitudinal distance is significant. Risk is negligible.
- **Risk Level:** 5 (Negligible Risk)

**Obstacle 30167 Analysis:**
- Position: Rear-left of the ego vehicle
- Adjusted Distances: Longitudinal -3.33m, Lateral 2.11m
- Relative Velocity: Longitudinal -12.90m/s, Lateral 0.35m/s
- Motion: Obstacle is moving away longitudinally and laterally.
- **Risk Assessment:** Although relatively close behind, the combined distance across both dimensions is substantial, and the vehicle is moving away. There is no immediate threat.
- **Risk Level:** 5 (Negligible Risk)

**Obstacle 30169 Analysis:**
- Position: Behind the ego vehicle
- Adjusted Distances: Longitudinal -5.16m, Lateral 0.00m
- Relative Velocity: Longitudinal 1.25m/s, Lateral -0.00m/s
- Motion: Driving toward from behind with lateral alignment.
- **Risk Assessment:** The obstacle is aligned laterally but is approaching slowly from behind with minimal longitudinal velocity. While the risk is not negligible, the slow velocity results in a low-risk assessment.
- **Risk Level:** 4 (Low Risk)

**Obstacle 30170 Analysis:**
- Position: Front-left of the ego vehicle
- Adjusted Distances: Longitudinal 4.28m, Lateral 1.47m
- Relative Velocity: Longitudinal -10.66m/s, Lateral 2.34m/s
- Motion: Driving toward longitudinally and moving away laterally.
- **Risk Assessment:** The obstacle is close in both dimensions and approaching quickly longitudinally. The MDC is based on longitudinal distance given the velocity, reflecting a high risk of collision. 
- **Risk Level:** 2 (High Risk)

**Obstacle 30171 Analysis:**
- Position: Rear-right of the ego vehicle
- Adjusted Distances: Longitudinal -24.41m, Lateral -0.78m
- Relative Velocity: Longitudinal 6.65m/s, Lateral -0.71m/s
- Motion: Driving toward from behind and moving away laterally.
- **Risk Assessment:** Although approaching longitudinally, the substantial distance reduces the risk. The sideways motion has minimal impact. Therefore, the risk level remains low.
- **Risk Level:** 4 (Low Risk)

**Obstacle 30172 Analysis:**
- Position: Front-right of the ego vehicle
- Adjusted Distances: Longitudinal 14.52m, Lateral -6.63m
- Relative Velocity: Longitudinal -5.74m/s, Lateral 8.33m/s
- Motion: Driving toward both longitudinally and laterally.
- **Risk Assessment:** The obstruction is far in both dimensions, but the converging velocity necessitates consideration. However, the risk remains minimal at such distances.
- **Risk Level:** 4 (Low Risk)

**Risk Summary:**
1. Obstacle 30166 risks negligible due to significant distance and divergent path.
2. Obstacle 30167 risks negligible due to moving away trajectory.
3. Obstacle 30169 presents a low risk due to slow approach speed from behind.
4. Obstacle 30170 presents a high risk due to proximity and high closing longitudinal velocity.
5. Obstacle 30171 maintains a low risk with substantial distance despite its approach.
6. Obstacle 30172's low risk factor is ideal given its significant distance and trajectory.
