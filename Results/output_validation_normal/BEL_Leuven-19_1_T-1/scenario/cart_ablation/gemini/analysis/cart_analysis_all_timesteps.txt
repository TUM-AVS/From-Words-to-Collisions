At t=0.9s, Ego is in lanelet 103 with a small positive velocity and acceleration.

Obstacle 30169 is also in lanelet 103, relatively close to Ego (-210.2291, 535.126 vs -207.1533, 544.2906).  While it's moving slower than Ego and decelerating, the y-coordinate difference is shrinking over the observed time steps, representing a possible future collision risk if these trends continue. It represents a High (2) or Medium (3) risk, but not Collision or Extreme.

Obstacle 30171 is also in lanelet 103. It's further away from the Ego and moving slower. Given the current trajectories, the risk is assessed as Low (4).

Other obstacles are in different lanelets and do not pose an immediate collision threat within the observed timeframe.
