At t=0.9s, Ego is in lanelet 103 with a small positive velocity and acceleration.

* **Obstacle 30169:** This obstacle is also in lanelet 103, relatively close to Ego. While its velocity is decreasing, the positions are close enough to warrant concern, especially given the limited data provided. This obstacle represents a potential extreme risk.

* **Obstacle 30171:** Also in lanelet 103, approaching Ego from behind with higher velocity.  Given the short prediction horizon, further data is needed to accurately assess, but currently poses an extreme risk.

Other obstacles are in different lanelets and don't present immediate collision risks based on the current information.
