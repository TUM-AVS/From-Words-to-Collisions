### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. Ego is stationary initially, then starts moving slowly (velocity: 0.587 at 0.9s).
2. Obstacles 30166.0 and 30167.0 are in adjacent lanelet (102.0) and moving away.
3. Obstacle 30169.0 is in the same lanelet (103.0) but at a safe distance (~9m) and decelerating.
4. Other obstacles are far away or in different lanelets.
5. No immediate collision risk observed.
