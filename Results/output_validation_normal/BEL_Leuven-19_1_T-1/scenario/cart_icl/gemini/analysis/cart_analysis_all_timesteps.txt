- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 30172.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is far and moving away laterally.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Lateral velocity difference minimizes risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
No obstacle poses an immediate collision risk. The ego vehicle is starting to move slowly and other vehicles have differing trajectories, generally diverging from the ego vehicle's path and lane.  This is not a collision scenario.

### Summary in JSON Format:

  "CollisionObstacles": null,
  "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null,
  "ScenarioAnalysis": {
    "IsCollisionScenario": false,
    "Reasoning": "No obstacle is on a direct collision course with the ego vehicle. All obstacles maintain safe distances and exhibit diverging trajectories."
