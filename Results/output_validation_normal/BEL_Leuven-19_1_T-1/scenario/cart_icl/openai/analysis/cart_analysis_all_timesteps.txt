### Safety Analysis for the Most Recent Timestep

### Obstacle Analysis:

1. **Obstacle ID: 30165**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is in a different lanelet (324) and moving away from the ego vehicle. It shows no signs of posing a collision risk.
   - **Distance safety score**: 5
   - **Time Risk reason**: Maintains a high and increasing velocity over time, moving away and not intersecting the ego's path.
   - **Time safety score**: 5
   - **Overall Risk score**: 5

2. **Obstacle ID: 30166**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle in lanelet 102 is not approaching the ego directly, and its trajectory keeps it from directly intersecting the ego's path.
   - **Distance safety score**: 4
   - **Time Risk reason**: Although close in position, its increasing velocity and acceleration are directed away from the ego.
   - **Time safety score**: 4
   - **Overall Risk score**: 4

3. **Obstacle ID: 30167**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Primarily in lanelet 102 and lateral movement keeps it from the ego's path.
   - **Distance safety score**: 4
   - **Time Risk reason**: Velocity and acceleration are not directed towards the ego car, minimizing collision risk over time.
   - **Time safety score**: 4
   - **Overall Risk score**: 4

4. **Obstacle ID: 30169**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Shares lanelet 103 with the ego but maintains a safe distance due to low velocity and opposite direction of travel.
   - **Distance safety score**: 3
   - **Time Risk reason**: Low speed and reducing velocity diminish potential collision risk, though it remains close.
   - **Time safety score**: 3
   - **Overall Risk score**: 3

5. **Obstacle ID: 30170**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Situated in a different lanelet (824), primarily moving away or parallel.
   - **Distance safety score**: 4
   - **Time Risk reason**: No signs of potential collision. Velocity is directed away from the ego's course.
   - **Time safety score**: 4
   - **Overall Risk score**: 4

6. **Obstacle ID: 30171**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Located in the same lanelet but at a significantly different position ahead.
   - **Distance safety score**: 3
   - **Time Risk reason**: Slight chance of meeting the ego's path but current velocity and acceleration show no immediate threat.
   - **Time safety score**: 3
   - **Overall Risk score**: 3

7. **Obstacle ID: 30172**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Located away in another lanelet (955) and not intersecting.
   - **Distance safety score**: 5
   - **Time Risk reason**: Velocity and trajectory are not converging with the ego vehicle.
   - **Time safety score**: 5
   - **Overall Risk score**: 5

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis

- Based on the positional and velocity trends, none of the obstacles are on a direct collision course with the ego vehicle. Motion patterns show all potential safety concerns being addressed within the current scenario.
- At this timestep, changes suggest that the risks to the ego are low to moderate, with no immediate threats observed for collision or extreme hazards.
