Obstacle 30169 is at a longitudinal distance of -5.16m (behind the ego vehicle) and a lateral distance of 0.00m. It is moving towards the ego vehicle longitudinally with a relative velocity of 1.25 m/s.  Although it is currently behind the ego vehicle, the small relative velocity and proximity suggest a potential risk if the ego vehicle were to brake suddenly or reverse.

Obstacle 30170 is at a longitudinal distance of 4.28m (in front of the ego vehicle) and a lateral distance of 1.47m.  While it is moving towards the ego vehicle longitudinally with a relative velocity of -10.66 m/s, it's moving away laterally with a relative velocity of 2.34 m/s.  The lateral movement reduces the immediate risk, but the high longitudinal closing speed requires attention.
