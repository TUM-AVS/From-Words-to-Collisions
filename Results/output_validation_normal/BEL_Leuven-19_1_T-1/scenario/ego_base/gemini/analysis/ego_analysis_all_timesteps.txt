At t=0.9s, Obstacle 30170 is in the Front-left with a longitudinal distance of 4.28m and lateral distance of 1.47m, moving towards the ego vehicle longitudinally at -10.66 m/s and laterally at 2.34 m/s.  Obstacle 30172 is in the Front-right with longitudinal distance 14.52m and lateral distance -6.63m, moving towards the ego longitudinally at -5.74 m/s and laterally at 8.33 m/s. Obstacles 30166, 30167 and 30169 are behind the ego vehicle and moving away or pose less immediate risk than the front obstacles. Obstacle 30171 is also behind the ego car, but approaching from the rear-right.

While some obstacles are approaching, none are imminently close to colliding with the ego vehicle in the next timestep.

**Risk Levels and Definitions:**
<Collision (Score: 0)>: Actual collision has occurred or is unavoidable within the next timestep.
<Extreme Risk (Score: 1)>: Immediate collision or very high likelihood of impact. Urgent action is required.
<High Risk (Score: 2)>: Close to collision or highly probable collision path. Needs prompt attention and quick manoeuvring.
<Medium Risk (Score: 3)>: Moderate collision risk but manageable with timely reactions and proper strategies.
<Low Risk (Score: 4)>: Minimal collision risk. The situation is controllable with sufficient time to react.
<Negligible Risk (Score: 5)>: No significant collision risk. Obstacles are either moving away or far enough not to interfere.
