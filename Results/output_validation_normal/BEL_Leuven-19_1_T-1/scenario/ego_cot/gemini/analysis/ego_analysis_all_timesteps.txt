### Safety analysis for timestep 0.9 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

**Missing Information:** The provided scenario lacks crucial information for accurate TTC and MDC calculations.  Specifically, it's missing the adjusted longitudinal and lateral distances (adjusted_d_long, adjusted_d_lat).  Without these adjusted distances, and the dimensions of the ego vehicle and obstacles, accurate safety assessments are impossible.  I will proceed with a qualitative analysis based on the available information, but the results will be less precise.  It's crucial to provide the adjusted distances in the future for a proper quantitative analysis.

### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 30166**
- Distance Risk reason: Located behind the ego vehicle and moving away longitudinally. Lateral movement is nearly aligned with the ego vehicle.
- Distance safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
- Time Risk reason:  Moving away from the ego vehicle.
- Time safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 4 (Low Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 30167**
- Distance Risk reason: Located behind and to the left of the ego vehicle and moving away longitudinally. Lateral movement is nearly aligned with the ego vehicle.
- Distance safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
- Time Risk reason: Moving away from the ego vehicle.
- Time safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 4 (Low Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 30169**
- Distance Risk reason: Located behind the ego vehicle and slowly approaching longitudinally.  Lateral movement is nearly aligned with the ego vehicle.
- Distance safety score: 3 (Medium Risk)
- Time Risk reason:  Slowly closing longitudinally, requires monitoring.
- Time safety score: 3 (Medium Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 3 (Medium Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 30170**
- Distance Risk reason: Located in front and to the left, approaching the ego vehicle longitudinally, but the lateral movement suggests it might be diverging.
- Distance safety score: 3 (Medium Risk)
- Time Risk reason:  Requires more information (adjusted distances) to accurately assess TTC.  Longitudinal approach is a concern.
- Time safety score: 3 (Medium Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 3 (Medium Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 30171**
- Distance Risk reason: Located behind and to the right of the ego vehicle, approaching longitudinally. Lateral movement is away from the ego vehicle.
- Distance safety score: 3 (Medium Risk)
- Time Risk reason: Requires more information (adjusted distances) to determine TTC accurately. Longitudinal approach needs monitoring.
- Time safety score: 3 (Medium Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 3 (Medium Risk)


- **Obstacle ID: 30172**
- Distance Risk reason: Located in front and to the right of the ego vehicle. Approaching longitudinally but laterally moving away.
- Distance safety score: 3 (Medium Risk)
- Time Risk reason:  Requires more information (adjusted distances) to determine TTC. Longitudinal approach is a concern.
- Time safety score: 3 (Medium Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 3 (Medium Risk)


### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
  "CollisionObstacle": null,
  "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null,
  "IsCollisionScenario": false,
  "Justification": "No immediate collisions detected, but Obstacle 30169, 30170, 30171, and 30172 require careful monitoring due to their longitudinal approach and medium risk assessments. Accurate adjusted distances are crucial for a definitive collision risk assessment."
