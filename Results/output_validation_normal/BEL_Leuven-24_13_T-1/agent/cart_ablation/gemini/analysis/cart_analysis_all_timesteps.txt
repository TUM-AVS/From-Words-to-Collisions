Obstacle 30223 is in the same lane as the ego vehicle and is approaching from behind. While it's decelerating, its initial velocity is significantly higher than the ego vehicle's.  The longitudinal distance between the two is decreasing over time.  This presents a potential collision risk if the deceleration rates don't converge sufficiently.

Obstacle 30224 is in the adjacent lane and also traveling faster than the ego vehicle.  While the lateral separation provides some buffer, its trajectory should be monitored for potential lane changes or unpredictable behavior.

Given the closing longitudinal distance with Obstacle 30223 and the higher velocity of both obstacles relative to the ego vehicle, both should be considered high risk.  Obstacle 30223 poses the more immediate concern due to being in the same lane. However, based on the provided trajectory there is not an immediate or unavoidable collision.
