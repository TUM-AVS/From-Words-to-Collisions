Obstacle 30223 is in the same lane as the ego vehicle and is approaching from behind.  The distance between them is decreasing over time, but the rate of deceleration of both vehicles makes a collision in the very near future unlikely.  However, continued monitoring is necessary, as the situation could quickly change if the deceleration rates change significantly. Obstacle 30224 is in the adjacent lane and poses less risk.
