At t=0.9s, the ego vehicle is at (164.41, 348.02) with a velocity of 17.53 m/s. Obstacle 30223 is at (174.96, 338.18) with velocity 19.21 m/s, and Obstacle 30224 is at (179.23, 338.97) with a velocity of 19.16 m/s. Both obstacles are moving roughly in the same direction as the ego vehicle (based on similar orientations close to -0.75).

**Analysis:**

Both obstacles are ahead of the ego vehicle in the x-direction and slightly to its right (lower y-coordinate).  The key concern is Obstacle 30223 because it's closer to the ego vehicle's lane (lanelet 420) compared to Obstacle 30224 (lanelet 419).

Let's approximate TTC and MDC for Obstacle 30223:

* **Longitudinal TTC:** The x-distance is around 10.55 meters. The relative longitudinal velocity is approximately 19.21 - 17.53 = 1.68 m/s (obstacle is faster).  This gives a longitudinal TTC of roughly 10.55 / 1.68 ≈ 6.3 seconds.

* **Lateral TTC:** The y-distance is about 9.84 meters. Given the lanelet information and relatively straight trajectories, we can assume a low lateral velocity difference, hence a larger lateral TTC compared to the longitudinal one.

* **MDC:** The straight-line distance between the ego vehicle and Obstacle 30223 at t=0.9s is sqrt((10.55)^2 + (9.84)^2) ≈ 14.4 meters.

Although the TTC appears safe for now, the trends indicate decreasing x and y distances between the ego vehicle and Obstacle 30223.  The obstacle's higher velocity and the fact both are decelerating warrants caution.  If these trends continue, the risk will increase significantly over the next few seconds.  We must consider the possibility of lane changes or further deceleration of either the ego vehicle or the obstacle, which could lead to a collision.

**Risk Assessment:**

Given the lane markings, relative positions, and velocities, we assess the situation as follows:

* **Obstacle 30223:** High Risk (Overall Risk Score 2).  The obstacle is moderately close and on a concerning trajectory.

* **Obstacle 30224:** Medium Risk (Overall Risk Score 3).  Greater lateral separation than Obstacle 30223, and though its longitudinal distance to the ego is less, the lane separation reduces the immediate collision risk.
