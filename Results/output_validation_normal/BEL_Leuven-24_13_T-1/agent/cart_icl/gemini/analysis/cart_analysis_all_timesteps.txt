At t=0.9s, the ego vehicle is in lanelet 420. Let's analyze the two obstacles:

**Obstacle 30223:** This obstacle is also in lanelet 420, posing a potential collision risk.  The obstacle's x-coordinate is greater than the ego's, meaning it's ahead of the ego vehicle.  Let's approximate TTC using the most recent data points (0.8s and 0.9s).

* Approximate relative longitudinal velocity: (174.9574 - 173.5473) - (164.4127 - 163.1247) = 1.4101 - 1.288 = 0.1221 m/s (Obstacle is moving slightly faster than ego)
* Approximate relative longitudinal distance: 174.9574 - 164.4127 = 10.5447 m

Since the obstacle is ahead and moving slightly faster, there is no immediate collision risk, though maintaining safe following distance should be considered.

**Obstacle 30224:** This obstacle is in lanelet 419, a different lanelet than the ego vehicle. This significantly reduces the immediate risk of collision. Even if the x-coordinates suggest proximity along the direction of travel, the lateral separation due to different lanelets provides a safety margin.  We can still approximate some metrics for a more thorough analysis:

* Approximate relative longitudinal velocity: (179.233 - 177.8267) - (164.4127 - 163.1247) = 1.4063 - 1.288 = 0.1183 m/s (Obstacle is moving slightly faster than ego)
* Approximate longitudinal distance: 179.233 - 164.4127 = 14.8203m
* Lateral distance is not directly provided but inferred to be significant due to different lanelets.

Considering the lateral separation due to different lanelets and the longitudinal distance, the risk of collision with Obstacle 30224 is low.
