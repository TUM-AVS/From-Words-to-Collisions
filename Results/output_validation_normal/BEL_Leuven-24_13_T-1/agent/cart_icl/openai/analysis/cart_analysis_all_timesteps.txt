For the most recent timestep at 0.9 seconds:

**Ego Vehicle Analysis:**
- Position: (164.4127, 348.0248) in lanelet 420
- Velocity: 17.5338 m/s
- Orientation: -0.7459 rad
- Acceleration: -0.0034 m/s²

**Obstacle 30223 Analysis:**
- Position: (174.9574, 338.1794) in lanelet 420
- Velocity: 19.2113 m/s
- Orientation: -0.7525 rad
- The obstacle is positioned 10.5447 meters ahead longitudinally, within the same lanelet.
- Relative motion towards Ego: The relative velocity is calculated based on their orientations: 19.2113 - 17.5338 ≈ 1.6775 m/s (approximately closing in the forward lane).
- Lateral distance: The difference in y-coordinates is approximately 9.8454 meters.
  
**TTC and Risk Assessment:**
- To calculate Time To Collision (TTC), use the longitudinal distance of approximately 10.54 m with the relative velocity of 1.6775 m/s: TTC = 10.5447 / 1.6775 ≈ 6.28 seconds.
- While the obstacle shares the same lanelet with a closing trajectory, the TTC indicates no immediate risk of collision given the lateral distance.

**Obstacle 30224 Analysis:**
- Position: (179.233, 338.974) in lanelet 419
- Velocity: 19.1551 m/s
- Orientation: -0.7525 rad
- This obstacle is in an adjacent lanelet and significantly further from the Ego vehicle both longitudinally and laterally.
- Relative motion towards Ego: The obstacle is mainly traveling parallel to the Ego vehicle in a relative term.
  
**Distance and Risk Assessment:**
- Longitudinally, the obstacle is approximately 14.8203 meters ahead.
- Lateral overlap is low, as they are in different lanelets, preventing an immediate collision risk.
  
### Risk Summary
Given the analysis above, both obstacles maintain a safe trajectory concerning the Ego vehicle. However, considering lane overlap with Obstacle 30223 and its closer proximity, it's marked as medium risk.
