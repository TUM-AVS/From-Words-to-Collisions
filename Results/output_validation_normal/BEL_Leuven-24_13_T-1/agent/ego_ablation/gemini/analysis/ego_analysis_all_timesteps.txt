At the most recent timestep (0.9 seconds), both obstacles 30223 and 30224 are moving away longitudinally from the ego vehicle. Although obstacle 30224 shows a slight lateral movement towards the ego vehicle, the lateral distance is still significant (1.80 m), and the relative longitudinal motion indicates increasing separation. Considering the distances, relative velocities, and the short-term predictions provided, neither obstacle poses an immediate collision risk.
