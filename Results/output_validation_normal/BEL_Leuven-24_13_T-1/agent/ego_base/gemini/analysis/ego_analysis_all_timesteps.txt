At t=0.9s, Obstacle 30223 is moving away longitudinally at 1.68 m/s and is almost directly in front of the ego vehicle (0.0m lateral offset).  The longitudinal distance is increasing (9.92m). While the relative lateral velocity is slightly towards the ego vehicle (-0.13 m/s), the magnitude is small and the overall motion suggests a low risk.

Obstacle 30224 is also moving away longitudinally (1.62 m/s) and is positioned to the front-left (12.52m longitudinal and 1.80m lateral distance).  The lateral velocity indicates it is moving towards the ego vehicle (-0.13 m/s), but the magnitude is small and the lateral distance is relatively large. Thus, it also presents a low risk.

Both obstacles appear to be braking as evidenced by the negative longitudinal acceleration. However, given the current distances and velocities, no immediate collision is anticipated.
