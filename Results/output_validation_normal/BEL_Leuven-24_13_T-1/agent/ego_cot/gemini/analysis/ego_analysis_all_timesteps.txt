### Safety analysis for timestep 0.9s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

There are no adjusted distances provided in the scenario context.  Therefore, raw distances will be used for this analysis, acknowledging that this reduces the accuracy of the assessment.  It is *strongly* recommended that adjusted distances are included in future analyses.

**Assumptions:** Since no ego vehicle speed or dimensions are given, TTC calculations will be approximations based on relative velocities.  We'll assume a worst-case scenario where the ego vehicle's movement contributes to the collision risk.

### Obstacle Analysis:

**- Obstacle ID: 30223**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is in front of the ego car at 9.92m longitudinal and 9.92m lateral distance. This is a relatively safe distance.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: The obstacle is moving away longitudinally, reducing the risk of collision.  Without ego vehicle speed, a precise TTC is impossible, but the relative motion suggests low risk.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

**- Obstacle ID: 30224**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is in front-left of the ego car at 12.52m longitudinal and 12.52m lateral distance. This represents a safe distance.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: The obstacle is moving away longitudinally, while moving slightly towards the ego car laterally. Given the significant distance, this lateral movement does not pose a significant immediate threat.  A more precise TTC calculation is not possible without ego vehicle speed.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4
