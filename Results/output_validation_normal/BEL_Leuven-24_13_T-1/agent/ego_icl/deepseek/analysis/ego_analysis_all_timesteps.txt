### Obstacle-by-Obstacle Analysis:

#### Obstacle 30223 (Front of the ego car):
- **Adjusted Distance**: Longitudinal 9.92 m, Lateral 0.00 m
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal 1.68 m/s (moving away), Lateral -0.13 m/s (slight lateral movement)
- **Trajectory Analysis**: 
  - The obstacle is consistently moving away longitudinally (distance increasing from 7.58 m to 9.92 m over 0.9 seconds).
  - Lateral distance remains 0.00 m, indicating exact alignment but no lateral movement toward the ego vehicle.
- **TTC Calculation**: 
  - Longitudinal TTC: Not applicable (moving away).
  - Lateral TTC: Not applicable (lateral distance is stable at 0.00 m with negligible velocity).
- **MDC Calculation**: 
  - Longitudinal MDC: 9.92 m (Low Risk, MDC > 5.0 m).
  - Lateral MDC: 0.00 m (but no closing velocity, so no collision risk).
- **Overall Risk**: Negligible Risk (5). The obstacle is moving away and poses no threat.

#### Obstacle 30224 (Front-left of the ego car):
- **Adjusted Distance**: Longitudinal 12.52 m, Lateral 1.80 m
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal 1.62 m/s (moving away), Lateral -0.13 m/s (slight lateral movement toward ego).
- **Trajectory Analysis**: 
  - The obstacle is moving away longitudinally (distance increasing from 10.22 m to 12.52 m over 0.9 seconds).
  - Lateral distance is decreasing slightly (from 1.83 m to 1.80 m), but the rate is very slow.
- **TTC Calculation**: 
  - Longitudinal TTC: Not applicable (moving away).
  - Lateral TTC: 1.80 m / 0.13 m/s ≈ 13.85 s (No Risk, TTC > 5.0 s).
- **MDC Calculation**: 
  - Longitudinal MDC: 12.52 m (No Risk, MDC > 5.0 m).
  - Lateral MDC: 1.80 m (Low Risk, 1.0 < MDC ≤ 3.0 m).
- **Overall Risk**: Low Risk (4). The obstacle is moving away longitudinally and has minimal lateral movement toward the ego vehicle.

### Explanation:
- Neither obstacle poses a collision or extreme/high risk. Both are moving away from the ego vehicle longitudinally, and lateral movements are minimal.
- Obstacle 30223 is aligned laterally but has no closing velocity, so it is not a collision risk.
- Obstacle 30224 has a slight lateral movement toward the ego, but the distance is large and the rate is slow, resulting in low risk.
