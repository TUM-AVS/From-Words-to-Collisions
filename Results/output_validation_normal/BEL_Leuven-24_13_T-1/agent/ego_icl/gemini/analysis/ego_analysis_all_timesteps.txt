Obstacle 30223:
- Trajectory: This obstacle has remained directly in front of the ego vehicle (lateral distance 0.00m) throughout all timesteps, while its longitudinal distance has been consistently increasing. This indicates the obstacle is moving away from the ego vehicle.
- TTC: Since the relative longitudinal velocity is positive (moving away), TTC is not applicable in the longitudinal direction.  Lateral velocity is negligible and not considered for TTC as the car is moving away longitudinally.
- MDC: The minimum distance to collision is the current longitudinal distance, 9.92m at the last timestep.
- Risk Assessment: Based on the increasing distance and positive relative velocity, there is no collision risk.  Risk score: 5 (Negligible Risk)

Obstacle 30224:
- Trajectory: This obstacle is positioned to the front-left of the ego vehicle.  While its longitudinal distance has been increasing, the lateral distance has slightly decreased over the timesteps, but always greater than 1.7m. This suggests the obstacle might be slightly drifting towards the ego vehicle laterally while primarily moving away longitudinally.
- TTC: As the relative longitudinal velocity is positive (moving away), TTC is not applicable in the longitudinal direction. The slight lateral movement towards the ego vehicle is minimal and given the large lateral separation and primarily longitudinal movement away from the ego vehicle, lateral TTC is not relevant.
- MDC: The minimum distance to collision is primarily determined by the lateral distance, which is 1.80m at the last timestep.
- Risk Assessment: Considering the overall increasing distance, positive longitudinal relative velocity, and relatively stable lateral distance, the risk is low. Risk score: 4 (Low risk)
