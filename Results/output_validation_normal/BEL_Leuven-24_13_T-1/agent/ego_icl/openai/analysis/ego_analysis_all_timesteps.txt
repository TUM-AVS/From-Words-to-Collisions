### Obstacle Analysis

#### Obstacle 30223 (Front)
1. **Trajectory Analysis**:
   - **Longitudinal Distance**: Increasing over time from 7.58 m to 9.92 m.
   - **Longitudinal Velocity**: Decreasing, currently at 1.68 m/s.
   - **Lateral Distance**: Constant at 0.00 m; exact lateral alignment means in same lane but not necessarily a collision.
   - **Lateral Velocity**: Slightly negative, indicating slight divergence.
   - **Motion Description**: Obstacle is moving away longitudinally with exact lateral alignment.
2. **TTC & MDC Calculation**:
   - **Longitudinal TTC**: Given the positive distance and decreasing velocity, longitudinal divergence is occurring. Therefore, TTC is not a threat.
   - **Lateral TTC**: Not significant due to alignment gap and increasing divergence.
   - **MDC**: Determined primarily by lateral distance, which is 0 in alignment but not a concern due to divergent motion.
3. **Risk Assessment**:
   - With increasing longitudinal space and lateral alignment with movement away, thereâ€™s no immediate risk.
   - **Risk Level**: 5 (Negligible Risk)

#### Obstacle 30224 (Front-Left)
1. **Trajectory Analysis**:
   - **Longitudinal Distance**: Increasing from 10.22 m to 12.52 m.
   - **Lateral Distance**: Slight fluctuation from 1.83 m to 1.80 m.
   - **Longitudinal Velocity**: Decreasing to 1.62 m/s.
   - **Lateral Velocity**: Slightly negative, suggesting continued convergence but at a decreasing rate.
   - **Motion Description**: Moving away longitudinally, converging laterally from left.
2. **TTC & MDC Calculation**:
   - **Longitudinal TTC**: Distance is increasing, suggesting no immediate longitudinal collision.
   - **Lateral TTC**: With reducing rate of lateral convergence and increasing distance, lateral-only collision not impending.
   - **MDC**: Greater than 5 m given both distances expanding over time.
3. **Risk Assessment**:
   - Considering the divergence and real-time distances, overall risk remains low but slightly higher than 30223.
   - **Risk Level**: 5 (Negligible Risk)

### Summary

No significant collision or extreme risk is identified for either obstacles 30223 or 30224 at present considering trajectory and motion descriptions.
