At t=0.9s, Ego is in lanelet 420.

Obstacle 30223 is also in lanelet 420, posing a potential risk.  The x-positions are converging (Ego: 164.4127, Obstacle: 174.9574) and the y-positions are close (Ego: 348.0248, Obstacle: 338.1794). Given the velocities and decelerations, a collision in the next few timesteps is highly likely if both continue on their current paths.  This represents an Extreme Risk.

Obstacle 30224 is in lanelet 419, adjacent to Ego. Although the y-positions are relatively close (Ego: 348.0248, Obstacle: 338.974), the x-positions are separating. The lateral distance and different lanelets suggest a lower risk for this obstacle compared to 30223.  Therefore, while proximity should be monitored, it's not currently an extreme risk.
