### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep:

### Obstacle Analysis:
#### Obstacle ID: 30223.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is in the same lanelet (420.0) as the ego vehicle. Over the past timesteps, the distance between the ego and obstacle has been decreasing, but the lateral separation remains significant. The current distance is ~10.5m, which is manageable but closing.
- **Distance safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk)
- **Time Risk reason**: The relative velocity is ~1.68 m/s (ego: 17.53 m/s, obstacle: 19.21 m/s decelerating). TTC is ~6.25s, which is sufficient for reaction. The obstacle is decelerating faster than the ego.
- **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
- **Overall Risk score**: 3 (Medium Risk)

#### Obstacle ID: 30224.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is in adjacent lanelet (419.0) and moving parallel to the ego. The lateral distance is stable (~10m), and there is no significant convergence in trajectories.
- **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
- **Time Risk reason**: The relative velocity is ~1.62 m/s (ego: 17.53 m/s, obstacle: 19.16 m/s decelerating). TTC is effectively infinite due to lateral separation.
- **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low Risk)

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. **Trajectory Analysis**: Both obstacles are ahead of the ego but decelerating faster. Obstacle 30223.0 is in the same lanelet, while 30224.0 is in an adjacent lanelet with no convergence.
2. **Distance Trends**: The distance to 30223.0 is closing but at a manageable rate (~10.5m). No risk of lateral collision with 30224.0.
3. **Velocity/Acceleration**: Both obstacles are decelerating more aggressively than the ego, reducing collision risk over time.
4. **Conclusion**: No immediate collision risk. The scenario is controllable with moderate attention to 30223.0.
