### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 30220.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 30220.0 is in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle and its x-coordinate is getting closer to the ego vehicle over time, posing a potential longitudinal collision risk. Though the distance is not extremely close at this timestep, the trend suggests increasing risk.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason:  The relative longitudinal velocity between the ego vehicle and obstacle 30220.0 is decreasing, but the continuous approach in position over multiple timesteps suggests a medium risk.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3

- Obstacle ID: 30221.0
- Distance Risk reason: Located in a different lanelet and far from the ego vehicle, posing no immediate threat.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: No time-based risk due to the large spatial separation and differing trajectories.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 30222.0
- Distance Risk reason:  In a different lanelet and further away than 30220. Though x-coordinate suggests some longitudinal proximity, the lateral separation mitigates the risk.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: The lateral separation and different lanelets suggest no immediate time-related risk.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- Obstacle ID: 30223.0
- Distance Risk reason: This obstacle is in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle and poses a considerable longitudinal risk due to its proximity and approach trajectory observed over multiple timesteps.
- Distance safety score: 2
- Time Risk reason: The relative longitudinal velocity between the ego vehicle and obstacle 30223.0, combined with its proximity, indicates a high time-related risk.
- Time safety score: 2
- Overall Risk score: 2

- Obstacle ID: 30224.0
- Distance Risk reason: Located in a different lanelet, offering some lateral safety margin, but its longitudinal position is very close to the ego vehicle indicating a potential collision risk.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: The longitudinal proximity and closing velocity trend over time warrants attention.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3


- Obstacle ID: 30225.0
- Distance Risk reason: Situated in a different lanelet and spatially separated from the ego vehicle, implying no collision risk.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason:  The large distance and differing trajectories indicate no time-related risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 30226.0
- Distance Risk reason: Located in a different lanelet and far from the ego vehicle, posing no collision risk.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: The spatial separation and different trajectories indicate no time-based risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 30227.0
- Distance Risk reason: Located in a different lanelet and far from the ego vehicle, posing no collision risk.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: The spatial separation and different trajectories indicate no time-based risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 30228.0
- Distance Risk reason: Located in a different lanelet and far from the ego vehicle, posing no collision risk.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: The spatial separation and different trajectories indicate no time-based risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 30229.0
- Distance Risk reason: Located in a different lanelet and far from the ego vehicle, posing no collision risk.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: The spatial separation and different trajectories indicate no time-based risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5


### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
This is not a collision scenario as no obstacle has a risk score of 0. However, obstacle 30223.0 presents a high risk (score 2) and requires close monitoring and potentially evasive maneuvers.
