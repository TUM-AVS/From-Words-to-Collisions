  - **Overall Risk score**: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 30228**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Positioned significantly away, unlikely to cause collision.
  - **Distance safety score**: 5
  - **Time Risk reason**: Low speed and high deceleration pose no immediate threat.
  - **Time safety score**: 5
  - **Overall Risk score**: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 30229**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Farther away in different lanelet reducing collision chance.
  - **Distance safety score**: 5
  - **Time Risk reason**: Its velocity and positioning indicate no collision trajectory.
  - **Time safety score**: 5
  - **Overall Risk score**: 5

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis

The scenario is not a collision scenario. None of the obstacles presented a collision risk score of 0. The overall risk for most is low to medium, indicating manageable conditions with proper actions. All critical threats are either manageable or improbable given the current trajectory and dynamics.
