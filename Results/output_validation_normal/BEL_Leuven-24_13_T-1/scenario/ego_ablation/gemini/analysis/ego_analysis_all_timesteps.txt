Obstacle 30223 is moving away longitudinally from the ego vehicle and poses no immediate risk. Although it shows some lateral movement towards the ego vehicle, the magnitude is small and the longitudinal distance is increasing.  Obstacle 30224 is also moving away longitudinally and the lateral movement towards the ego vehicle is minimal with increasing longitudinal distance over time. Thus, no immediate collision risk is observed.
