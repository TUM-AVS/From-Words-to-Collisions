At t=0.9s, Obstacle 30223 is moving longitudinally away from the ego vehicle at 1.68 m/s and is located 9.92m ahead.  Laterally, it remains directly in front of the ego vehicle (0.00 m lateral distance), but its lateral velocity (-0.13 m/s) indicates slight movement towards the ego vehicle's lane. While its longitudinal motion poses no immediate threat, the lateral movement needs monitoring.

Obstacle 30224 is also moving longitudinally away at 1.62 m/s, positioned 12.52 m ahead and 1.80 m to the left.  Its lateral velocity of -0.13 m/s shows it's moving towards the ego vehicle's lane. Although the lateral movement warrants attention, the distance and relative velocities suggest no immediate danger.

Neither obstacle presents an immediate collision risk in the next timestep.
