### Safety analysis for timestep 0.9 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 30223**
- Distance Risk reason:  At 0.9 seconds, Obstacle 30223 is in front of the ego vehicle at a longitudinal distance of 9.92m and a lateral distance of 9.92m. Although it's moving away longitudinally, the consistent lateral distance suggests potential path convergence, requiring further observation. Since no adjusted distances are provided, I will use the raw distances.  A distance of 9.92m in both directions suggests no immediate risk.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Since the obstacle is moving away longitudinally, TTClong is not a primary concern.  However, the persistent lateral distance warrants attention. Without velocity information relative to a common reference point, a precise TTClat is difficult to determine. The lateral movement is minimal, suggesting low immediate risk.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 30224**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 30224 is located front-left of the ego vehicle at a longitudinal distance of 12.52m and a lateral distance of 12.52m.  Similar to Obstacle 30223, while the longitudinal motion indicates increasing separation, the lateral motion and distance require careful monitoring for potential convergence. Since no adjusted distances are provided, I will use the raw distances. A distance of 12.52m in both directions suggests no immediate risk.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: While moving away longitudinally (reducing risk), the persistent lateral distance needs attention due to the lateral movement towards the ego vehicle. Without more precise lateral velocity data or adjusted distances, TTClat cannot be precisely calculated.  However, considering the current distances and relatively small lateral velocities, the risk appears low.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4


### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
  "CollisionObstacle": null,
  "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null,
  "IsCollisionScenario": false,
  "Justification": "No obstacles pose an immediate collision risk. Both obstacles are moving away longitudinally and have substantial separation distances. Though lateral movements require further monitoring, currently, neither obstacle presents a high risk of collision within the predicted timeframe."
