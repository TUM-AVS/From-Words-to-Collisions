### Obstacle-by-Obstacle Analysis

#### Obstacle 30223 (Front of ego car)
- **Most Recent Timestep (0.9s):**
  - **Adjusted Distance:** Longitudinal 9.92 m, Lateral 0.00 m
  - **Relative Velocity:** Longitudinal 1.68 m/s (moving away), Lateral -0.13 m/s (moving toward)
  - **Motion Description:** Obstacle is moving away longitudinally. Exact lateral alignment or unknown case.
  
- **Trajectory Analysis:**
  - Longitudinal distance increases from 7.58 m to 9.92 m over 0.9s (moving away).
  - Lateral distance remains 0.00 m (exact alignment), but lateral velocity is very small (-0.13 m/s) and not significant enough to cause a collision.

- **TTC Calculation:**
  - Longitudinal: Not applicable (moving away).
  - Lateral: TTC = 0.00 m / 0.13 m/s = 0.00 s (but lateral distance is stable at 0.00 m with negligible movement).
  
- **MDC Calculation:**
  - Lateral MDC = 0.00 m (exact alignment), but no collision risk due to stable alignment and negligible lateral movement.

- **Risk Assessment:**
  - **TTC Risk:** 5 (No Risk, moving away longitudinally).
  - **MDC Risk:** 5 (No Risk, stable alignment).
  - **Overall Risk:** 5 (No Risk).

#### Obstacle 30224 (Front-left of ego car)
- **Most Recent Timestep (0.9s):**
  - **Adjusted Distance:** Longitudinal 12.52 m, Lateral 1.80 m
  - **Relative Velocity:** Longitudinal 1.62 m/s (moving away), Lateral -0.13 m/s (moving toward)
  - **Motion Description:** Obstacle is moving away longitudinally. Obstacle is driving toward the ego car laterally from the left.

- **Trajectory Analysis:**
  - Longitudinal distance increases from 10.22 m to 12.52 m over 0.9s (moving away).
  - Lateral distance decreases slightly from 1.83 m to 1.80 m over 0.9s (very slow lateral movement toward ego).

- **TTC Calculation:**
  - Longitudinal: Not applicable (moving away).
  - Lateral: TTC = 1.80 m / 0.13 m/s â‰ˆ 13.85 s (very high, no imminent collision).
  
- **MDC Calculation:**
  - Lateral MDC = 1.80 m (stable with minimal decrease).
  
- **Risk Assessment:**
  - **TTC Risk:** 5 (No Risk, TTC >> 5.0 s).
  - **MDC Risk:** 4 (Low Risk, MDC = 1.80 m > 1.0 m).
  - **Overall Risk:** 4 (Low Risk).

### Collision Scenario Determination
- Neither obstacle has a risk score of 0 (collision) or 1 (extreme risk).
- Obstacle 30223 is longitudinally moving away and laterally stable (no risk).
- Obstacle 30224 is longitudinally moving away and laterally very slowly approaching (low risk).
