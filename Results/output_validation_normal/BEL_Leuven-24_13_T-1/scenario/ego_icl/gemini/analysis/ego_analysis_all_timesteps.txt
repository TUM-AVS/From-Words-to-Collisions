Obstacle 30223:
- Trajectory Analysis: This obstacle is directly in front of the ego vehicle (lateral distance = 0.00m) and has been moving away longitudinally across all timesteps.
- At t=0.9s:
  - Longitudinal distance: 9.92m
  - Lateral distance: 0.00m
  - Longitudinal relative velocity: 1.68 m/s (moving away)
  - Lateral relative velocity: -0.13 m/s (moving slightly towards ego laterally, but negligible given the 0.00m lateral distance)
  - Longitudinal TTC: Not applicable as the vehicle is moving away.
  - Lateral TTC: Not applicable as the lateral distance is 0.00m and the lateral velocity is converging but small.

- MDC: Effectively 9.92m (longitudinal distance as there's exact lateral alignment).
- Risk Assessment:
  - Longitudinal Risk: 5 (No Risk) - Moving away
  - Lateral Risk: 5 (No Risk), given stable and large longitudinal separation and small lateral velocity.
  - Overall Risk: 5 (No Risk)

Obstacle 30224:
- Trajectory Analysis: This obstacle is in the front-left of the ego vehicle. While the longitudinal distance has consistently increased, the lateral distance has been decreasing slightly over the observed time steps.
- At t=0.9s:
  - Longitudinal distance: 12.52m
  - Lateral distance: 1.80m
  - Longitudinal relative velocity: 1.62 m/s (moving away)
  - Lateral relative velocity: -0.13 m/s (moving towards ego laterally)
  - Longitudinal TTC: Not applicable since the obstacle is moving away longitudinally.
  - Lateral TTC: 1.80m / 0.13 m/s â‰ˆ 13.85s

- MDC: 1.80m (lateral distance is the primary concern due to slight lateral closing velocity)
- Risk Assessment:
  - Longitudinal Risk: 5 (No Risk) - Moving away
  - Lateral Risk: 4 (Low risk), based on the current lateral distance and very slow closing velocity.
  - Overall Risk: 4 (Low Risk)

Collision Scenario Assessment:
No obstacle has a risk score of 0 or 1. Therefore, this is NOT a collision scenario.
