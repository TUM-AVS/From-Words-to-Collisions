### Obstacle-by-Obstacle Analysis

#### Obstacle 30223
**Trajectory Analysis:**
- Over the timesteps, obstacle 30223 consistently moved away from the ego vehicle longitudinally. 
- Longitudinal velocities decreased to 1.68 m/s, while lateral velocities decreased slightly but remained negative, suggesting lateral separation is not closing.

**Most Recent Timestep Adjustments:**
1. **Adjusted Longitudinal Distance:** Consider the reported longitudinal distance decreasing to 9.92 m (at 0.9 seconds).
2. **Adjusted Lateral Distance:** Consistently 0.00 m, indicating exact alignment but does not imply instantaneous collision.

**Calculations:**
- **Longitudinal TTC:** 9.92 / 1.68 ≈ 5.90 seconds (indicates no immediate collision)
- **Lateral MDC:** 0.00 m (alignment but not all collision-prone due to moving away)

**Risk Assessment:**
- Longitudinal risk minimal due to increasing distance.
- Lateral alignment with relative movement away indicates no immediate threat.
- **Risk Score:** 5 (No Risk)

#### Obstacle 30224
**Trajectory Analysis:**
- Obstacle 30224 is moving front-left to the ego vehicle.
- Both longitudinal and lateral velocities suggest it is generally moving away longitudinally but slightly converging laterally.

**Most Recent Timestep Adjustments:**
1. **Adjusted Longitudinal Distance:** 12.52 m
2. **Adjusted Lateral Distance:** 1.80 m (slightly increasing proximity)

**Calculations:**
- **Longitudinal TTC:** 12.52 / 1.62 ≈ 7.73 seconds (further confirmation no immediate longitudinal threat)
- **Lateral MDC:** 1.80 m (sufficiently large not to suggest collision risk)

**Risk Assessment:**
- Longitudinal aspect safe due to considerable separation remaining.
- Lateral approach noted, but distance is not critically reducing to pose danger imminently.
- **Risk Score:** 5 (No Risk)

### Collision Scenario Determination
Both obstacles, 30223 and 30224, are assessed with a risk score of 5, indicating no immediate collision or extreme risk under current motion characteristics.

{
    "CollisionObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "None",

    },
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "None",
        "OverallRiskScore": "None"
    },
    "IsCollisionScenario": false,
    "Justification": "Both obstacles have sufficiently greater distances and velocities indicating divergence or sufficient separation, resulting in no risk of collision."
}
``` 

In summary, the assessed adjusted distances, velocities, and acceleration do not indicate a collision scenario according to the provided models, as TTC for both obstacles is confirmed to exceed survival thresholds, while MDC remains non-threatening.
