Obstacle 30221 is in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle and its x-coordinate is approaching the ego vehicle's x-coordinate. While the y-coordinates are different, it is worth noting that obstacle 30221's velocity is decreasing, implying potential slowing/stopping which increases risk if its x-coordinate converges with the ego vehicle's. The other obstacles, particularly the stationary ones (30225, 30228), are not showing any immediate risk due to their static nature and different lanelets or sufficient distance. Obstacle 30241, although in a different lanelet, shares a close proximity in y-coordinate at times but poses no immediate threat due to diverging x-coordinates.
