Obstacle 30221 is in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle and its x-coordinate is getting closer to the ego vehicle's x-coordinate over time. While the y-coordinate difference is significant, obstacle 30221's decreasing velocity suggests it might slow down or stop, potentially posing a collision risk if the ego vehicle also decelerates.  Obstacles 30225 and 30228 are static and don't pose an immediate threat. Obstacles 30229 and 30241 are in a different lanelet. Obstacle 30241 is moving in roughly the same direction as the ego vehicle but significantly further away in y-coordinate, indicating a lower risk.
