At t=0.9s, the ego vehicle is at (255.5946, 266.331) and moving with a velocity of 6.1093 in a direction indicated by the orientation 2.2772 rad.  We need to analyze its position relative to each obstacle at this timestep and project their trajectories to assess collision risk.

**Obstacle Analysis at t=0.9s:**

* **Obstacle 30221:** Located at (245.3102, 277.7415), velocity 1.0829, lanelet 116.  This obstacle is in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle and poses the most significant risk.  Although the y-coordinate difference suggests some longitudinal separation, the obstacle's slow velocity combined with the ego vehicle's deceleration indicates a potential for collision if the ego continues to decelerate.  A more detailed analysis of closing velocities is needed.  Given the information so far, this represents a potential *High Risk*.

* **Obstacle 30225:** Static, located at (236.7443, 281.3463) in lanelet 115.  This obstacle is in a different lanelet and significantly to the side and behind the ego vehicle. *Negligible Risk*.

* **Obstacle 30228:** Static, located at (239.1781, 283.8602) in lanelet 116.  While in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle, it is far behind the ego vehicle. *Negligible Risk*.

* **Obstacle 30229:** Located at (242.6453, 275.4658), velocity 0.813, in lanelet 115. This obstacle is in a different lanelet and slightly behind the ego vehicle's position. Based on position and velocity, the risk is considered *Low Risk*.

* **Obstacle 30241:** Located at (265.0089, 248.5044), velocity 6.5665, in lanelet 115. This obstacle is in a different lanelet, and slightly ahead and to the right of the ego vehicle.  It is moving faster than the ego vehicle, reducing the likelihood of collision unless the ego vehicle steers into lanelet 115. *Low Risk*.


**Detailed Analysis for Obstacle 30221:**

To accurately assess the risk of collision with Obstacle 30221, we need to project the trajectories of both vehicles over a short time horizon. Given the decelerations involved, a simple linear projection may suffice for the next few time steps.  Since both are in the same lanelet, the main concern is longitudinal closing velocity. 

The ego vehicle appears to be braking significantly, while obstacle 30221 is only slightly decelerating.  The difference in their Y-positions is not large enough to rule out a collision, especially given the ego vehicle's deceleration. Therefore, the collision risk is elevated and warrants a *High Risk* classification.
