At t=0.9s, the ego vehicle (ID 30245) is located in lanelet 116 and moving with a decreasing velocity. Let's analyze the risk posed by each obstacle:

* **Obstacle 30221:** Located in the same lanelet (116) as the ego vehicle.  The distance between the ego and obstacle 30221 is decreasing over time.  Roughly, the x difference is around 10m and the y difference is around 11m. The obstacle's velocity is also decreasing, suggesting that a collision is not imminent in the very near future, but the situation requires monitoring. Medium risk.

* **Obstacle 30225:**  Located in lanelet 115.  Static and far from the ego vehicle. Negligible risk.

* **Obstacle 30228:**  Located in lanelet 116. Static and far from the ego vehicle.  Negligible risk.

* **Obstacle 30229:** Located in lanelet 115.  Relatively far from the ego vehicle and moving slowly. Negligible risk.

* **Obstacle 30241:** Located in lanelet 115. Although this obstacle is in a different lanelet, it's important to consider its motion relative to the ego vehicle.  The x values are close, and while the y values are different there isn't a lane change predicted for the ego vehicle.  Low risk.
