To assess the collision risk in this simulation scenario, let's evaluate the position, velocity, and acceleration of the ego vehicle and obstacles at the most recent timestep, which is 0.9 seconds.

### Analysis:

1. **Ego Vehicle (30245.0):**
   - Position: (255.5946, 266.331)
   - Velocity: 6.1093 m/s
   - Acceleration: -0.7233 m/s²
   - The ego vehicle is continuously decelerating.

2. **Obstacle 30221.0:**
   - Position: (245.3102, 277.7415)
   - Velocity: 1.0829 m/s
   - Acceleration: -1.294 m/s²
   - This obstacle is on the same lanelet as the ego vehicle and decelerating.
   - **Relative Position/Velocity**: The obstacle is farther behind with a relative distance of approximately 17.799 meters in the Y direction and closing in slowly due to lower speed.
   - **TTC and MDC**: Due to the relative position and the ego's quicker deceleration, no immediate collision risk is noted.

3. **Obstacle 30225.0:**
   - Position: (236.7443, 281.3463)
   - Velocity: 0.0 m/s
   - This obstacle is stationary in a different lanelet and poses no immediate threat.

4. **Obstacle 30228.0:**
   - Position: (239.1781, 283.8602)
   - Velocity: 0.0 m/s
   - Another stationary obstacle in the same lanelet as the ego but significantly far laterally, not posing an immediate threat.

5. **Obstacle 30229.0:**
   - Position: (242.6453, 275.4658)
   - Velocity: 0.813 m/s
   - This obstacle is moving very slowly and is in a different lanelet from the ego vehicle, maintaining a safe distance.

6. **Obstacle 30241.0:**
   - Position: (265.0089, 248.5044)
   - Velocity: 6.5665 m/s
   - In a different lanelet from the ego, moving at a velocity similar to the ego but positioned significantly ahead and below in the Y axis.
   - The relative lateral distance is large, and it moves away from the ego vehicle's path.

### Risk Assessment:
From this analysis, none of the obstacles pose a collision risk based on their positions, velocities, and accelerations. There is no requirement for an immediate evasive action by the ego vehicle as long as it continues its current path with steady deceleration.

### Summary:
- Collision risk is minimal for all obstacles.
- No obstacles are in extreme or high-risk zones.
