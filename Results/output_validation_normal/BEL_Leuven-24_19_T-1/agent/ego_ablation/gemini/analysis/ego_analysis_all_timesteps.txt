At t=0.9s, Obstacle 30221 is directly in front of the ego vehicle and closing at -5.03 m/s with a longitudinal distance of 10.85 meters. This represents a very high risk of collision if the ego vehicle does not brake or maneuver. Obstacle 30229 is also in the front-left, with a longitudinal distance of 10.85m and lateral distance of 2.31m, and a closing velocity of -5.30 m/s, but with increasing lateral separation, making a collision less likely with proper reaction. While other obstacles are present, they are further away and do not present an immediate risk in this timestep. Obstacles 30221 and 30229 both pose an extreme risk with scores 1, while others are less risky for this timestep.
