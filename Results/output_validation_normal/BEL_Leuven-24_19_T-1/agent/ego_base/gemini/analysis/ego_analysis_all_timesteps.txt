At t=0.9s, Obstacle 30221 is in front of the ego vehicle, at a longitudinal distance of 10.85m and closing at -5.03 m/s.  This represents a high risk of collision if the obstacle continues on its current trajectory. Obstacle 30229 is also relatively close at 10.85m longitudinally, but further laterally (2.31m) and moving slightly away laterally. This poses a medium risk. The other obstacles are further away and do not represent an immediate threat.
