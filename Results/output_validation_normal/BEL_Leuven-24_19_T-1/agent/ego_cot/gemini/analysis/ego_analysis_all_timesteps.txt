### Safety analysis for timestep 0.9s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

**Assumptions and Clarifications:**

* Since adjusted distances (adjusted_d_long, adjusted_d_lat) are not provided in the scenario context, the provided real distances (DTClong, DTClat) will be used for this analysis.  It is *highly recommended* to include the adjusted distances in future scenario descriptions for more accurate analysis.
* TTC calculations will be simplified due to the lack of adjusted distances and some uncertainties like explicit ego vehicle speed. I will provide qualitative TTC assessments based on relative velocities and distances.
* A more precise and quantitative analysis requires additional information, including ego vehicle dimensions, obstacle dimensions, and precise ego vehicle motion.
* I am assuming a simplified TTC calculation using distance/relative velocity. If the relative velocity is zero or close to zero and the distance is small, TTC will be considered very low.
* I am assuming a diagonal distance calculation using DTClong and DTClat.

### Obstacle Analysis:

**- Obstacle ID: 30221**
- Distance Risk reason:  Relatively close longitudinal and lateral distance (10.85m) in front of the ego vehicle, suggesting a potential collision risk if the relative velocity is not managed.
- Distance safety score: 2 (High Risk)
- Time Risk reason: The obstacle is driving toward the ego car longitudinally with a moderate relative speed. The relatively short distance suggests a short TTC.
- Time safety score: 2 (High Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 2 (High Risk)

**- Obstacle ID: 30225**
- Distance Risk reason:  Larger longitudinal and lateral distance (19.15m) front-left of the ego vehicle, suggesting a lower immediate risk.
- Distance safety score: 3 (Medium Risk)
- Time Risk reason:  The obstacle is driving toward the ego car longitudinally, but the larger distance provides more time to react.
- Time safety score: 3 (Medium Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 3 (Medium Risk)


**- Obstacle ID: 30228**
- Distance Risk reason: Similar to Obstacle 30225, larger longitudinal and lateral distance (19.48m) front of the ego vehicle.
- Distance safety score: 3 (Medium Risk)
- Time Risk reason: The obstacle is approaching longitudinally but the distance provides some buffer.
- Time safety score: 3 (Medium Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 3 (Medium Risk)


**- Obstacle ID: 30229**
- Distance Risk reason:  Relatively close longitudinal and lateral distance (10.85m) front-left, similar to Obstacle 30221, posing a potential collision risk.
- Distance safety score: 2 (High Risk)
- Time Risk reason: Moving towards the ego vehicle longitudinally with a moderate relative speed and small distance.
- Time safety score: 2 (High Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 2 (High Risk)


**- Obstacle ID: 30241**
- Distance Risk reason: Moderate longitudinal and lateral distance (15.16m) rear-left of the ego vehicle. The longitudinal movement is slightly toward the ego car from behind, but the overall risk is less immediate.
- Distance safety score: 3 (Medium Risk)
- Time Risk reason: While the lateral movement is toward the ego car, the longitudinal movement suggests the obstacle might not pose an immediate collision threat. More time to react compared to the front obstacles.
- Time safety score: 3 (Medium Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 3 (Medium Risk)
