Obstacle 30221: Located in front and longitudinally aligned with the ego vehicle. The longitudinal distance has been steadily decreasing across all timesteps, indicating a closing motion. At the last timestep (0.9s), the longitudinal distance is 10.85m.  Given the relative longitudinal velocity of -5.03 m/s, the TTC is 10.85/5.03 ≈ 2.16 seconds. Although laterally aligned (0.00m), the slight lateral velocity and consistent longitudinal closing behavior suggests a medium risk.  MDC is assessed as approximately 10.85m.

Obstacle 30225: Located front-left. Both longitudinal and lateral distances are substantial (19.15m and 2.98m respectively at 0.9s) and show a decreasing trend but not alarmingly fast. No lateral relative motion. The longitudinal TTC is 19.15 / 6.11 ≈ 3.13s, placing this obstacle in the medium-risk category. MDC is approximately 19.15m longitudinally.

Obstacle 30228: Located in front and now longitudinally aligned (0.00m laterally).  The longitudinal distance has decreased to 19.48m at 0.9s with a closing velocity of -6.11m/s.  TTC is 19.48/6.11 ≈ 3.19s (medium risk). MDC is approximately 19.48m.

Obstacle 30229: Located front-left.  The longitudinal distance is decreasing (10.85m at 0.9s) with a closing velocity of -5.30 m/s.  TTC is 10.85 / 5.30 ≈ 2.05s (medium risk). However, lateral distance is also decreasing albeit slower, and now at 2.31m, increasing the risk slightly. MDC is primarily based on the longitudinal distance, so approximately 10.85m.

Obstacle 30241: Located rear-left.  The longitudinal distance is -15.16m (behind), and actually increasing slightly. This obstacle is not a collision concern longitudinally. However, the lateral distance is 2.80m and the obstacle has a lateral velocity of -0.52m/s indicating the obstacle getting closer. Even though the lateral distance is currently manageable, the consistent lateral closing behavior combined with a now positive and increasing longitudinal velocity (0.44m/s and accelerating) suggests a potential low to medium risk. MDC is assessed as the smaller lateral distance at 2.80m.
