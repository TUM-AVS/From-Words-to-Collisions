At t=0.9s, Ego is in lanelet 116.  Obstacle 30221 is also in lanelet 116 and is the closest obstacle. Analyzing the trajectories, both Ego and Obstacle 30221 appear to be moving in roughly the same direction, but Obstacle 30221's velocity is decreasing while Ego's velocity, though also decreasing, is significantly higher.  The distance between them is still considerable, and a collision is not imminent in the next few tenths of a second. Other obstacles are in different lanelets and pose no immediate threat. Therefore, no obstacle presents a collision or extreme risk.
