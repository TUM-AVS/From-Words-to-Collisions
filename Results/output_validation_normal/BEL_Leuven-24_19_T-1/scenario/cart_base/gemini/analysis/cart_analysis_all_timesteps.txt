At t=0.9s, Ego is in lanelet 116.

Obstacle 30221 is also in lanelet 116 and is the closest obstacle to Ego.  While the velocity difference is significant (Ego ~6.1 m/s, Obstacle 30221 ~1.1 m/s) and decreasing, the positions (Ego: (255.59, 266.33), Obstacle 30221: (245.31, 277.74)) and decreasing velocity of obstacle 30221 suggest a possible rear-end collision in the near future if Ego does not decelerate or obstacle 30221 doesn't accelerate. This constitutes an extreme risk.

Obstacles 30225 and 30228 are stationary and relatively far from Ego, representing negligible risk. Obstacle 30229 and 30241 are in lanelet 115, separate from Ego, hence posing no immediate threat.

  },
  "ScenarioAnalysis": {
    "IsCollisionScenario": false,
    "Reasoning": "Obstacle 30221 poses an extreme risk due to its proximity and low, decreasing speed in the same lanelet as Ego, suggesting a likely rear-end collision if Ego doesn't react appropriately.  No collision has occurred yet."
