### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 30221.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 30221.0 is in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle and its y-coordinate is greater than the ego vehicle's, meaning it's ahead.  While the distance between them has decreased slightly over the timesteps, it's still a safe distance.  Both are moving in roughly the same direction and appear to be slowing down.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: The relative velocity between the ego vehicle and obstacle 30221.0 is decreasing over time, as both vehicles decelerate. The consistent deceleration trend suggests the risk of collision is reducing.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- Obstacle ID: 30225.0
- Distance Risk reason: This obstacle is stationary and in a different lanelet.  It poses no immediate threat.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: The obstacle is stationary, so no time-based risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 30228.0
- Distance Risk reason: This obstacle is stationary and in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle, however it's positioned significantly ahead and poses no immediate threat.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: The obstacle is stationary, so no time-based risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 30229.0
- Distance Risk reason: This obstacle is in a different lanelet and poses no immediate risk. Although it's close in terms of y-coordinate, its x-coordinate separates it laterally.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: It is moving slower than the ego vehicle and the distance between them is increasing. No immediate risk based on the current scenario.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 30241.0
- Distance Risk reason: This obstacle is in a different lanelet and its y-coordinate is less than the ego vehicle's, suggesting it's behind. It poses no immediate threat.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: The obstacle's trajectory suggests it's moving slightly slower than the ego vehicle. However, since it's in a different lane, the time-to-collision isn't a major concern at present.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5


### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. **Most critical obstacle:** Obstacle 30221.0 is the most critical as it's in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle and ahead, although at a safe distance.
2. **Trajectory analysis:** Over the 10 timesteps, both the ego vehicle and obstacle 30221.0 are moving in a roughly similar direction with decreasing velocities. The distance between them fluctuates slightly but remains relatively safe.
3. **Relative positions, velocities, and accelerations:** Both are decelerating. The relative velocity is decreasing, suggesting a reduced risk of collision over time.
4. **Collision determination:** No collision has occurred or is imminent based on the provided data.
5. **Reasoning:** Although 30221.0 is in the same lane and ahead of the ego vehicle, the relative velocities, decelerations, and current separation suggest a safe situation.  A collision is unlikely given the observed trends.
