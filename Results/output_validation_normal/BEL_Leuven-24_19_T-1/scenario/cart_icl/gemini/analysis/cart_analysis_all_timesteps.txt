### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
No obstacles have a risk score of 0, indicating no immediate collisions. No obstacles have a score of 1, indicating no extreme risks. Some obstacles in adjacent lanelets are close enough to warrant attention (score of 3), but the ego vehicle's path appears clear in its current lanelet. The scenario is not a collision scenario.


### Summary in JSON Format: 
```json
{
  "CollisionObstacles": [],
  "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null,
  "ScenarioAnalysis": {
    "IsCollisionScenario": false,
    "Reasoning": "No obstacle has a risk score of 0 or 1. Obstacles 30221.0 and 30229.0 in adjacent lanelets pose some risk (score 3), requiring monitoring, but the ego vehicle's path appears safe in its current lane."
