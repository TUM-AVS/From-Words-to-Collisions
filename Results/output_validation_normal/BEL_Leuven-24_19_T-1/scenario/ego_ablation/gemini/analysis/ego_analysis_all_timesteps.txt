Obstacle 30221 is directly in front of the ego vehicle and closing at -5.03 m/s.  At a distance of 10.85 meters, this presents an extreme risk. Obstacle 30229 is also approaching the ego vehicle and is only 10.85 meters away, but it has a lateral distance of 2.31 m and is slightly moving away laterally, making it less risky than 30221. Obstacle 30241 is moving towards the ego from the rear left, but poses no immediate threat. Obstacles 30225 and 30228 are further away and therefore present less of a risk than obstacles 30221 and 30229.
