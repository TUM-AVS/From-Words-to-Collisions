Obstacle 30221 is in front of the ego vehicle and approaching longitudinally with a real distance of 10.85 meters.  Although it has a small lateral velocity (0.07 m/s) and the lateral distance is 0.00m, indicating it is directly ahead or the lateral movement is unknown, the closing longitudinal velocity (-5.03 m/s) suggests a possible collision if the ego vehicle or the obstacle doesn't brake or steer within the next few seconds. This obstacle needs to be monitored carefully.

Obstacle 30229 is also approaching the ego vehicle from the front-left, with a real distance of 10.85 meters and a lateral distance of 2.31 meters. The longitudinal velocity (-5.30 m/s) indicates it is moving towards the ego vehicle, while the lateral velocity (0.06 m/s) suggests a slight lateral movement away from the ego car. While this obstacle poses less of a direct collision risk than 30221, it still requires attention.

Obstacle 30225 and 30228 are further away than the previous two, and though they are moving towards the ego car, they don't pose an immediate risk.

Obstacle 30241 is behind the ego vehicle and moving away longitudinally, though getting closer laterally.  This obstacle poses no immediate risk at this time.

Because Obstacle 30221 is quite close and approaching rapidly along the longitudinal axis, there exists a potential collision risk within the next couple of seconds if no evasive action is taken. Therefore, it qualifies as an extreme risk.
