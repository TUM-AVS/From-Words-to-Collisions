### Safety analysis for timestep 0.9 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

**Assumptions and Clarifications:**

* Since adjusted distances (adjusted_d_long, adjusted_d_lat) are not provided in the scenario context, the provided real distances (DTClong, DTClat) will be used for this analysis.  This is not ideal and a real system should *always* use adjusted distances that account for vehicle size.
* TTC will be approximated using distance/velocity.  Since we only have a few timesteps, a more precise calculation isn't feasible.  A real system would use more sophisticated TTC calculations.
*  A simplified risk assessment logic is applied based on distance and TTC due to the lack of precise information.  A real autonomous driving system uses more complex algorithms.
* I'm assuming "Exact lateral alignment or unknown case" implies potential lateral risk if the obstacle's lateral velocity changes unexpectedly.


### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 30221**
- Distance Risk reason:  Relatively close longitudinal distance (10.85m) and in front. Lateral distance (10.85m) also poses a risk given potential for lateral movement.
- Distance safety score: 2 (High Risk)
- Time Risk reason: Approaching quickly longitudinally (-5.03 m/s).
- Time safety score: 2 (High Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 2 (High Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 30225**
- Distance Risk reason:  Further longitudinal distance (19.15m) compared to other obstacles, but still approaching. Lateral distance (19.15m) provides some buffer.
- Distance safety score: 3 (Medium Risk)
- Time Risk reason: Approaching longitudinally (-6.11 m/s).
- Time safety score: 3 (Medium Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 3 (Medium Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 30228**
- Distance Risk reason: Similar to 30225, further away but still approaching.
- Distance safety score: 3 (Medium Risk)
- Time Risk reason: Approaching longitudinally (-6.11 m/s)
- Time safety score: 3 (Medium Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 3 (Medium Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 30229**
- Distance Risk reason: Close longitudinal distance (10.85m) and approaching.  However, moving slightly away laterally.
- Distance safety score: 2 (High Risk)
- Time Risk reason: Approaching longitudinally (-5.30 m/s).
- Time safety score: 2 (High Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 2 (High Risk)


- **Obstacle ID: 30241**
- Distance Risk reason:  Behind the ego vehicle longitudinally, but lateral distance (-15.16m) and lateral velocity (-0.52 m/s) indicate a potential side-swipe risk.
- Distance safety score: 3 (Medium Risk)
- Time Risk reason: Moving towards the ego vehicle from behind (0.44 m/s) but slowly.
- Time safety score: 3 (Medium Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 3 (Medium Risk)


### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
  "CollisionObstacle": null,
  "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {
    "ObstacleID": "30221",
    "OverallRiskScore": "2"
  },
    "IsCollisionScenario": false,
    "Justification": "Obstacle 30221 and 30229 present a high risk with closing longitudinal distances and moderate lateral distances. Although no immediate collision is predicted, the situation requires attention to avoid a potential collision in the next few seconds. No obstacle is on a direct collision course at this moment."
