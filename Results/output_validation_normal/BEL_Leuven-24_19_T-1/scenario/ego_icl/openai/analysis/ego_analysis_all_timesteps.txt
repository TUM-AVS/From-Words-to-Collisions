Below is the detailed risk assessment and analysis for each obstacle at the most recent timestamp (0.9 seconds), followed by the JSON summary:

### Obstacle Analysis

#### Obstacle 30221
- **Direction**: Front
- **Current Distances**: Adjusted longitudinal: 10.85m, Adjusted lateral: 0.00m
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal: -5.03 m/s (approaching), Lateral: 0.07 m/s (slight lateral motion)
- **Trajectory Analysis**: The obstacle is longitudinally aligned with the ego vehicle (lateral distance = 0.00m) and moving toward it with a significant negative relative velocity.
- **TTC Calculation (Longitudinal)**: |10.85m / 5.03 m/s| = 2.16s
- **MDC (Longitudinal)**: Given exact lateral alignment, MDC primarily concerns longitudinal distance which is currently decreasing.
- **Risk Assessment**: Medium risk due to approaching trajectory and TTC between 1.0s and 3.0s.

#### Obstacle 30225
- **Direction**: Front-left
- **Current Distances**: Adjusted longitudinal: 19.15m, Adjusted lateral: 2.98m
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal: -6.11 m/s, no lateral motion.
- **Trajectory Analysis**: The obstacle is slightly left of the ego and approaches longitudinally.
- **TTC Calculation (Longitudinal)**: |19.15m / 6.11 m/s| = 3.13s
- **MDC (Lateral dominant due to front-left position)**: Current lateral distance and trajectory suggest diverging paths.
- **Risk Assessment**: Low risk due to combined lateral distance and longitudinal TTC indicating minimal immediate threat.

#### Obstacle 30228
- **Direction**: Front
- **Current Distances**: Adjusted longitudinal: 19.48m, Adjusted lateral: 0.00m
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal: -6.11 m/s (approaching), Lateral: 0.00 m/s (aligned)
- **Trajectory Analysis**: Exact lateral alignment with longitudinal closing velocity.
- **TTC Calculation (Longitudinal)**: |19.48m / 6.11 m/s| = 3.19s
- **MDC (Primarily longitudinal)**: Current situation suggests monitoring though not imminent collision.
- **Risk Assessment**: Medium risk due to decreasing longitudinal distance but sufficient time to collision.

#### Obstacle 30229
- **Direction**: Front-left
- **Current Distances**: Adjusted longitudinal: 10.85m, Adjusted lateral: 2.31m
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal: -5.30 m/s, Lateral: 0.06 m/s
- **Trajectory Analysis**: The obstacle is moving toward the ego car, but trajectory shows it moving laterally left, indicating a diverging path.
- **TTC Calculation (Longitudinal)**: |10.85m / 5.30 m/s| = 2.05s
- **MDC (Consider both distances)**: Shows decreasing longitudinal proximity but lateral increasing, indicating divergence.
- **Risk Assessment**: Medium risk due to significant longitudinal proximity despite divergence.

#### Obstacle 30241
- **Direction**: Rear-left
- **Current Distances**: Adjusted longitudinal: -15.16m, Adjusted lateral: 2.80m
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal: 0.44 m/s (moving away), Lateral: -0.52 m/s
- **Trajectory Analysis**: This obstacle is moving away longitudinally but closing laterally.
- **Lateral TTC**: |2.80m / 0.52 m/s| = 5.38s (low immediate risk)
- **Risk Assessment**: Low risk as the obstacle is moving away longitudinally and will take time before a lateral threat materializes.

### Conclusion
In this analysis, no obstacle has an immediate threat level to qualify as a Collision (0) or Extreme Risk (1) scenario.
