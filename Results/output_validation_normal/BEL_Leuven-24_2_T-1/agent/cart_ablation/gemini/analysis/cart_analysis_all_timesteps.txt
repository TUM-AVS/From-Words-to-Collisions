Here's the analysis and the JSON output:

**Analysis:**

Both obstacles are moving in roughly the same direction as the ego vehicle.  Let's examine each:

* **Obstacle 30253.0:** This obstacle is in the same lane (420) as the ego vehicle and ahead of it.  The longitudinal distance between them is decreasing over time.  While the obstacle is decelerating, the rate of deceleration isn't drastically different from the ego's.  This poses a significant risk of collision if the trends continue. It represents a high risk.

* **Obstacle 30254.0:** This obstacle is in the adjacent lane (419). While it's closer laterally to the ego vehicle than Obstacle 30253.0, the lane separation provides a safety buffer. Additionally, the deceleration of this obstacle is less than that of the ego. This reduces the risk of collision. There does not appear to be an immediate collision risk.

**JSON Output:**
