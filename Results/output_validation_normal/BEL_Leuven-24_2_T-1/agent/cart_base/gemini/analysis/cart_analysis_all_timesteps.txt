Both obstacles are traveling in roughly the same direction as the ego vehicle. Obstacle 30253.0 is in the same lane as the ego vehicle, while 30254.0 is in the adjacent lane.

Analyzing Obstacle 30253.0: This obstacle starts considerably further ahead of the ego vehicle but is decelerating more aggressively. While the distance between them is decreasing, it's important to consider their relative velocities and the deceleration rates. Over the provided timeframe, a collision doesn't appear imminent, but the closing distance suggests a potential high risk if these trends continue.  It needs further monitoring.

Analyzing Obstacle 30254.0: This obstacle is in the adjacent lane and also further ahead. Its trajectory doesn't present an immediate collision risk.  It poses a lower risk than Obstacle 30253.0 due to lane separation.

Based on the provided data, there isn't enough information to definitively conclude a collision (risk score 0) or extreme risk (risk score 1) within the next second. However, Obstacle 30253.0 shows characteristics of a potential high risk (risk score 2) due to its position in the same lane and decreasing distance to the ego vehicle.
