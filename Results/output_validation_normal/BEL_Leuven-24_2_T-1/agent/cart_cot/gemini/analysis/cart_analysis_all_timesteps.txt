Here's a breakdown of the collision analysis at t=0.9s:

**Ego Vehicle State (t=0.9s):**
* Position: (123.4129, 385.2772)
* Velocity: 21.8047 
* Acceleration: -0.0023
* Lanelet: 420.0

**Obstacle 30253 State (t=0.9s):**
* Position: (139.4211, 370.7648)
* Velocity: 22.8836
* Acceleration: -3.1298
* Lanelet: 420.0

**Obstacle 30254 State (t=0.9s):**
* Position: (140.1687, 374.8112)
* Velocity: 20.5353
* Acceleration: -3.0256
* Lanelet: 419.0

**Analysis:**

1. **Obstacle 30253 (Lanelet 420):** This obstacle poses the most significant risk.  It's in the same lane as the ego vehicle and, although slightly behind in the lateral y-coordinate,  the x-coordinate difference is decreasing over time. The obstacle is also traveling faster than the ego vehicle. The small difference in longitudinal position, combined with these factors, makes a high risk of collision if their speeds and lane occupancy do not change drastically in the next few timesteps.



2. **Obstacle 30254 (Lanelet 419):** This obstacle is in the adjacent lane (419). While its x-coordinate is increasing and ahead of the ego vehicle, the lateral distance is not so large.  Given the vehicles' current states and assuming they maintain their general trajectory, this obstacle presents less risk than obstacle 30253. However, slight deviations or unexpected maneuvers could lead to a future collision.


**Metric Calculation (t=0.9s):**

Since we are primarily concerned with the immediate risk, a simplified approach to estimating risk is sufficient for this problem.  We will look at the change in relative positions over the last few timesteps.

* **Obstacle 30253:**
    * Longitudinal Distance Change (0.8s to 0.9s):  (139.4211 - 123.4129) - (137.7199 - 121.797) = 1.6012 - 1.5981 = 0.0031 - a slight increase in difference; not a collision threat right now
    * Lateral Distance Change (0.8s to 0.9s): abs(370.7648 - 385.2772) - abs(372.3071 - 386.7415) = 14.5124 - 14.4344 = 0.078 - closing the gap, which is not promising, but not indicative of immediate collision threat
    * Overall Risk Score: 2 (High Risk). The combination of being in the same lane, the closing lateral distance, and only a minuscule increase in longitudinal distance makes this obstacle a high risk.

* **Obstacle 30254:**
    * Longitudinal Distance Change (0.8s to 0.9s):  (140.1687 - 123.4129) - (138.6415 - 121.797) = 1.5272 - 1.5272 = 0 - neither closing nor diverging
    * Lateral Distance Change (0.8s to 0.9s): abs(374.8112 - 385.2772) - abs(376.1954 - 386.7415) = 10.466 - 10.5461 = -0.0801 - diverging laterally, which is good, but not by a large margin, so still possible for future collision threat.
    * Overall Risk Score: 3 (Medium Risk). Although the lateral distance is diverging, the longitudinal distance is staying the same.
