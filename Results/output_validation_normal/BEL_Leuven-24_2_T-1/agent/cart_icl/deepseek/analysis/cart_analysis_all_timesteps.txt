### Analysis:

1. **Obstacle 30253 (Same Lanelet 420.0 as Ego):**
   - **Position Trend**: The obstacle is ahead of the ego vehicle, with decreasing distance over time (from ~16.28m at 0.1s to ~15.96m at 0.9s).
   - **Relative Velocity**: The obstacle is decelerating faster than the ego (obstacle acceleration: ~-3.13 m/s² vs ego: ~-0.0023 m/s² at 0.9s), but its speed is still higher (22.88 m/s vs ego 21.80 m/s).
   - **TTC**: At 0.9s, relative longitudinal velocity = 22.8836 - 21.8047 = 1.0789 m/s. Distance = 139.4211 - 123.4129 = 16.0082m. TTC = 16.0082 / 1.0789 ≈ 14.84s (very long).
   - **Risk**: Low (TTC is high, and the obstacle is decelerating faster than ego). **Score: 4**.

2. **Obstacle 30254 (Adjacent Lanelet 419.0):**
   - **Position Trend**: The obstacle is ahead and to the side of the ego vehicle, with lateral separation (Y-coordinate difference: ~374.81 - 385.28 = -10.47m at 0.9s).
   - **Relative Velocity**: The obstacle is decelerating (acceleration ~-3.03 m/s²) and slower than ego (20.54 m/s vs ego 21.80 m/s).
   - **Lateral Distance**: ~10.47m (safe, no overlap in lanelets).
   - **Risk**: Negligible (large lateral separation, no convergence). **Score: 5**.
