At t=0.9s, the ego vehicle is at (123.41, 385.28) with a velocity of 21.8 m/s.  Let's analyze the two obstacles:

**Obstacle 30253:** Located at (139.42, 370.76), this obstacle is in the same lanelet (420) as the ego vehicle but significantly behind and to the left.  Its velocity is 22.88 m/s. The lateral distance is approximately 14.5m. While it's moving slightly faster than the ego vehicle, the significant lateral distance suggests low risk.

**Obstacle 30254:** Positioned at (140.17, 374.81), this obstacle is in a different lanelet (419) and also behind the ego vehicle to the left.  Its velocity is 20.54 m/s.  The lateral distance is approximately 10.5m and slightly closer longitudinally than obstacle 30253.  However, given the different lanelets and the current trajectories, the risk is assessed as low.

Analyzing the motion from previous timesteps confirms that both obstacles are consistently in different lanelets than the ego vehicle, and lateral distances are maintained.  Therefore, even though they are closing in longitudinally, there is no immediate danger.
