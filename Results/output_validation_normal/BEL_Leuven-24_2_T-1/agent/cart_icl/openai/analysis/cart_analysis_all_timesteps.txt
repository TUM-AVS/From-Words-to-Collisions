In the provided scenario, we need to assess the relative motion of the Ego vehicle in relation to two obstacles, positioned in different lanes. Let's evaluate each obstacle based on their trajectories and calculate the risk levels.

### Detailed Analysis:

#### Obstacle 30253:
- **Position at 0.9s**: (139.4211, 370.7648) in lanelet 420.0
- **Relative position**: It's on the same lanelet as the Ego, but towards its side.
- **Velocity and Acceleration**:
  - Velocity decreased from 25.7412 m/s to 22.8836 m/s.
  - Continues decelerating with acceleration becoming less negative, indicating a potential slow down.
- **Trajectory**: It’s consistently moving parallel to the Ego, maintaining a lateral offset, not a direct collision path.
- **Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC)**: At 0.9s, it remains outside the immediate collision path with a few meters of lateral distance.

#### Obstacle 30254:
- **Position at 0.9s**: (140.1687, 374.8112) in lanelet 419.0 (different lanelet than Ego)
- **Relative Position**: The obstacle is on an adjacent lanelet, further ensuring it doesn't pose an immediate lateral collision risk.
- **Velocity and Acceleration**:
  - Velocity decreased from 22.9192 m/s to 20.5353 m/s.
  - The trajectory indicates controlled deceleration.
- **Trajectory**: It remains on a lanelet parallel to but separate from the Ego’s, with enough lateral separation.
  
### Time-To-Collision (TTC) and Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC)

- **TTC**: Given the obstacle 30253 and Ego's paths remain relatively consistent and parallel with declining relative velocities, we can presume there’s no critical TTC indicating immediate risk for either vehicle.
- **MDC**: Both obstacles show sufficient lateral separation from the Ego vehicle, exceeding a safety margin that reduces collision threats.

### Risk Assessment:

- **Obstacle 30253**: Remains on the same lanelet with parallel movement but enough lateral offset and decreasing approach velocities. **Low Risk (4)**
- **Obstacle 30254**: Positioned in a different lanelet from the Ego vehicle with decreasing velocities and safe lateral distance. **Negligible Risk (5)**

### Conclusion:

There are no collision risks or extreme risks identified within the current time frame. Both obstacles reside within safe operational bounds, avoiding immediate threats to the Ego vehicle, with ample time to react.
