At the most recent timestep (0.9 seconds), Obstacle 30253 is moving away longitudinally from the ego vehicle at 1.08 m/s and is at a longitudinal distance of 17.10 meters.  Laterally, it's directly in front of the ego vehicle (0.00 m lateral distance) although the lateral velocity is negligible at this point.  This obstacle poses no immediate risk.

Obstacle 30254 is closing longitudinally at -1.27 m/s and is now 14.94 meters in front of the ego vehicle.  Laterally, it is closing from the left at a negligible rate and is at a lateral distance of 1.89 m. While the lateral movement isn't concerning, the longitudinal closing rate suggests this obstacle warrants further monitoring. It presents a potential risk if the current trend continues. It is considered a high risk given the short time horizon and closing speed.
