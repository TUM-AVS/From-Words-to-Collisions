At t=0.9s, Obstacle 30253 is moving away longitudinally at 1.08 m/s and is directly in front of the ego vehicle.  The longitudinal distance is 17.10m, posing no immediate threat. Obstacle 30254, however, is now approaching the ego vehicle both longitudinally (-1.27 m/s) and laterally.  While the lateral movement towards the ego vehicle from the left is concerning, the distances (14.94m longitudinal, 1.89m lateral) suggest the risk is not yet extreme or high, particularly given that measurements at prior timestamps suggest the vehicle primarily moves longitudinally. Hence, both obstacles are classified as medium risk (risk score 3) or lower.
