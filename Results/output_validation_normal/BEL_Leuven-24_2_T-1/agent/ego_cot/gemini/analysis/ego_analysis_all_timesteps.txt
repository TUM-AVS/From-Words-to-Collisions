### Safety analysis for timestep 0.9s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

**- Obstacle ID: 30253**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is moving away longitudinally and laterally.  The distance is large (17.1m longitudinal and lateral).
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Obstacle is moving away longitudinally. No TTC calculated as no collision risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

**- Obstacle ID: 30254**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is approaching longitudinally (14.94m) and laterally (14.94m), but still at a safe distance.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: While the obstacle is closing, the distances and relative velocities suggest sufficient time to react. Assuming constant velocity, a rough TTC calculation (distance/velocity) yields approximately 11.7 seconds longitudinally and a much longer time laterally which isn't relevant considering the mostly longitudinal movement of the obstacle relative to the ego vehicle..
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4
