### Analysis for Most Recent Timestep (0.9 seconds):

#### Obstacle 30253 (Front):
- **Position**: Front of ego car
- **Adjusted Distance**: Longitudinal 17.10 m, Lateral 0.00 m
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal 1.08 m/s (moving away), Lateral -0.00 m/s (stable)
- **Motion Description**: Obstacle is moving away longitudinally. Exact lateral alignment or unknown case.
- **Trajectory Analysis**: 
  - Longitudinal distance is increasing (from 15.32 m at 0.1s to 17.10 m at 0.9s).
  - Lateral distance remains stable at 0.00 m (same lane alignment).
  - No closing velocity in either dimension.
- **TTC**: Not applicable (relative velocity is positive in longitudinal, meaning moving away).
- **MDC**: Lateral distance is 0.00 m (same lane), but longitudinal distance is large and increasing. No collision risk.
- **Risk Assessment**: 
  - **Longitudinal**: No risk (distance increasing).
  - **Lateral**: No risk (stable alignment).
  - **Overall Risk**: 5 (Negligible Risk).

#### Obstacle 30254 (Front-left):
- **Position**: Front-left of ego car
- **Adjusted Distance**: Longitudinal 14.94 m, Lateral 1.89 m
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal -1.27 m/s (approaching), Lateral -0.00 m/s (stable)
- **Motion Description**: Obstacle is driving toward the ego car longitudinally. Obstacle is driving toward the ego car laterally from the left.
- **Trajectory Analysis**: 
  - Longitudinal distance is decreasing (from 15.18 m at 0.1s to 14.94 m at 0.9s).
  - Lateral distance is stable (from 1.94 m at 0.1s to 1.89 m at 0.9s).
  - Closing velocity in longitudinal direction (-1.27 m/s).
- **TTC**: 
  - Longitudinal: 14.94 m / 1.27 m/s = 11.76 s (No Risk).
  - Lateral: Not applicable (stable distance).
- **MDC**: 
  - Lateral distance is 1.89 m (Low Risk).
  - Longitudinal distance is large but decreasing (Low Risk).
- **Risk Assessment**: 
  - **Longitudinal**: Low Risk (MDC > 5.0 m, TTC > 5.0 s).
  - **Lateral**: Low Risk (MDC > 1.89 m).
  - **Overall Risk**: 4 (Low Risk).

### Explanation:
- **Obstacle 30253**: No collision or extreme risk. The obstacle is moving away longitudinally and is aligned laterally but not closing.
- **Obstacle 30254**: Low risk. The obstacle is approaching longitudinally but at a safe distance and time-to-collision. Lateral distance is stable.
- No obstacles pose a collision, extreme, or high risk in the current scenario.
