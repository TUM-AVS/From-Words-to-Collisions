Obstacle 30253:
- Trajectory: Consistently in front of the ego vehicle, laterally aligned (0.00m lateral distance). Longitudinal distance increasing across all timesteps, indicating the obstacle is moving away.
- Most Recent Timestep (0.9s): Longitudinal distance 17.10m, lateral 0.00m.  Relative longitudinal velocity 1.08 m/s (moving away).
- TTC: Not applicable due to separating longitudinal movement.
- MDC: 17.10m
- Risk Assessment: Negligible Risk (5) due to increasing distance and separating motion.

Obstacle 30254:
- Trajectory: Consistently in front-left of the ego vehicle. Initially moving away both longitudinally and laterally.  In later timesteps, starts driving towards the ego longitudinally while still moving slightly away laterally.
- Most Recent Timestep (0.9s): Longitudinal distance 14.94m, lateral distance 1.89m. Relative longitudinal velocity -1.27 m/s (approaching), relative lateral velocity -0.00 m/s.
- TTC (longitudinal): 14.94m / 1.27m/s = 11.76s.
- MDC:  Since obstacle and ego are driving toward each other, it's the minimum distance when projected paths intersect. Given the slight lateral separation and mostly longitudinal movement, we'll approximate MDC as the current longitudinal distance of 14.94m. 
- Risk Assessment: Negligible Risk (5) due to large distances and primarily separating lateral motion.
