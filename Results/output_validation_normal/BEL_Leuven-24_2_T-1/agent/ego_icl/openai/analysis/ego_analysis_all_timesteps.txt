### Analysis

#### Obstacle 30253
- **Position at 0.9 seconds:**
  - Adjusted Longitudinal Distance: 17.10 m
  - Adjusted Lateral Distance: 0.00 m
  - Relative Velocity: Longitudinal 1.08 m/s (moving away)
- **Trajectory Analysis:**
  - The obstacle is directly in front with exact lateral alignment.
  - Longitudinal distance is increasing over time, indicating the obstacle is moving away.
  - Relative acceleration is negative, showing deceleration or a decrease in relative velocity over time.
- **Risk Assessment:**
  - **MDC Calculation:** With a relative velocity moving away, MDC is high as distance is increasing.
  - **TTC Calculation:** Since the obstacle is moving away, TTC is effectively infinite for collision risk.
  - **Risk Score:** Given the increasing distance and lack of closing velocity, risk is negligible.

#### Obstacle 30254
- **Position at 0.9 seconds:**
  - Adjusted Longitudinal Distance: 14.94 m
  - Adjusted Lateral Distance: 1.89 m
  - Relative Velocity: Longitudinal -1.27 m/s (approaching), Lateral -0.00 m/s
- **Trajectory Analysis:**
  - Positioned front-left of the ego vehicle, moving toward both longitudinally and laterally.
  - Longitudinal distance slightly decreasing, and lateral distance increasing marginally, indicates potential approach.
  - Relative velocity indicates the obstacle is closing the gap, creating a potential collision risk over time.
- **Risk Assessment:**
  - **MDC Calculation:** Given the approach in both dimensions, MDC needs consideration in the scenario when paths could intersect.
  - **TTC Calculation:**
    - Longitudinal: |14.94 m / 1.27 m/s| â‰ˆ 11.76 seconds
    - Lateral: Increasing marginally, consistent with movement away.
  - **Overall Risk:** The only concern could be a closing trajectory; however, given the metrics, risk remains minimal due to the low relative speeds and increasing lateral offset.

### Conclusion
Both obstacles, 30253 and 30254, pose negligible risk to the ego vehicle based on the current trajectory and velocity data. The relative motions are diverging or insufficient to constitute any immediate risk.
