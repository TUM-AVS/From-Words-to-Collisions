At t=0.9s, Ego is in lanelet 420.

Obstacle 30253 is also in lanelet 420 and is closing in on the Ego vehicle from behind.  While the distance is still somewhat significant, both vehicles' decelerations are fluctuating, and Obstacle 30253 has consistently shown a higher deceleration magnitude. This raises the possibility of a risky situation if its deceleration continues at a much higher rate than Ego's, leading to a potential collision. Considering the fluctuating accelerations and the closing distance, this situation requires close monitoring but doesn't yet represent an *extreme* risk.

Obstacle 30254 is in the adjacent lane (419) and poses no immediate threat.
