At t=0.9s, Ego is in lanelet 420.

Obstacle 30253 is also in lanelet 420 and is the closest obstacle to Ego.  The positions are (123.4, 385.3) for Ego and (139.4, 370.8) for Obstacle 30253. While the x-positions suggest a longitudinal gap, the y-positions indicate a lateral convergence.  Given the converging trajectories observed over the past timesteps and the relatively small difference in y-position, this presents an extreme risk of collision.

Obstacle 30254 is in lanelet 419, adjacent to Ego's lanelet. Its position is (140.2, 374.8). While this obstacle is further away than Obstacle 30253, the continued lateral movement of both Ego and Obstacle 30254 over the preceding timesteps suggests a potential risk if this trend continues. However, at the current timestep, the risk is not classified as extreme or collision.
