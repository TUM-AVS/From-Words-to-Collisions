### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep (0.9 seconds):

### Obstacle Analysis:
1. **Obstacle ID: 30253 (Same lanelet as ego: 420.0)**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: 
     - Current distance to ego: ~16.0 units (calculated as Euclidean distance between (123.4129, 385.2772) and (139.4211, 370.7648)).
     - Over the past 9 timesteps, the distance has been decreasing but remains significant. Obstacle is ahead of ego in the same lanelet.
   - **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk - sufficient distance)
   - **Time Risk reason**: 
     - Relative velocity: ~1.08 units/s (ego: 21.8047, obstacle: 22.8836).
     - TTC: ~16.0 / 1.08 â‰ˆ 14.8s (very high).
     - Both vehicles are decelerating, with obstacle decelerating faster (-3.1298 vs ego -0.0023).
   - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low Risk)

2. **Obstacle ID: 30254 (Adjacent lanelet: 419.0)**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: 
     - Current distance to ego: ~16.8 units (calculated between (123.4129, 385.2772) and (140.1687, 374.8112)).
     - Over time, the obstacle has maintained a lateral offset in lanelet 419.0 with no convergence.
   - **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: 
     - Relative velocity: ~1.27 units/s (ego: 21.8047, obstacle: 20.5353).
     - TTC: N/A (diverging paths, obstacle is moving away laterally).
   - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. No obstacles are in immediate collision course with ego.
2. Obstacle 30253 is in the same lane but far ahead with decreasing relative velocity due to higher deceleration.
3. Obstacle 30254 is in an adjacent lane with diverging trajectory.
4. Both obstacles are either maintaining or increasing distance from ego.
5. No abrupt changes in acceleration or orientation observed.
