### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 30220**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is static and located far from the ego vehicle's trajectory.
  - **Distance safety score**: 5
  - **Time Risk reason**: No movement observed over time; there's no immediate collision risk.
  - **Time safety score**: 5
  - **Overall Risk score**: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 30221**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Positioned far from the ego vehicle, with decreasing velocity and no immediate path intersection.
  - **Distance safety score**: 4
  - **Time Risk reason**: Though initially moving, its velocity is decreasing; on separate trajectory.
  - **Time safety score**: 4
  - **Overall Risk score**: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 30222**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Static in a different lanelet, not intersecting with ego vehicle's path.
  - **Distance safety score**: 5
  - **Time Risk reason**: No velocity, no risk of approaching collision.
  - **Time safety score**: 5
  - **Overall Risk score**: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 30223**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Slowly moving with minimal trajectory change, parallel lanelet to ego vehicle.
  - **Distance safety score**: 4
  - **Time Risk reason**: Low velocity, no significant change in position relative to ego vehicle.
  - **Time safety score**: 4
  - **Overall Risk score**: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 30224**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Almost static and far enough not to pose an immediate threat.
  - **Distance safety score**: 5
  - **Time Risk reason**: Minimal velocity and acceleration; distant over time.
  - **Time safety score**: 5
  - **Overall Risk score**: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 30225**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Distant and on a different trajectory, not on a collision course.
  - **Distance safety score**: 4
  - **Time Risk reason**: Consistent velocity but in a different path direction.
  - **Time safety score**: 4
  - **Overall Risk score**: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 30253**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Moving along a close trajectory with high speed, past trends show potential encounter.
  - **Distance safety score**: 2
  - **Time Risk reason**: High speed with decreasing distance could indicate a potential future collision.
  - **Time safety score**: 2
  - **Overall Risk score**: 2

- **Obstacle ID: 30254**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Similarly close trajectory to Ego, high speed.
  - **Distance safety score**: 2
  - **Time Risk reason**: Consistent high speed and trajectory suggest future encounter risk.
  - **Time safety score**: 2
  - **Overall Risk score**: 2

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
Checking all obstacles, none are on an immediate collision path with the ego vehicle at the current moment. However, obstacles 30253 and 30254 require ongoing monitoring due to their trajectory and speed indicating potential long-term risk, but not immediate collision.
