Obstacle 30254 shows some concerning behavior. While it maintains a lateral distance of 1.89 meters and is moving slightly towards the ego vehicle laterally, its longitudinal motion is more problematic. It's closing in at 1.27 m/s and decelerating at -2.24 m/sÂ².  This suggests potential for a risky situation if this trend continues, albeit the lateral movement is minimal.  It's a borderline Extreme Risk scenario. Obstacle 30253 continues to move away longitudinally and doesn't pose an immediate risk.

  "ScenarioAnalysis": {
    "IsCollisionScenario": false,
    "Reasoning": "Obstacle 30254 is approaching quickly longitudinally while slightly moving towards the ego laterally.  It is currently classified as High risk, bordering on Extreme Risk given the closing longitudinal velocity and predicted future states. No immediate collision is predicted, but the situation needs careful monitoring."
