Obstacle 30254 is approaching the ego vehicle both longitudinally and laterally.  At the most recent timestep (0.9 seconds), it's only 14.94m ahead and 1.89m to the left, and its relative longitudinal velocity is -1.27 m/s, meaning it's closing the distance. While not an immediate collision, the continuous approach and relatively short distance warrant attention. Obstacle 30253 is moving away longitudinally and presents no immediate risk.

**Risk Levels and Definitions:**
<Collision (Score: 0)>: Actual collision has occurred or is unavoidable within the next timestep.
<Extreme Risk (Score: 1)>: Immediate collision or very high likelihood of impact. Urgent action is required.
<High Risk (Score: 2)>: Close to collision or highly probable collision path. Needs prompt attention and quick manoeuvring.
<Medium Risk (Score: 3)>: Moderate collision risk but manageable with timely reactions and proper strategies.
<Low Risk (Score: 4)>: Minimal collision risk. The situation is controllable with sufficient time to react.
<Negligible Risk (Score: 5)>: No significant collision risk. Obstacles are either moving away or far enough not to interfere.
