### Safety analysis for timestep 0.9 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

There are no adjusted distances provided.  I will perform the analysis based on the provided real distances (DTClong, DTClat), relative velocities (Vrel_long, Vrel_lat), and relative accelerations (Arel_long, Arel_lat), but please note that this analysis would be more accurate with adjusted distances.  I'll make assumptions about vehicle size where necessary, approximating a vehicle width and length of 2 meters.

### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 30253**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is located in front of the ego vehicle at a longitudinal distance of 17.10m and a lateral distance of 17.10m. This positioning, given the lateral distance is significantly larger than the approximate vehicle width (2m), indicates minimal risk from a distance perspective. The obstacle being directly in front (longitudinally aligned) with such a large lateral distance isn't a direct threat.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: The obstacle is moving away longitudinally at 1.08 m/s and the lateral velocity is essentially zero (-0.00 m/s). This further supports the low risk assessment as the separation is increasing.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5


- **Obstacle ID: 30254**
- Distance Risk reason:  Obstacle is located front-left of the ego vehicle at a longitudinal distance of 14.94m and a lateral distance of 14.94m. Similar to Obstacle 30253, the large lateral distance reduces the risk, even though it's closer longitudinally.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: The obstacle is approaching longitudinally at -1.27 m/s. Though moving closer, the relatively small closing velocity and substantial longitudinal separation still provide ample time to react. The lateral velocity is near zero (-0.00 m/s), indicating the obstacle's lateral movement is minimal at this timestep.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4
