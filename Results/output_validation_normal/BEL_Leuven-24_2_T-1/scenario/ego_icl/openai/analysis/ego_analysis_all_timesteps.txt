### Obstacle-by-Obstacle Analysis

#### Obstacle 30253

**Trajectory analysis:**
- The obstacle is directly in front of the ego vehicle and observed to be constantly increasing its longitudinal distance with the ego, indicating a movement away scenario longitudinally.
- Longitudinal relative velocity is positive, which means it is indeed moving away.

**Most recent timestep data:**
- Adjusted longitudinal distance: 17.10 m
- Lateral distance: 0.00 m (exactly aligned laterally)
- Longitudinal relative velocity: 1.08 m/s (positive, moving away)
- Motion Description: Obstacle is moving away longitudinally.

**TTC calculation:**
- Since the obstacle is moving away longitudinally, the TTC in the longitudinal direction is not applicable as a collision is not foreseeable in this dimension.

**MDC calculation:**
- MDC = Lateral distance = 0.00 m

**Risk Assessment:**
- Longitudinally, given the increasing distance and positive relative velocity, no collision is possible at the current trajectory.
- Laterally, although the MDC calculation results in 0.00 m due to exact alignment in this dimension, the overall movement of Obstacle 30253 (moving away) suggests that lateral collision risk is not imminent.
- Overall: No Risk (5)

#### Obstacle 30254

**Trajectory analysis:**
- Positioned in the front-left position, this obstacle shows converging approach both longitudinally negative and lateral marginally moving away over the trajectory until the last moment where it moves toward the ego.
- Longitudinal relative velocity has switched to negative, indicating it is now moving toward the ego vehicle.

**Most recent timestep data:**
- Adjusted longitudinal distance: 14.94 m
- Lateral distance: 1.89 m
- Longitudinal relative velocity: -1.27 m/s (negative, moving toward)
- Lateral relative velocity: -0.00 m/s (holding steady to marginally moving away)
- Motion Description: Obstacle is driving toward the ego car longitudinally; moving laterally toward the left.

**TTC calculation (longitudinal):**
- TTC_longitudinal = 14.94 / 1.27 = 11.76 seconds

**MDC calculation:**
- As both proximity metrics suggest no immediate path intersection, MDC is mainly guided by lateral distance which keeps relatively steady or moving away:
- MDC = Lateral distance = 1.89 m

**Risk Assessment:**
- Longitudinally, the TTC remains high, and movements are not immediate or impending to create critical concern.
- Laterally, no sudden changes in pace reveal a potential for quick intersection.
- Medium Risk (3), given potential longitudinal convergence but mitigated by considerable distance and slow approach laterally.

### Conclusion
- **Obstacle 30253:** No Risk (5)
- **Obstacle 30254:** Medium Risk (3)

Since neither obstacle displays criteria indicating collision (0 score) or extreme risk (1 score), this scenario is not classed as a collision scenario.
