Obstacle 30242 is in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle and its x-coordinate is approaching the ego vehicle's x-coordinate.  Although obstacle 30242 is decelerating significantly, its y-coordinate is consistently increasing, placing it further ahead of the ego vehicle in their shared lanelet. This diverging behavior reduces the risk of a collision.

The remaining obstacles are in lanelet 115, while the ego vehicle is in lanelet 116.  These lanelets are presumed adjacent. While some obstacles are somewhat close in terms of absolute distance, none display a trajectory indicating an immediate or likely collision.

Given the current data, no obstacle presents a collision risk score of 0 or 1. Obstacle 30242 warrants monitoring due to its presence in the same lane, however its projected trajectory decreases the risk of a collision considerably.
