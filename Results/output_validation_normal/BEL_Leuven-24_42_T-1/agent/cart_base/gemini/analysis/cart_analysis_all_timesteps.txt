Obstacle 30242 is in the same lane as the ego vehicle (lanelet 116).  Its longitudinal position is decreasing, suggesting it is either stationary or moving slowly.  The ego vehicle is approaching obstacle 30242 from behind, and the ego vehicle's velocity is significantly higher than 30242.  The closing velocity suggests a high risk of collision if the ego vehicle doesn't brake or change lanes. While the lateral distances might seem large, the ego vehicle's deceleration rate is not aggressive enough to rule out a potential collision.

Other obstacles are in lanelet 115, adjacent to the ego vehicle.  While their trajectories should be monitored, the lane separation provides a safety margin, making them lower risk than obstacle 30242. However, the predicted positions of the ego vehicle and obstacle 30241 show a potential lane change of the ego vehicle might be necessary, requiring careful consideration of the surrounding vehicles in lanelet 115.
