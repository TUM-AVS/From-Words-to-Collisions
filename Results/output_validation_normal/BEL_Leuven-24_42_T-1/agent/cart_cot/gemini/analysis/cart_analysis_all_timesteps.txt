**Analysis and Risk Assessment:**

Focusing on the most recent timestep (t=0.9s) and considering the trajectories from previous timesteps, we analyze each obstacle:

* **Obstacle 30241:** This obstacle poses the highest risk. It is in the adjacent lane (115) and its y-coordinate (250.5045) is close to the ego vehicle's y-coordinate (253.2843). Although it's decelerating, the relative positions and velocities suggest a high risk of a lateral collision in the near future. This warrants a risk score of 2 (High Risk).

* **Obstacle 30242:** This obstacle shares the same lanelet (116) as the ego vehicle.  Its y-coordinate (269.8686) indicates it is ahead of the ego vehicle. Although it is decelerating, the difference in the y-coordinates suggests that a collision is less likely in the immediate future.  This obstacle merits a risk score of 3 (Medium Risk).

* **Other Obstacles:** Obstacles 30238, 30243, and 30249 are further away and their trajectories do not suggest an immediate collision risk.  They are assigned a risk score of 4 (Low Risk) or 5 (Negligible Risk).
