At t=0.9s, the ego vehicle (ID 30245) is located in lanelet 116 and traveling at 9.63 m/s.  Let's analyze the risk posed by each obstacle:

* **Obstacle 30238:** Stationary, far lateral distance in a different lanelet. Negligible risk.
* **Obstacle 30241:** Located in lanelet 115.  Lateral separation is significant. No immediate risk.
* **Obstacle 30242:** In the same lanelet as the ego vehicle (116), but located behind and moving slower. Although in the same lane, the relative motion suggests no immediate collision risk. Further monitoring is needed as its deceleration is inconsistent.
* **Obstacle 30243:** Located in lanelet 115 with considerable lateral distance. No immediate risk.
* **Obstacle 30249:**  Located in lanelet 115. Lateral separation is significant. No immediate risk.
