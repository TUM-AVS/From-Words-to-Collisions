### Analysis

**Ego Vehicle Analysis:**
- At 0.9 seconds, the Ego vehicle is at position (265.9058, 253.2843) with a velocity of 9.6307 and decelerating gently (-0.8264). Its trajectory shows a position shift primarily along the Y-axis, indicating a gradual directional change.

**Obstacle Assessments:**

1. **Obstacle 30241:**
   - At 0.9 seconds, position of (263.5561, 250.5045).
   - Relative longitudinal position: ~2.35m behind the Ego and closing.
   - Relative velocity: 4.555 (Ego is faster).
   - TTC = 2.35 / (9.6307 - 5.0757) = 0.52 seconds.
   - Lateral distance = ~2.78m.
   - **Analysis:** Short TTC and decreasing lateral distance create a high risk of collision if trends continue.
   - **Risk:** **High Risk (2)**

2. **Obstacle 30242:**
   - At 0.9 seconds, position (252.5642, 269.8686).
   - Effectively in the same lanelet and behind the Ego.
   - Significant distance and relatively slower velocity.
   - **Analysis:** No immediate risk due to significant distance and slower speeds.
   - **Risk:** **Negligible Risk (5)**

3. **Obstacle 30243:**
   - At 0.9 seconds, position (279.2819, 228.1708).
   - In a separate lanelet and not converging with the Ego's path.
   - **Analysis:** No immediate risk due to separate lanelets and trajectories.
   - **Risk:** **Negligible Risk (5)**

4. **Obstacle 30249:**
   - At 0.9 seconds, position (255.02, 261.5292).
   - Relative position not converging towards Ego, and slower velocity.
   - **Analysis:** Obstacle is not in immediate proximity and not converging.
   - **Risk:** **Negligible Risk (5)**

5. **Obstacle 30238:**
   - At 0.9 seconds, position (247.4061, 270.3909).
   - Stationary or slowly moving, not in the Ego's path in lanelet 115.
   - **Analysis:** Not in the path of the Ego, posed no practical impact.
   - **Risk:** **Negligible Risk (5)**

### Conclusion

The primary concern is with **Obstacle 30241** due to its proximity and converging trajectory with the Ego. The other obstacles are either in different lanes or too distant to pose any immediate risk.
