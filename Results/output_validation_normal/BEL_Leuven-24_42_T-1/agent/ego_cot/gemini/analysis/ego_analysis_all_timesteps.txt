### Safety analysis for timestep 0.9 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

**Assumptions and Calculations:**

* **Adjusted Distance:**  Since no vehicle sizes are provided, I'm assuming the provided longitudinal and lateral distances are already adjusted for vehicle size.  If this is not the case, the analysis needs to be redone with proper adjustments.
* **TTC (Time to Collision):** Calculated as `TTC = Distance / Relative Velocity`. If `Relative Velocity` is zero or positive (moving away), TTC is considered infinite (no collision risk).
* **Focusing on the most recent timestamp (0.9s)** as instructed.

### Obstacle Analysis:

* **Obstacle ID: 30238**
    - Distance Risk reason:  Located 20.19m longitudinally and laterally in the front-left.  This is a safe distance.
    - Distance safety score: 5
    - Time Risk reason:  Approaching longitudinally at -9.37 m/s. Assuming constant velocity, TTC is approximately 20.19m / 9.37m/s = 2.15 seconds. This provides ample time to react.
    - Time safety score: 4
    - Overall Risk score: 4 (Low Risk)

* **Obstacle ID: 30241**
    - Distance Risk reason:  Located at 0.0m longitudinally and laterally to the left, but moving away laterally to the left.
    - Distance safety score: 5
    - Time Risk reason: Moving away longitudinally and laterally.
    - Time safety score: 5
    - Overall Risk score: 5 (Negligible risk)

* **Obstacle ID: 30242**
    - Distance Risk reason: Located 16.75m longitudinally and laterally in front. This is a safe distance, for now.
    - Distance safety score: 4
    - Time Risk reason: Approaching longitudinally at -6.88 m/s. Assuming constant velocity, TTC is approximately 16.75m / 6.88m/s = 2.43 seconds. This provides reasonable time to react.
    - Time safety score: 3
    - Overall Risk score: 3 (Medium Risk)

* **Obstacle ID: 30243**
    - Distance Risk reason: Located 23.68m behind and to the left but moving closer from the left laterally, however the distance is safe for now.
    - Distance safety score: 4
    - Time Risk reason: Moving away longitudinally. The lateral movement needs monitoring, but there's sufficient time to react based on the current data.
    - Time safety score: 4
    - Overall Risk score: 4 (Low Risk)


* **Obstacle ID: 30249**
    - Distance Risk reason: Located 8.55m longitudinally and laterally in the front-left. Getting closer.
    - Distance safety score: 3
    - Time Risk reason: Approaching longitudinally at -6.33 m/s. Assuming constant velocity, TTC is approximately 8.55m / 6.33m/s = 1.35 seconds.  This requires attention.
    - Time safety score: 2
    - Overall Risk score: 2 (High Risk)
