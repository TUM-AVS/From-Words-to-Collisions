Obstacle 30238:
- Trajectory: This obstacle appears at t=0.4s.  It is approaching the ego vehicle longitudinally but moving slightly away laterally.
- At t=0.9s: Longitudinal distance = 20.19m, Lateral distance = 3.38m, Longitudinal velocity = -9.37m/s, Lateral velocity = 0.03m/s.
- TTC (longitudinal): 20.19m / 9.37m/s ≈ 2.15s (Medium Risk)
- MDC: Considering the lateral movement away from the ego vehicle, MDC is likely > 3.38m (Low/Medium Risk).
- Overall Risk: Medium (3)

Obstacle 30241:
- Trajectory: Consistently to the left of the ego vehicle and slightly moving further left laterally.  Longitudinal distance remains at 0.00m, indicating alignment, not collision.
- At t=0.9s: Longitudinal distance = 0.00m, Lateral distance = 1.92m, Longitudinal velocity = -4.56m/s, Lateral velocity = 0.02 m/s.
- TTC (lateral):  Not applicable given divergence in lateral direction.
- MDC: 1.92m (Medium Risk)
- Overall Risk: Medium (3)

Obstacle 30242:
- Trajectory: Directly in front of the ego vehicle and approaching longitudinally. Lateral distance remains at 0.00m, confirming same lane.
- At t=0.9s: Longitudinal distance = 16.75m, Lateral distance = 0.00m, Longitudinal velocity = -6.88m/s, Lateral velocity = 0.26m/s.
- TTC (longitudinal): 16.75m / 6.88m/s ≈ 2.43s (Medium Risk)
- MDC: Primarily longitudinal, therefore close to longitudinal distance (Medium Risk).
- Overall Risk: Medium (3)

Obstacle 30243:
- Trajectory: Behind and to the left, moving away longitudinally but slightly approaching laterally.
- At t=0.9s: Longitudinal distance = -23.68m, Lateral distance = 2.24m, Longitudinal velocity = -2.30m/s, Lateral velocity = -1.12m/s.
- TTC (lateral): 2.24m/1.12m/s ≈ 2s (Medium Risk).
- MDC: Given the longitudinal divergence, MDC is likely > 2.24m. (Low/Medium risk)
- Overall Risk: Medium (3)

Obstacle 30249:
- Trajectory: Front-left, approaching longitudinally but moving away laterally.
- At t=0.9s: Longitudinal distance = 8.55m, Lateral distance = 2.39m, Longitudinal velocity = -6.33m/s, Lateral velocity = 0.21m/s.
- TTC (longitudinal): 8.55m / 6.33m/s ≈ 1.35s (Medium Risk)
- MDC: Given the lateral movement away, MDC is likely >2.39m (Low/Medium risk).
- Overall Risk: Medium (3)
