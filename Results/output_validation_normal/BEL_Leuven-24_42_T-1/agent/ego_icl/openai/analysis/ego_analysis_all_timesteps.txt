### Obstacle-by-Obstacle Analysis

**Obstacle 30238 (Front-left)**
- Adjusted longitudinal distance: 20.19 m
- Adjusted lateral distance: 3.38 m
- Longitudinal relative velocity: -9.37 m/s (approaching)
- Lateral relative velocity: 0.03 m/s (moving away laterally)
- **Analysis**: The obstacle is mainly aligned diagonally, moving closer longitudinally with a fast approach. Despite the lateral movement being away, the significant closing longitudinal distance and velocity are concerning.
- **TTC (longitudinal)**: 20.19 m / 9.37 m/s ≈ 2.15 s (Medium Risk)
- **MDC**: As the lateral distance is increasing, focus remains primarily on the longitudinal movement where the distance reduces prominently.
- **Risk Score**: 3 (Medium Risk)

**Obstacle 30241 (Left)**
- Adjusted longitudinal distance: 0.00 m (Exact alignment, side-by-side)
- Adjusted lateral distance: 1.92 m
- Longitudinal relative velocity: -4.56 m/s (approaching)
- Lateral relative velocity: 0.02 m/s (moving marginally)
- **Analysis**: This obstacle is in a stable alignment to the left with a slowly decreasing lateral distance and relatively stable with significant longitudinal alignment posing no immediate direct collision risk but needs monitoring.
- **TTC (lateral)**: 1.92 m / 0.02 m/s exceeds safe limits; hence deemed negligible.
- **Risk Score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)

**Obstacle 30242 (Front)**
- Adjusted longitudinal distance: 16.75 m
- Adjusted lateral distance: 0.00 m (Exact lateral alignment)
- Longitudinal relative velocity: -6.88 m/s (approaching rapidly)
- Lateral relative velocity: 0.26 m/s
- **Analysis**: Directly in frontal alignment, approaching quickly in the same lane, creating a potentially high-risk scenario due to decreasing longitudinal distance.
- **TTC (longitudinal)**: 16.75 m / 6.88 m/s ≈ 2.43 s (Medium Risk)
- **MDC**: Forward trajectory suggests a decreasing longitudinal path.
- **Risk Score**: 3 (Medium Risk)

**Obstacle 30243 (Rear-left)**
- Adjusted longitudinal distance: -23.68 m (Moving away)
- Adjusted lateral distance: 2.24 m
- Longitudinal relative velocity: -2.30 m/s
- Lateral relative velocity: -1.12 m/s (approaching towards lateral)
- **Analysis**: This obstacle is mainly moving away longitudinally but approaching from a lateral aspect towards the ego vehicle, with a decreasing lateral distance.
- **TTC (lateral)**: 2.24 m / 1.12 m/s ≈ 2.00 s (Medium Risk)
- **Risk Score**: 3 (Medium Risk)

**Obstacle 30249 (Front-left)**
- Adjusted longitudinal distance: 8.55 m (Decreasing)
- Adjusted lateral distance: 2.39 m
- Longitudinal relative velocity: -6.33 m/s (approaching)
- Lateral relative velocity: 0.21 m/s
- **Analysis**: Positioned diagonally, both longitudinal and lateral distances are decreasing. Approaching with a significant reduction, causing an elevated risk level.
- **TTC (longitudinal)**: 8.55 m / 6.33 m/s ≈ 1.35 s (Medium Risk)
- **MDC**: Decreasing towards a critical junction.
- **Risk Score**: 3 (Medium Risk)
