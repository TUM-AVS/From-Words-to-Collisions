At t=0.9s, Ego is in lanelet 116. Obstacle 30242 is also in lanelet 116 and is the closest obstacle to Ego.  Obstacle 30242's position is (252.5642, 269.8686) while Ego's is (265.9058, 253.2843). While the y-coordinates suggest a potential lane change by Obstacle 30242, the x-coordinate difference and the decelerating velocities of both Ego and Obstacle 30242 suggest a low risk of collision in the immediate next timestep.  All other obstacles are in lanelet 115 and pose negligible risk at this timestep given their current positions and velocities.
