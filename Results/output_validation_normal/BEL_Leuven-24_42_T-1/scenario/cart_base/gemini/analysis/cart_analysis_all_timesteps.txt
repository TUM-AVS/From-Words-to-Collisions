At t=0.9s, Ego is in lanelet 116. Obstacle 30242 is also in lanelet 116 and is the closest obstacle to Ego.  Obstacle 30242's x-coordinate (252.5642) is significantly behind Ego's (265.9058) and they are both moving in roughly the same direction (similar orientation). Although 30242's velocity is decreasing, it does not pose an immediate collision risk. Other obstacles are in lanelet 115, thus not an immediate risk.  Therefore, no obstacle presents a collision or extreme risk.
