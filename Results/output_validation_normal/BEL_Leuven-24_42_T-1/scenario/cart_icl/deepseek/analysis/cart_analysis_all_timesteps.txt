### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep (0.9 seconds):

### Obstacle Analysis:
1. **Obstacle ID: 30238.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Static or very slow-moving obstacle in a different lanelet (115.0). No immediate proximity to ego.
   - **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: Velocity is negligible (0.2605 m/s) and moving away.
   - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)

2. **Obstacle ID: 30241.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: In lanelet 115.0, moving parallel to ego but at a safe lateral distance (~1.5-2m).
   - **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: Decelerating (velocity: 5.0757 m/s, acceleration: -2.0997 m/s²). Relative velocity is moderate.
   - **Time safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 3 (Medium Risk)

3. **Obstacle ID: 30242.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: In the same lanelet (116.0) as ego but ahead (~13m longitudinal distance). 
   - **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: Decelerating (velocity: 2.7581 m/s, acceleration: -0.9019 m/s²). Ego is closing the gap but at a manageable rate.
   - **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low Risk)

4. **Obstacle ID: 30243.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: In lanelet 115.0, moving away from ego (~13m lateral distance).
   - **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: Velocity (7.4135 m/s) is higher than ego's, moving away.
   - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)

5. **Obstacle ID: 30249.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: In lanelet 115.0, moving parallel to ego at a safe lateral distance (~10m).
   - **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: Decelerating (velocity: 3.3092 m/s, acceleration: -2.1755 m/s²). Relative velocity is low.
   - **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low Risk)

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. No obstacles are in immediate collision path (distance and time metrics are safe).
2. Obstacle 30242.0 is in the same lanelet but far enough ahead to allow reaction time.
3. All other obstacles are in adjacent lanelets or moving away.
4. Ego is decelerating, reducing risk further.
