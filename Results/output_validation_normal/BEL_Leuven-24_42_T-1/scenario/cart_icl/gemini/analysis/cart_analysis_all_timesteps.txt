### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. The ego vehicle is in lanelet 116.
2. Obstacles in the same or adjacent lanelets (115, 116) are significantly far ahead or behind, posing no immediate threat.
3. Obstacles in other lanelets are spatially separated and exhibit trajectories that diverge from the ego vehicle's path.
4. Based on the provided data, no collisions are detected.
