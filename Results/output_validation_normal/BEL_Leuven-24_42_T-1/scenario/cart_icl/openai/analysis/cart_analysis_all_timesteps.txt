### Obstacle Analyses:

#### Obstacle 30221
- **Distance Risk reason**: Obstacle is in the same lanelet as the ego (lanelet 116), but it is stationary. The distance is sufficient and stable due to no movement over time.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: The obstacle has zero velocity and no acceleration. No risk of collision due to static nature.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

#### Obstacle 30239
- **Distance Risk reason**: Positioned in the same lanelet and showing patterns of decreasing velocity, which brings it closer to the ego vehicle over time.
- **Distance safety score**: 3
- **Time Risk reason**: Decreasing velocity indicates closing distance towards the ego, suggesting a possible future risk without corrective maneuvers.
- **Time safety score**: 3
- **Overall Risk score**: 3

#### Obstacle 30242
- **Distance Risk reason**: Obstacle in lanelet 116 is also approaching indicated by a slight decrease in position alignment with the lanelet's direction.
- **Distance safety score**: 4
- **Time Risk reason**: Steadily decreasing velocity over several timesteps indicates a consistent, albeit slow, approach.
- **Time safety score**: 4
- **Overall Risk score**: 4

#### Obstacle 30246
- **Distance Risk reason**: Moving away from the ego vehicle with adequate velocity in lanelet 116.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: Acceleration indicates it is speeding up and moving further away from the ego vehicle.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
The primary focus of concern is the obstacles in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle, notably 30221, which remains stationary and causes no risk. Objects like 30239 and 30242 exhibit movement patterns that are moderatively risky due to their existing trajectories and velocities heading towards the ego vehicle. However, none of them directly implies an imminent collision scenario because they are sufficiently distanced, and their speeds are manageable within current safety limits.
