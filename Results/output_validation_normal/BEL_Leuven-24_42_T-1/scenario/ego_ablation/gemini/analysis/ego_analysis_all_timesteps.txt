Obstacle 30249 is the highest risk obstacle, with a longitudinal distance of 8.55m and closing at -6.33 m/s.  It is predicted to be at 2.39m laterally (to the left) and moving away laterally at 0.21 m/s. While the lateral movement suggests decreasing lateral risk, the longitudinal velocity indicates a high risk of collision in the near future if the ego vehicle or obstacle 30249 does not decelerate or maneuver. Obstacle 30242 is also closing longitudinally, at -6.88 m/s, with a longitudinal distance of 16.75 m. While further away than 30249, it sits directly in front of the ego vehicle (0.00 m lateral distance) making it an obstacle of high concern as well.

  "ScenarioAnalysis": {
    "IsCollisionScenario": false,
    "Reasoning": "Obstacle 30249 poses an extreme risk with a high closing velocity and proximity in the front-left zone. While no immediate collision is detected, immediate action is required to avoid impact. Other obstacles, such as 30242, also require attention due to their longitudinal closing velocity."
