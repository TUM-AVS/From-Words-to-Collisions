At t=0.9s, obstacle 30249 is closest to the ego vehicle with a longitudinal distance of 8.55m and a lateral distance of 2.39m, and is approaching longitudinally at -6.33 m/s. While this represents a high risk, it doesn't represent an immediate collision or extreme risk in the next timestep as the obstacle is moving away laterally. No obstacle shows an immediate collision risk within the next timestep.

**Risk Levels and Definitions:**
<Collision (Score: 0)>: Actual collision has occurred or is unavoidable within the next timestep.
<Extreme Risk (Score: 1)>: Immediate collision or very high likelihood of impact. Urgent action is required.
<High Risk (Score: 2)>: Close to collision or highly probable collision path. Needs prompt attention and quick manoeuvring.
<Medium Risk (Score: 3)>: Moderate collision risk but manageable with timely reactions and proper strategies.
<Low Risk (Score: 4)>: Minimal collision risk. The situation is controllable with sufficient time to react.
<Negligible Risk (Score: 5)>: No significant collision risk. Obstacles are either moving away or far enough not to interfere.
