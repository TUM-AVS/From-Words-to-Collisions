### Safety analysis for timestep 0.9 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

**Missing Information:** The provided scenario lacks crucial information for accurate TTC and MDC calculation.  Specifically, it's missing the adjusted longitudinal and lateral distances (adjusted_d_long and adjusted_d_lat).  Without these adjusted distances, and without dimensions of the ego vehicle and obstacles, a precise safety assessment is impossible.  The analysis below will be qualitative based on the available information, highlighting the need for the missing data.

### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 30238**
    - Distance Risk reason: Located Front-Left with decreasing longitudinal distance (20.19m) and reasonably large lateral distance (20.19m) suggesting a potential risk if the lateral distance continues to decrease.
    - Distance safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
    - Time Risk reason:  Cannot calculate TTC without adjusted distances and velocities. The obstacle is moving towards the ego longitudinally (-9.37 m/s) but laterally away (0.03 m/s).  Risk assessment depends heavily on the actual trajectory and adjusted distances.
    - Time safety score: 3 (Medium Risk - assuming potential for lateral movement towards ego)
    - Overall Risk score: 3 (Medium Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 30241**
    - Distance Risk reason: Located to the Left with zero longitudinal and lateral distance. This either indicates an error or a very close proximity.  Requires adjusted distance for accurate assessment.
    - Distance safety score: 2 (High Risk - due to reported zero distance)
    - Time Risk reason: Moving away laterally (0.02 m/s), but the longitudinal velocity (-4.56 m/s) suggests potential for collision if not perfectly aligned. TTC calculation impossible without adjusted distances.
    - Time safety score: 2 (High Risk - Potential for longitudinal collision)
    - Overall Risk score: 2 (High Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 30242**
    - Distance Risk reason:  Located in Front with decreasing longitudinal distance (16.75 m) and lateral distance (16.75 m) indicating a potential risk if the lateral distance doesn't increase sufficiently.
    - Distance safety score: 3 (Medium Risk)
    - Time Risk reason: Moving towards the ego longitudinally (-6.88 m/s), with minimal lateral movement (0.26 m/s). TTC calculation impossible without adjusted distances.
    - Time safety score: 2 (High Risk - due to closing longitudinal distance)
    - Overall Risk score: 2 (High Risk)


- **Obstacle ID: 30243**
    - Distance Risk reason:  Located Rear-Left and moving away longitudinally (-23.68m). Lateral distance (-23.68m) is significant but decreasing, suggesting the obstacle might move closer laterally in the future.
    - Distance safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
    - Time Risk reason:  Moving away longitudinally (-2.30 m/s) but towards the ego laterally (-1.12 m/s).  Risk is low for now but requires monitoring. TTC calculation impossible without adjusted distances.
    - Time safety score: 3 (Medium Risk)
    - Overall Risk score: 3 (Medium Risk)


- **Obstacle ID: 30249**
    - Distance Risk reason: Located Front-Left, with rapidly decreasing longitudinal distance (8.55 m) and lateral distance (8.55 m). This obstacle poses the highest immediate risk.
    - Distance safety score: 2 (High Risk)
    - Time Risk reason:  Moving towards the ego both longitudinally (-6.33 m/s) and slightly laterally (0.21 m/s), but lateral movement is away from ego. TTC calculation is crucial here but impossible with the provided data.
    - Time safety score: 1 (Extreme Risk - Due to the short distance and closing speed)
    - Overall Risk score: 1 (Extreme Risk)


### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
  "CollisionObstacle": null,
  "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {
    "ObstacleID": "30249",
    "OverallRiskScore": "1"
  },
  "IsCollisionScenario": false, 
  "Justification": "Obstacle 30249 presents an extreme risk due to its close proximity, high closing speed, and front-left position relative to the ego vehicle. While not a guaranteed collision yet (hence IsCollisionScenario: false), it is the most critical obstacle requiring immediate attention. Precise risk assessment and collision prediction are hampered by the lack of adjusted distances (adjusted_d_long and adjusted_d_lat) in the provided data."
