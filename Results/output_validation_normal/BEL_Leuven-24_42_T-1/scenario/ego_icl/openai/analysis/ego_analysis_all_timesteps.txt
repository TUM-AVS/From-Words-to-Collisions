### Obstacle-by-Obstacle Analysis:

#### Obstacle 30238:
- **Relative Direction**: Front-left
- **Adjusted Distance**: Longitudinal: 20.19m, Lateral: 3.38m
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal: -9.37 m/s, Lateral: 0.03 m/s
- **Trajectory**: Driving toward the ego vehicle longitudinally and moving away laterally
- **TTC Calculation**:
  - Longitudinal TTC = 20.19 / 9.37 ≈ 2.15 seconds
  - Lateral movement does not affect increasing collision risk
- **MDC Calculation**: Trajectory and distance suggest paths do not converge imminently.
- **Risk Assessment**: Medium Risk (3), as TTC longitudinally is below 3 seconds.

#### Obstacle 30241:
- **Relative Direction**: Left
- **Adjusted Distance**: Longitudinal: 0.00m, Lateral: 1.92m
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal: -4.56 m/s, Lateral: 0.02 m/s
- **Trajectory**: Exact longitudinal alignment and moving away laterally
- **TTC Calculation**:
  - Movement laterally is towards the ego, but negligible change is observed (0.02 m/s).
- **MDC Calculation**: Since lateral position is already established at 1.92m and moving away, this supports no imminent collision.
- **Risk Assessment**: Medium Risk (3), as lateral movement is minimal and increasing distance.

#### Obstacle 30242:
- **Relative Direction**: Front
- **Adjusted Distance**: Longitudinal: 16.75m, Lateral: 0.00m
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal: -6.88 m/s, Lateral: 0.26 m/s
- **Trajectory**: Driving toward the ego vehicle longitudinally
- **TTC Calculation**:
  - Longitudinal TTC = 16.75 / 6.88 ≈ 2.43 seconds
- **MDC Calculation**: Exact lateral alignment with decreasing longitudinal distance
- **Risk Assessment**: Medium Risk (3), as the trajectory suggests continued approach within medium risk parameters.

#### Obstacle 30243:
- **Relative Direction**: Rear-left
- **Adjusted Distance**: Longitudinal: -23.68m, Lateral: 2.24m
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal: -2.30 m/s, Lateral: -1.12 m/s
- **Trajectory**: Moving away longitudinally, driving toward the ego vehicle laterally
- **TTC Calculation**:
  - Lateral TTC = 2.24 / 1.12 = 2.00 seconds
- **MDC Calculation**: Lateral risk is increasing due to converging trajectory.
- **Risk Assessment**: Medium Risk (3), lateral approach to the ego vehicle within medium parameters.

#### Obstacle 30249:
- **Relative Direction**: Front-left
- **Adjusted Distance**: Longitudinal: 8.55m, Lateral: 2.39m
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal: -6.33 m/s, Lateral: 0.21 m/s
- **Trajectory**: Driving toward the ego vehicle longitudinally
- **TTC Calculation**:
  - Longitudinal TTC = 8.55 / 6.33 ≈ 1.35 seconds
- **MDC Calculation**: Potential for early collision avoidance, but still within high-risk proximity.
- **Risk Assessment**: Medium Risk (3), since it is still approaching but beyond imminent threat parameters.

### Determination:
- No obstacles score an overall risk score of 0 (collision) or 1 (Extreme Risk) in the most recent timestep.
- 30238 and 30249 approach medium TTC values but do not pose an immediate collision risk.
