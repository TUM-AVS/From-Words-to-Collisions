Obstacle 30241 is in the same lanelet (115) as the ego vehicle and initially positioned slightly ahead and to the right.  Over the time steps, this obstacle's y-coordinate increases, suggesting it's moving closer to the ego vehicle's y-coordinate. Additionally, obstacle 30241's x-coordinate decreases, indicating movement towards the ego vehicle's x-coordinate. While both vehicles are decelerating, the closing distance combined with the lane sharing makes this a potential high risk.

Obstacle 30238 is also in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle and is positioned significantly behind. The obstacle is moving slowly and decelerating significantly, suggesting a low risk of collision.

Obstacle 30229 is far behind the ego vehicle and moving very slowly. It poses a negligible risk.

Obstacles 30239, 30242, and 30245 are in a different lanelet (116) and while their trajectories might bring them closer to the ego vehicle, they don't present an immediate risk based on the provided data.
