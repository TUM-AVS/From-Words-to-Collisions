Here's the analysis and the JSON output:

**Analysis:**

The Ego vehicle (30249.0) is in lanelet 115.0 for the duration of this timeframe.  Several obstacles are present, some in the same lanelet and others in lanelet 116.0.  Let's consider the most relevant ones:

* **Obstacle 30241.0:** This obstacle is in the same lanelet (115.0) as the Ego vehicle and initially has a higher velocity.  However, its velocity is decreasing significantly over the time steps, while it moves closer to the Ego vehicle. This suggests a high risk of collision if this trend continues.

* **Obstacle 30238.0:** Also in the same lanelet as the Ego vehicle and appears to be slowing down.  It is quite close to the Ego vehicle initially and its relatively low velocity suggests that a collision might be possible if both vehicles maintain their current trajectories and decelerations.  

* **Obstacles 30239.0 and 30242.0:** These are in lanelet 116.  While 30239 slows, both don't pose an immediate threat unless there's a lane change by either the Ego vehicle or the obstacles.

* **Obstacle 30245.0:** In lanelet 116 and moving with a higher velocity than the Ego vehicle, but remains in a different lanelet and appears to be moving away from the Ego Vehicle.

* **Obstacle 30229.0:** In the same lanelet as Ego and moves very slowly, appears to pose no immediate threat.


Based on the provided data, Obstacle 30241 represents a High Risk as it is in the same lane, approaching the Ego vehicle, and its behavior (decelerating) is concerning. Obstacle 30238 also represents a High Risk as its proximity combined with decreasing velocity suggests a potential collision.  There are no imminent collisions or extreme risk obstacles identifiable within the 0.9-second timeframe.
