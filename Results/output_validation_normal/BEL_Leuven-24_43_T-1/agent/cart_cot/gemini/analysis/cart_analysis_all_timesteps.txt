At t=0.9s, the ego vehicle is at (257.57, 258.34) with a velocity of 6.84 and orientation 2.23 radians. We will analyze each obstacle individually, focusing on the last provided timestep (t=0.9s) and using previous data to inform our risk assessment.  Lanelet information is also considered, as vehicles in different lanelets may pose less risk even if physically proximate.

* **Obstacle 30229:** Located at (242.14, 275.99) in lanelet 115, velocity 0.11, orientation -3.93 radians. This obstacle is far from the ego vehicle and moving slowly.  **Risk Score: 5 (Negligible Risk)**

* **Obstacle 30238:** Located at (247.70, 270.04) in lanelet 115, velocity 0.63, orientation 2.31 radians.  This obstacle is also relatively far from the ego vehicle. **Risk Score: 5 (Negligible Risk)**

* **Obstacle 30239:** Located at (246.44, 276.57) in lanelet 116, velocity 2.35, orientation 2.33 radians. Although this obstacle is in a different lanelet, it's important to monitor its trajectory in case of lane changes. Currently, it poses no immediate threat. **Risk Score: 5 (Negligible Risk)**

* **Obstacle 30241:** Located at (267.37, 245.23) in lanelet 115, velocity 6.84, orientation 2.19 radians. This obstacle is the closest to the ego vehicle and in the same lanelet.  The similar velocities and the decelerations suggest potential risk if the deceleration of the ego vehicle is greater than that of this obstacle vehicle. Close monitoring is necessary.  **Risk Score: 3 (Medium Risk)**

* **Obstacle 30242:** Located at (255.00, 267.01) in lanelet 116, velocity 4.18, orientation 2.27 radians. This obstacle is in a different lanelet, and its trajectory suggests no immediate danger. **Risk Score: 4 (Low Risk)**

* **Obstacle 30245:** Located at (272.48, 243.99) in lanelet 116, velocity 10.72, orientation 2.15 radians.  This obstacle is relatively close to the ego vehicle in terms of Y coordinate but significantly ahead in the X coordinate in a different lanelet. It is moving quickly, but due to its position and lanelet, the risk is low. **Risk Score: 4 (Low Risk)**
