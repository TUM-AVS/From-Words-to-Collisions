At t=0.9s, the ego vehicle is in lanelet 115 with a decreasing velocity. Let's analyze the obstacles:

* **Obstacle 30229:** Far behind the ego vehicle and moving slowly. Negligible risk.
* **Obstacle 30238:** Behind the ego vehicle and in the same lanelet, but slowing down significantly. Low risk.
* **Obstacle 30239:** In the adjacent lanelet (116) and further away laterally than at t=0.8s. Medium risk.
* **Obstacle 30241:** Behind the ego in the same lanelet, and decelerating faster than the ego vehicle. Requires monitoring but currently low risk.
* **Obstacle 30242:** In the adjacent lanelet and moving slower than the ego vehicle. Medium risk due to proximity, but lateral separation is improving.
* **Obstacle 30245:**  Located in lanelet 116. This obstacle is significantly ahead of the ego vehicle and poses no immediate risk.
