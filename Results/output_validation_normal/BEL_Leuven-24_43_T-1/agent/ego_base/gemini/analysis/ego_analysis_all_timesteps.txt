Obstacle 30242 is at high risk. It is only 3.92 meters in front of the ego vehicle and 1.66 meters to the right, closing at -2.66 m/s longitudinally and 0.17 m/s laterally.  While the lateral velocity suggests it might be moving away from a direct collision path, the close proximity and longitudinal closing speed represent a significant and immediate danger.
