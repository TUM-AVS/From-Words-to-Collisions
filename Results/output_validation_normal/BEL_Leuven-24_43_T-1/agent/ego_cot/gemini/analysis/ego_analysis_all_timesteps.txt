### Safety analysis for timestep 0.9s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

**Assumptions and Clarifications:**

* The prompt mentions "adjusted distances" but doesn't provide them.  I will perform the analysis using the provided real distances (DTClong, DTClat).  The analysis would be more accurate with adjusted values.
* I'm assuming a collision occurs if DTClong or DTClat reaches 0.
*  A simple TTC calculation is used: `TTC = Distance / Relative Velocity`.  This doesn't account for acceleration, which is important for a complete analysis.
* I will define thresholds for TTC and MDC to assign risk scores. Since no specific thresholds are provided, I will use reasonable values.


**TTC and MDC Thresholds (Illustrative):**

* **TTC:**
    * 0-1s: Extreme Risk
    * 1-2s: High Risk
    * 2-3s: Medium Risk
    * 3-4s: Low Risk
    * >4s: Negligible Risk
* **MDC:**
    * 0-2m: Extreme Risk
    * 2-4m: High Risk
    * 4-6m: Medium Risk
    * 6-8m: Low Risk
    * >8m: Negligible Risk
