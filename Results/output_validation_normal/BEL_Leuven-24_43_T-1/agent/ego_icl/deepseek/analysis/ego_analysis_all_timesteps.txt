Let me analyze each obstacle at the most recent timestep (0.9 seconds) with trajectory context:

1. Obstacle 30229 (Front):
   - Adjusted distance: longitudinal 18.89m, lateral 0.00m
   - Velocity: longitudinal -6.73 m/s (approaching), lateral 0.01 m/s (minimal)
   - TTC: 18.89/6.73 = 2.81s (Medium Risk)
   - MDC: 0.00m lateral but stable (No Risk)
   - Overall: Medium Risk (3) - approaching but sufficient time to react

2. Obstacle 30238 (Front):
   - Adjusted distance: longitudinal 10.79m, lateral 0.00m
   - Velocity: longitudinal -6.21 m/s (approaching), lateral 0.05 m/s (minimal)
   - TTC: 10.79/6.21 = 1.74s (Medium Risk)
   - MDC: 0.00m lateral but stable (No Risk)
   - Overall: Medium Risk (3) - closer than 30229 but still manageable

3. Obstacle 30239 (Front-right):
   - Adjusted distance: longitudinal 16.73m, lateral -0.74m
   - Velocity: longitudinal -4.50 m/s, lateral 0.24 m/s (both approaching)
   - TTC (longitudinal): 16.73/4.50 = 3.72s (Low Risk)
   - TTC (lateral): 0.74/0.24 = 3.08s (Medium Risk)
   - MDC: 0.74m lateral (High Risk threshold)
   - Overall: Medium Risk (3) - diagonal approach but sufficient distance

4. Obstacle 30241 (Behind):
   - Adjusted distance: longitudinal -11.86m, lateral 0.00m
   - Velocity: longitudinal -0.01 m/s (moving away), lateral -0.28 m/s
   - TTC: N/A (diverging paths)
   - MDC: 0.00m lateral but stable (No Risk)
   - Overall: No Risk (5) - moving away from ego

5. Obstacle 30242 (Front-right):
   - Adjusted distance: longitudinal 3.92m, lateral -1.66m
   - Velocity: longitudinal -2.66 m/s, lateral 0.17 m/s (both approaching)
   - TTC (longitudinal): 3.92/2.66 = 1.47s (Medium Risk)
   - TTC (lateral): 1.66/0.17 = 9.76s (No Risk)
   - MDC: 1.66m lateral (High Risk threshold)
   - Overall: Medium Risk (3) - closest front obstacle but lateral distance provides buffer

6. Obstacle 30245 (Rear-right):
   - Adjusted distance: longitudinal -15.96m, lateral -1.42m
   - Velocity: longitudinal 3.85 m/s (approaching), lateral -0.83 m/s (moving away)
   - TTC: N/A (lateral divergence)
   - MDC: 1.42m lateral (High Risk threshold)
   - Overall: Low Risk (4) - approaching from behind but lateral separation increasing

Analysis:
- No collisions (0) or extreme risks (1) detected
- Highest risk is Medium (3) from obstacles 30238 and 30242
- All obstacles have sufficient time/distance for safe reaction
- Closest obstacle (30242 at 3.92m front-right) has stable lateral separation
- Rear obstacles are either moving away or have increasing lateral distance
