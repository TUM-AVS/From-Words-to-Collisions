**Obstacle 30229:**
- **Trajectory and Motion**: Front of the ego car, longitudinal distance decreasing significantly, lateral alignment with no lateral movement.
- **Distance at 0.9s**: Longitudinal 18.89 m, Lateral 0.00 m
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal -6.73 m/s, Lateral 0.01 m/s
- **TTC Calculation**: Longitudinal TTC = 18.89 m / 6.73 m/s ≈ 2.81 s; Lateral movement is negligible, so disregarded.
- **MDC**: Primarily based on longitudinal; with ongoing alignment and decreasing distance, MDC is significantly reduced.
- **Risk Assessment**: Medium risk (Score 3) due to TTC of 2.81 seconds.

**Obstacle 30238:**
- **Trajectory and Motion**: Directly in front, with rapidly decreasing longitudinal distance, no lateral displacement.
- **Distance at 0.9s**: Longitudinal 10.79 m, Lateral 0.00 m
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal -6.21 m/s, Lateral 0.05 m/s
- **TTC Calculation**: Longitudinal TTC = 10.79 m / 6.21 m/s ≈ 1.74 s; Lateral movement is negligible.
- **MDC**: Similar assessment as for 30229, but closer and faster closing.
- **Risk Assessment**: Medium risk (Score 3) because TTC is still above 1 second.

**Obstacle 30239:**
- **Trajectory and Motion**: Front-right, decreasing longitudinal and approaching lateral distance.
- **Distance at 0.9s**: Longitudinal 16.73 m, Lateral -0.74 m
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal -4.50 m/s, Lateral 0.24 m/s
- **TTC Calculation**: Both dimensions must be considered; Longitudinal TTC = 16.73 m / 4.50 m/s ≈ 3.72 s; Lateral TTC = 0.74 m / 0.24 m/s ≈ 3.08 s
- **MDC**: Crucially dependent on lateral closing, making it the primary for consideration.
- **Risk Assessment**: Medium risk (Score 3), the risk lies more in lateral movement.

**Obstacle 30241:**
- **Trajectory and Motion**: Behind, with stable/slow closing longitudinal alignment.
- **Distance at 0.9s**: Longitudinal -11.86 m, Lateral 0.00 m
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal -0.01 m/s, Lateral -0.28 m/s
- **TTC and MDC**: Longitudinal distance is increasing, not applicable.
- **Risk Assessment**: No Risk (Score 5) since still behind and safe.

**Obstacle 30242:**
- **Trajectory and Motion**: Front-right, significantly decreasing distance in both dimensions.
- **Distance at 0.9s**: Longitudinal 3.92 m, Lateral -1.66 m
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal -2.66 m/s, Lateral 0.17 m/s
- **TTC Calculation**: Longitudinal TTC = 3.92 m / 2.66 m/s ≈ 1.47 s; Lateral TTC is less impactful.
- **MDC**: Significant as both dimensions see closing movement.
- **Risk Assessment**: Medium Risk (Score 3), due to longitudinal proximity.

**Obstacle 30245:**
- **Trajectory and Motion**: Rear-right, maintaining distance, moving away laterally.
- **Distance at 0.9s**: Longitudinal -15.96 m, Lateral -1.42 m
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal 3.85 m/s, Lateral -0.83 m/s
- **TTC and MDC**: Negative or increasing relative distances indicate no current risk.
- **Risk Assessment**: No Risk (Score 5), moving safely away.
