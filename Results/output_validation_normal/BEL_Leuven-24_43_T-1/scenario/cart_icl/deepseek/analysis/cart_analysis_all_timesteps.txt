### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep (0.9 seconds):

### Obstacle Analysis:

1. **Obstacle ID: 30229.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Static or very slow-moving (velocity ~0.1 m/s), located behind ego in the same lanelet (115.0). Distance increasing over time.
   - **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: Relative velocity is negative (ego moving away). No collision risk.
   - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 5

2. **Obstacle ID: 30238.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Moving slowly (velocity ~0.63 m/s) in same lanelet (115.0), but distance from ego is increasing.
   - **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: Relative velocity is negative (ego moving away faster). Decelerating.
   - **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 4

3. **Obstacle ID: 30239.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: In adjacent lanelet (116.0), moving towards ego's path (orientation similar). Distance decreasing but still significant.
   - **Distance safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: Decelerating (acceleration ~-1.7 m/s²), but still closing distance.
   - **Time safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 3

4. **Obstacle ID: 30241.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: In same lanelet (115.0), ahead of ego but moving away (relative velocity negative).
   - **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: Decelerating but still moving away from ego.
   - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 5

5. **Obstacle ID: 30242.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: In adjacent lanelet (116.0), moving parallel to ego. Distance decreasing slightly.
   - **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: Decelerating (acceleration ~-2.09 m/s²), relative velocity low.
   - **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 4

6. **Obstacle ID: 30245.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: In adjacent lanelet (116.0), moving fast but away from ego's path.
   - **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: High speed but moving away (orientation diverging).
   - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 5

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. No obstacles are in immediate collision path (all distances > safe threshold).
2. Obstacle 30239.0 shows moderate risk due to potential lane crossing, but current trajectory suggests safe passage.
3. All other obstacles are either moving away or in non-conflicting paths.
4. Ego vehicle is decelerating, providing additional safety margin.
