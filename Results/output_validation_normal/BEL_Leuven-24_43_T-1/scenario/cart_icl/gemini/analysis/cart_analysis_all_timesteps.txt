### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
Based on the provided data, this is not a collision scenario. No obstacles are on a direct collision course with the ego vehicle within the observed timeframe. The ego vehicle maintains a safe distance from other vehicles in its lanelet and other obstacles are in different lanelets or moving away.

### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
  "CollisionObstacles": null,
  "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null,
  "ScenarioAnalysis": {
    "IsCollisionScenario": false,
    "Reasoning": "No obstacle is predicted to collide with the ego vehicle based on their current trajectories and velocities."
  }
