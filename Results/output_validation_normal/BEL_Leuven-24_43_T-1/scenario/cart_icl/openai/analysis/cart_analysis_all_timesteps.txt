### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: 
Here is the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

1. **Obstacle ID: 30220.0**
   - Distance Risk reason: Stationary and not in the same trajectory as the ego vehicle.
   - Distance safety score: 5
   - Time Risk reason: No relative velocity; it is stationary.
   - Time safety score: 5
   - Overall Risk score: 5

2. **Obstacle ID: 30221.0**
   - Distance Risk reason: Stationary and not directly along the ego's path.
   - Distance safety score: 5
   - Time Risk reason: No velocity; not moving closer to ego.
   - Time safety score: 5
   - Overall Risk score: 5

3. **Obstacle ID: 30230.0**
   - Distance Risk reason: Stationary with minor movement not affecting the ego's trajectory.
   - Distance safety score: 5
   - Time Risk reason: No significant velocity changes affecting the ego.
   - Time safety score: 5
   - Overall Risk score: 5

4. **Obstacle ID: 30225.0**
   - Distance Risk reason: Moving parallel but maintaining a safe distance across lanes.
   - Distance safety score: 4
   - Time Risk reason: Consistent velocity, no sudden changes towards the ego.
   - Time safety score: 5
   - Overall Risk score: 4

5. **Obstacle ID: 30226.0**
   - Distance Risk reason: Parallel trajectory, maintaining separation in a different lanelet.
   - Distance safety score: 4
   - Time Risk reason: Velocity does not pose a threat to the ego vehicle's path.
   - Time safety score: 5
   - Overall Risk score: 4

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
Upon evaluating the distance and velocity parameters of each obstacle, it appears this is not a collision scenario. The obstacles are either stationary, on parallel paths not intersecting the ego vehicle's lanelet, or maintaining a safe separation throughout their trajectories. The primary factors considered included relative positioning, velocity trends, and the absence of intersecting paths.

### Summary in JSON Format:
No collisions or extreme risks have been identified in this scenario.
