Obstacle 30242 is the highest risk obstacle. At 0.9 seconds, it is only 3.92 meters in front and 1.66 meters to the right of the ego vehicle, closing at a relative longitudinal speed of -2.66 m/s.  Although the lateral velocity suggests it is moving slightly towards the ego vehicle (0.17 m/s), the negative lateral distance and ongoing longitudinal closure represent a very serious and immediate collision risk.
