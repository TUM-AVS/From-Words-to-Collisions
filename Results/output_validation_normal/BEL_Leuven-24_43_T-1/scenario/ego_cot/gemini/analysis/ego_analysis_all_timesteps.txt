### Safety analysis for timestep 0.9 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

**Assumptions and Clarifications:**

* The prompt mentions "adjusted distances" (adjusted_d_long and adjusted_d_lat), but these values are not provided in the scenario context.  Therefore, I will use the provided "real distance" (DTClong and DTClat) values for this analysis.  However, in a real-world application, adjusted distances should be used for a more accurate assessment.
* I will estimate TTC (Time to Collision) using a simplified approach: TTC = Distance / Relative Velocity. This assumes constant velocity, which isn't always true, but is sufficient for a basic assessment given the data available.
* I will determine MDC (Minimum Distance to Collision) based on the closest approach observed within the provided time window.
* As lateral and longitudinal information and their corresponding TTC and MDC are not provided, I will make a combined risk assessment from the available data and direction of travel.
* Risk scores are assigned considering both TTC and MDC, weighted towards TTC as it is a more dynamic measure of risk.


### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 30229**
- Distance Risk reason:  Located at 18.89m longitudinally and 18.89m laterally in front, and moving towards the ego vehicle longitudinally.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Closing longitudinally at -6.73 m/s, implies a TTC of roughly 2.8 seconds. Lateral movement minimal.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3

- **Obstacle ID: 30238**
- Distance Risk reason: Located 10.79m longitudinally and 10.79m laterally in front, moving towards the ego vehicle longitudinally.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: Closing longitudinally at -6.21 m/s, implies a TTC of roughly 1.7 seconds. Lateral movement minimal.
- Time safety score: 2
- Overall Risk score: 2

- **Obstacle ID: 30239**
- Distance Risk reason: Located 16.73m longitudinally and 16.73m laterally to the front-right, moving towards the ego vehicle both longitudinally and laterally.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Closing longitudinally at -4.50 m/s, implies a TTC of roughly 3.7 seconds. Lateral closing speed low.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3

- **Obstacle ID: 30241**
- Distance Risk reason: Located -11.86m longitudinally (behind) and -11.86m laterally, and slightly moving away longitudinally.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Slightly moving away longitudinally at -0.01m/s. Lateral movement not significant.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 30242**
- Distance Risk reason:  Located only 3.92m longitudinally and 3.92m laterally to the front-right. This is very close.  Moving towards the ego vehicle both longitudinally and laterally.
- Distance safety score: 1
- Time Risk reason: Closing longitudinally at -2.66 m/s, implies a TTC of roughly 1.5 seconds.  Lateral closing speed low.
- Time safety score: 2
- Overall Risk score: 1

- **Obstacle ID: 30245**
- Distance Risk reason: Located -15.96m longitudinally (behind) and -15.96m laterally to the rear-right, moving closer from behind but moving away laterally.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Approaching from behind at 3.85 m/s, but lateral movement is diverging.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

{
  "CollisionObstacle": null,
  "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {
    "ObstacleID": "30242",
    "OverallRiskScore": "1"
  },
  "IsCollisionScenario": false,
  "Justification": "Obstacle 30242 poses an extreme risk with a very close proximity and a low TTC, requiring immediate attention. While no immediate collision is predicted within the provided timeframe, the situation is critical and warrants evasive action."
