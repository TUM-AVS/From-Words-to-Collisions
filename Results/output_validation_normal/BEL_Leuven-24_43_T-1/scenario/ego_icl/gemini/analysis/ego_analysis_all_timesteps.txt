* **Obstacle 30229 (Front):** This obstacle has been consistently in front of the ego vehicle and moving closer longitudinally across all timesteps.  At the last timestep (0.9s), the longitudinal distance is 18.89m with a negative relative longitudinal velocity (-6.73 m/s) indicating continued approach.  Lateral distance is 0.00m (exact alignment) but the lateral velocity is minimal (0.01m/s). The consistent longitudinal approach suggests a potential future collision risk.

    * **TTC (longitudinal):** 18.89m / 6.73m/s ≈ 2.81s (Medium Risk)
    * **MDC:**  Not applicable due to alignment; considering longitudinal trajectory and velocity, potential risk remains.
    * **Overall Risk:** Medium (3)

* **Obstacle 30238 (Front):** This obstacle is directly in front of the ego vehicle (lateral distance = 0.00m) and approaching longitudinally across all timesteps.  At the last timestep (0.9s), the longitudinal distance is 10.79m and closing at -6.21m/s.

    * **TTC (longitudinal):** 10.79m / 6.21m/s ≈ 1.74s (Medium Risk)
    * **MDC:** Not applicable due to alignment; considering longitudinal trajectory and velocity, risk is elevated.
    * **Overall Risk:** Medium (3)

* **Obstacle 30239 (Front-Right):**  This obstacle is approaching both longitudinally and laterally. At 0.9s, it's 16.73m ahead longitudinally and 0.74m to the right laterally.  The lateral distance is decreasing across time steps, but slowly.

    * **TTC (longitudinal):** 16.73m / 4.50m/s ≈ 3.72s (Low Risk)
    * **TTC (lateral):** 0.74m / 0.24m/s ≈ 3.08s (Medium Risk)
    * **MDC:** Approximately 0.74m (High Risk).
    * **Overall Risk:** Medium (3) - Prioritizing MDC

* **Obstacle 30241 (Behind):**  This obstacle is behind the ego vehicle and has been fluctuating near 0m/s in terms of longitudinal relative velocity. Although it moves slightly closer and further from the ego vehicle over the timesteps, it's not on a direct collision course at the final timestep.

    * **TTC (longitudinal):** Not applicable due to negative relative velocity and not closing.
    * **MDC:** Not applicable; longitudinal motion is the primary factor, and it's not closing.
    * **Overall Risk:** No Risk (5)

* **Obstacle 30242 (Front-Right):**  This obstacle presents the most significant risk. It is approaching both longitudinally (3.92m) and laterally (-1.66m at 0.9s). Both distances are decreasing consistently across timesteps.

    * **TTC (longitudinal):** 3.92m / 2.66m/s ≈ 1.47s (Medium Risk)
    * **TTC (lateral):** 1.66m / 0.17m/s ≈ 9.76s (No Risk)
    * **MDC:** 1.66m (Medium Risk) - Lateral distance is the primary concern here, despite negative lateral distance (to the right).
    * **Overall Risk:** Medium (3)

* **Obstacle 30245 (Rear-Right):**  This obstacle is behind and to the right, and although the longitudinal distance is decreasing, indicating it's getting closer, the lateral distance is increasing.  It poses no immediate collision risk.

    * **TTC (longitudinal):** Not applicable due to slightly positive velocity, but not closing rapidly enough.
    * **MDC:** Not applicable, trajectory moving away laterally.
    * **Overall Risk:** No Risk (5)

**Collision Scenario Determination:**

No obstacle has a risk score of 0 (Collision) or 1 (Extreme Risk).  Therefore, this is NOT currently a collision scenario. However, obstacle 30242 requires close monitoring due to its proximity and closing trajectory.

**JSON Summary:**

```json
{
  "CollisionObstacle": {},
  "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {},
  "IsCollisionScenario": false,
  "Justification": "No obstacle has a Collision or Extreme Risk score. Closest obstacle (30242) is at a Medium Risk level, requiring monitoring but not currently constituting a collision scenario."
