Obstacle 30296 is consistently in the same lanelet (181) as the ego vehicle from timestep 0.4 seconds onwards. Initially, its y-coordinate is significantly lower than the ego vehicle, but it's approaching rapidly with a higher velocity.  Although both share lanelet 181 in the later time steps, between 0.4s and 0.9s, the y-coordinate difference decreases substantially. At 0.4s, the difference is approximately 14 meters, decreasing to roughly 16 meters at 0.9 seconds. Given the closing velocities and shared lanelet, this presents a high risk of collision. By 0.9 seconds, obstacle 30296 has moved to a different lanelet (875), reducing the immediate risk.
