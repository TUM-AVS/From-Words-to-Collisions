At t=0.9s, the ego vehicle is at (-153.9606, -141.0077) in lanelet 181. Let's analyze the risk posed by each obstacle:

* **Obstacle 30290:** Stationary and far from the ego vehicle's trajectory. Negligible risk.
* **Obstacle 30291:** Stationary and far from the ego vehicle's trajectory. Negligible risk.
* **Obstacle 30294:** Located at (-154.8783, -129.0501) and moving with a velocity of 1.073.  Given its position and the ego vehicle's trajectory, there is no immediate risk.  Lateral distance is sufficient. Low risk.
* **Obstacle 30295:** Located at (-163.6863, -123.6693).  Relatively far and poses no immediate threat to the ego vehicle. Low risk.
* **Obstacle 30296:** Located at (-160.2518, -156.8482) in lanelet 875. This obstacle shares the same general Y-coordinate as the ego vehicle, meaning they could potentially meet. Its x-coordinate is greater than the ego vehicle, which normally would mean that it's in front of the ego vehicle in this lane. However, the ego and obstacle 30296 are now in different lanelets, so collision is highly improbable. Low risk.
