At t=0.9s, obstacle 30294 poses a high risk. It is only 3.66 meters to the right and slightly behind the ego vehicle, moving laterally towards the ego at 1.04 m/s while moving longitudinally away at -9.35 m/s. Although it's moving away longitudinally, the lateral movement and close proximity represent a significant collision risk in the immediate future if the ego vehicle doesn't react or if obstacle 30294 continues its lateral movement.  No other obstacles pose an immediate collision risk.
