### Safety analysis for timestep 0.9s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

**Assumptions and Clarifications:**

* Since "adjusted distances" are explicitly requested but not provided in the scenario context, the provided real longitudinal and lateral distances (DTClong, DTClat) will be used directly for this analysis.  In a real-world application, you would substitute the adjusted values here.
* TTC calculations will be simplified due to the lack of adjusted distances. A proper TTC calculation requires accurate distance and velocity projections, which aren't fully possible with the given data.  The analysis will therefore focus on the qualitative assessment of risk based on observed distances, velocities, and motion descriptions.
* No vehicle dimensions are provided, making precise collision assessment difficult.  The analysis will assume a safety buffer around each vehicle.

### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 30290**
- Distance Risk reason:  Located at 17.64m longitudinally and laterally in the front-left. No immediate risk.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Approaching longitudinally at -9.62 m/s but still relatively far.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3

- **Obstacle ID: 30291**
- Distance Risk reason:  Similar to 30290, located at 17.54m longitudinally and laterally in front-left.  No immediate risk.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Approaching longitudinally at -9.62 m/s, also moving slightly towards the ego laterally.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3


- **Obstacle ID: 30294**
- Distance Risk reason: Behind the ego vehicle (-6.27m longitudinally) and to the right. Moving away longitudinally but slightly towards the ego laterally.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: The longitudinal movement away mitigates risk, but the lateral movement needs monitoring.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 30295**
- Distance Risk reason:  Behind the ego vehicle (-8.01m longitudinally) and to the right. Moving away longitudinally.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: The longitudinal movement away mitigates risk. The lateral velocity is also decreasing.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 30296**
- Distance Risk reason:  In front of the ego vehicle (12.54m longitudinally) and to the side. Moving slightly away longitudinally.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Minimal longitudinal relative velocity.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4
