At t=0.9s:

* **Obstacle 30290:** Front-left, longitudinal 17.64m, lateral 4.27m. Relative velocity: longitudinal -9.62 m/s, lateral -0.00 m/s.

    * Trajectory: Consistently front-left, gradually approaching in longitudinal direction, lateral distance stable. No immediate risk observed in the provided timesteps.

    * TTC (longitudinal): 17.64m / 9.62m/s = 1.83s (Medium Risk)
    * TTC (lateral): N/A as relative lateral velocity is zero. 
    * MDC:  ~4.27m (Low Risk)

    * Overall Risk: Medium (due to longitudinal TTC)


* **Obstacle 30291:** Front-left, longitudinal 17.54m, lateral 12.06m. Relative velocity: longitudinal -9.62 m/s, lateral -0.30 m/s.

    * Trajectory: Consistently front-left, gradually approaching longitudinally, very slowly approaching laterally. 

    * TTC (longitudinal): 17.54m / 9.62m/s = 1.82s (Medium Risk)
    * TTC (lateral): 12.06m / 0.3m/s = 40.2s (Negligible Risk)
    * MDC: ~12.06m (Negligible Risk)

    * Overall Risk: Medium (due to longitudinal TTC)


* **Obstacle 30294:** Rear-right, longitudinal -6.27m, lateral -3.66m. Relative velocity: longitudinal -9.35 m/s, lateral 1.04 m/s.

    * Trajectory: Moving further behind longitudinally, but approaching laterally from the right. The negative longitudinal values and velocity indicate the obstacle is already behind the ego vehicle and moving further away in that dimension. While it is moving towards the ego laterally, it is not a collision risk. 

    * TTC (longitudinal): N/A, separating
    * TTC (lateral): 3.66m / 1.04m/s = 3.52s (Low Risk)
    * MDC: ~3.66m (Low Risk)

    * Overall Risk: Low


* **Obstacle 30295:** Rear-right, longitudinal -8.01m, lateral -13.83m. Relative velocity: longitudinal -9.27 m/s, lateral 2.44 m/s.

    * Trajectory: Moving further behind longitudinally, but approaching laterally from the right. Similar to 30294, the longitudinal motion indicates separation. The lateral approach is not a collision risk due to separation in longitudinal.

    * TTC (longitudinal): N/A, separating
    * TTC (lateral): 13.83m / 2.44m/s = 5.67s (Negligible Risk)
    * MDC: ~13.83m (Negligible Risk)

    * Overall Risk: Negligible


* **Obstacle 30296:** Front, longitudinal 12.54m, lateral 0.00m. Relative velocity: longitudinal 0.14 m/s, lateral 0.05 m/s.

    * Trajectory: Almost stationary relative to the ego vehicle, slightly moving forward longitudinally and very minor lateral movement, essentially aligned. No immediate risk observed in the provided timesteps.

    * TTC (longitudinal): 12.54m / 0.14 m/s = 89.57s (Negligible Risk)
    * TTC (lateral): N/A - velocity is almost zero.
    * MDC: ~12.54m (Negligible Risk)

    * Overall Risk: Negligible
