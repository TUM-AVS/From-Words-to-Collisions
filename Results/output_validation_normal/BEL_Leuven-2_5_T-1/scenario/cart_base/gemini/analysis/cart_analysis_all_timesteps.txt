At t=0.9s, Ego is in lanelet 181. Obstacle 30296 is also in lanelet 875 (previously lanelet 181), and its position (-160.2518, -156.8482) is very close to Ego's position (-153.9606, -141.0077). Additionally, both are moving with relatively high speeds in a similar direction (orientations are close), with obstacle 30296 decelerating sharply. Although there's a small positional difference at t=0.9s, the trajectories and velocities suggest a very high probability of an imminent collision in the next few timesteps.  Other obstacles are far enough away to not pose an immediate threat.
