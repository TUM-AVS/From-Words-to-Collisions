### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 30290.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is far from the ego vehicle and poses no immediate threat based on current positions and trajectory history.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Obstacle is stationary based on the provided data, therefore posing no time-dependent risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 30291.0
- Distance Risk reason:  While the obstacle is somewhat distant from the ego vehicle, its trajectory over time suggests it's not on a direct collision course and maintains a safe lateral separation.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: The obstacle has a low velocity and isn't accelerating towards the ego vehicle, indicating minimal time-related risk.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- Obstacle ID: 30294.0
- Distance Risk reason: This obstacle is laterally separated and relatively far from the ego vehicle's current position and predicted trajectory.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: The obstacle's velocity is relatively low and does not indicate an immediate threat.  While its acceleration has fluctuated, the overall trend doesn't point towards a collision course.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4


- Obstacle ID: 30295.0
- Distance Risk reason:  The obstacle maintains a safe lateral distance from the ego vehicle's trajectory.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Although the obstacle is moving, its velocity is decreasing and not directed towards the ego vehicle.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4


- Obstacle ID: 30296.0
- Distance Risk reason: This obstacle is in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle and the longitudinal distance is decreasing. Requires careful monitoring. The y-coordinates suggest a possible lane change by this obstacle which would mitigate collision risk.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: Both the ego vehicle and this obstacle are moving in the same direction with similar velocities, but the obstacle is decelerating more aggressively than the ego vehicle. This increases the likelihood of the ego approaching the obstacle rapidly.
- Time safety score: 2
- Overall Risk score: 2

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. **Most critical obstacle:** Obstacle 30296.0 is the most critical as it shares the same lanelet (181.0) as the ego vehicle and is relatively close.
2. **Trajectory Analysis:** Over the 0.0s to 0.9s period, both the ego vehicle and obstacle 30296.0 move in the same general direction (negative Y). Obstacle 30296.0 initially has a slightly higher velocity, but it decelerates more rapidly than the ego vehicle between 0.5 and 0.9 seconds. This implies that a collision could occur or a lane change may be necessary.
3. **Relative position, velocity, and acceleration:** The relative longitudinal distance between the ego vehicle and obstacle 30296.0 is decreasing.  Their similar orientations combined with the relative deceleration difference makes this a risky situation.
4. **Collision determination:** At 0.9s, no collision has occurred. However, the decreasing distance and relative motion suggest a collision risk in future if their courses don't change.
5. **Reasoning:** Based on the current trends in position, velocity, and acceleration, there's a significant risk that the ego vehicle may collide with obstacle 30296.0. No other obstacle poses an immediate threat based on current information.
