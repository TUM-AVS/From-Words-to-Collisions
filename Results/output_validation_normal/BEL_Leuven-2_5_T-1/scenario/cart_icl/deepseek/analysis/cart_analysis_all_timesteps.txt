### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep (0.9 seconds):

### Obstacle Analysis:
1. **Obstacle ID: 30290.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Static obstacle at (-156.6809, -163.7599), far from ego's trajectory. Distance is increasing over time.
   - **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: No movement (velocity = 0). No risk of collision.
   - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)

2. **Obstacle ID: 30291.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Moving slowly away from ego's trajectory. Current position (-149.4056, -166.5453) is not intersecting.
   - **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: Low velocity (0.2964) and decelerating. No convergence with ego.
   - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)

3. **Obstacle ID: 30294.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Moving away from ego's lanelet (989.0 vs ego's 181.0). Position (-154.8783, -129.0501) is diverging.
   - **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: Low velocity (1.073) and accelerating away. No immediate threat.
   - **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low Risk)

4. **Obstacle ID: 30295.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: In lanelet 375.0, not intersecting with ego's path. Position (-163.6863, -123.6693) is diverging.
   - **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: Moderate velocity (2.4617) but moving away. Decelerating.
   - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)

5. **Obstacle ID: 30296.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Closest dynamic obstacle. Position (-160.2518, -156.8482) is in lanelet 875.0, which intersects with ego's lanelet 181.0. Distance is decreasing but still significant.
   - **Distance safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: High velocity (9.7606) but decelerating sharply (-4.2672). Relative velocity suggests no immediate collision.
   - **Time safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 3 (Medium Risk)

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. No obstacles are in direct collision path at the current timestep.
2. Obstacle 30296.0 is the most concerning due to its speed and lanelet intersection, but its deceleration and current distance mitigate risk.
3. All other obstacles are either static or moving away.
4. No immediate collision risk detected.
