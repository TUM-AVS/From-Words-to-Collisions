- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- Obstacle ID: 30296.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is in the same lanelet and moderately close.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: Both ego and obstacle are moving in the same general direction but obstacle's higher velocity could close distance over time.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3


### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
No immediate collision detected in the current timestep. However, Obstacle 30296 is in the same lane and approaching, requiring further monitoring.  This is not a collision scenario currently.
