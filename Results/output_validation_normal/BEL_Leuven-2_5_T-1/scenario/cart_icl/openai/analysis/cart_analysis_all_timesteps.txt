### Obstacle Analysis:

1. **Obstacle ID: 30288.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason:** This obstacle is in a different lanelet and consistently retains considerable distance from the ego vehicle. The trajectory over time shows it moving at a similar pace with minimal relative lateral position change.
   - **Distance safety score:** 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason:** The obstacle maintains a stable velocity and has stable minor accelerations, reflecting negligible risk over time.
   - **Time safety score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score:** 4 (Low Risk)

2. **Obstacle ID: 30289.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason:** It remains distant from the ego vehicle, increasing slightly its slow but consistent lateral trajectory.
   - **Distance safety score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason:** Consistent velocity with minimal changes indicates no approaching trajectory.
   - **Time safety score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)

3. **Obstacle ID: 30290.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason:** Stationary and remains stationary, posing no immediate risk given its location away from ego trajectory.
   - **Distance safety score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason:** No velocity or acceleration detected, indicating no time-based collision risk.
   - **Time safety score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)

4. **Obstacle ID: 30291.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason:** Located in a different lanelet and moving slowly.
   - **Distance safety score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason:** Low velocity and absence in approaching behavior throughout the scenario.
   - **Time safety score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)

5. **Obstacle ID: 30292.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason:** Located away from ego's path and further slowing down.
   - **Distance safety score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason:** Decreasing velocity, moving farther from ego over time.
   - **Time safety score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)

6. **Obstacle ID: 30293.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason:** Far lateral position change and is laterally moving away from the ego vehicle trajectory.
   - **Distance safety score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason:** Steady pace without significant deviation in the trajectory indicates no risk.
   - **Time safety score:** 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score:** 4 (Low Risk)

7. **Obstacle ID: 30294.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason:** Not on a collision course with the ego vehicle and posed negligible risk due to its slow maneuvers.
   - **Distance safety score:** 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason:** Despite considerable acceleration variations, the trajectory did not converge toward the ego.
   - **Time safety score:** 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score:** 4 (Low Risk)

8. **Obstacle ID: 30295.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason:** Occupies a separate path from ego, not joining the ego trajectory significantly over time.
   - **Distance safety score:** 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason:** Changes in velocity signify minimal risk due to consistent separation.
   - **Time safety score:** 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score:** 4 (Low Risk)

9. **Obstacle ID: 30296.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason:** Although in the same lanelet at final timestep, the distancing trajectory indicates sufficient clearance.
   - **Distance safety score:** 3 (Medium Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason:** Maintains a faster pace ahead of ego, but does not decrease distance sufficiently toward collision risk.
   - **Time safety score:** 3 (Medium Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score:** 3 (Medium Risk)

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
The scenario shows all obstacles having independent paths not intersecting with the ego vehicle's trajectory in the immediate succession. No clear encroachment on the ego vehicle's lane poses an imminent collision threat.
