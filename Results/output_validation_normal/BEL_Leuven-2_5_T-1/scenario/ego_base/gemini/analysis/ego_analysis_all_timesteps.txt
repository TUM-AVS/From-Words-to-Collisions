At t=0.9s, Obstacle 30294 is the closest obstacle laterally, at -3.66m to the right and -6.27m longitudinally behind the ego vehicle.  While it is moving away longitudinally at -9.35 m/s, it is moving towards the ego laterally at 1.04 m/s. This poses a potential risk, although not immediate. Other obstacles are further away and do not pose an immediate collision risk.
