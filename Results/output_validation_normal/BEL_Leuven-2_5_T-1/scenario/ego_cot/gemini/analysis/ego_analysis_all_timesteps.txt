### Safety analysis for timestep 0.9 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

**Assumptions and Clarifications:**

* Since "adjusted distances" are mentioned as critical but not provided in the scenario context, the provided real distances (DTClong, DTClat) will be used.  A proper analysis requires these adjusted values.  The analysis below is therefore limited and might be inaccurate.
* TTC calculations assume constant velocity. Realistically, accelerations play a role, but we lack precise future trajectory information.
* A diagonal distance will be calculated  using the longitudinal and lateral distances  to provide a combined distance metric.

### Obstacle Analysis:

**- Obstacle ID: 30290**
- Distance Risk reason: Located at 17.64m longitudinally and laterally (diagonal distance ~25m) in the front-left, presenting no immediate distance risk.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason:  Approaching longitudinally at -9.62 m/s but with no lateral relative motion and significant longitudinal distance, the TTC is not an immediate concern. 
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

**- Obstacle ID: 30291**
- Distance Risk reason: Located at 17.54m longitudinally and laterally (diagonal distance ~25m) in the front-left, presenting no immediate distance risk.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason:  Approaching longitudinally at -9.62 m/s and slightly laterally (-0.30m/s), but with considerable distance,  it's a low risk for now.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

**- Obstacle ID: 30294**
- Distance Risk reason: Although behind the ego vehicle longitudinally (-6.27m), the lateral distance is also -6.27m to the rear-right, suggesting a potential lane change conflict. This warrants attention.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: Moving away longitudinally at -9.35 m/s but approaching laterally at 1.04 m/s.  This lateral motion is concerning given the close proximity.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3

**- Obstacle ID: 30295**
- Distance Risk reason: Located rear-right at -8.01m longitudinally and laterally, posing no immediate risk.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Moving away longitudinally at -9.27 m/s and approaching laterally at 2.44 m/s.  The lateral motion is less concerning due to the increased longitudinal separation.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

**- Obstacle ID: 30296**
- Distance Risk reason: Located 12.54m longitudinally and laterally in front, posing no immediate distance risk.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Almost stationary relative to the ego vehicle (0.14 m/s longitudinally and 0.05m/s laterally). No immediate risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5



### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
    "CollisionObstacle": null,
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null,
    "IsCollisionScenario": false,
    "Justification": "No obstacle poses an immediate collision risk (Overall Risk Score 0 or 1) at this timestep. Obstacle 30294 presents the highest risk (Overall Risk Score 3) due to its lateral movement while in relatively close proximity during a potential lane change situation. However, it's not classified as 'extreme' or 'collision' based on the current data."
