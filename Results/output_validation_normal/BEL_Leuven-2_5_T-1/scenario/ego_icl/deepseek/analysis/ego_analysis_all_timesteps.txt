Let me analyze the most recent timestep (0.9 seconds) and assess collision risks for each obstacle:

1. Obstacle 30290 (Front-left):
   - Position: longitudinal 17.64m, lateral 4.27m
   - Relative velocity: longitudinal -9.62 m/s (approaching), lateral 0.00 m/s
   - MDC: 4.27m (lateral distance, stable)
   - TTC: 17.64/9.62 = 1.83s (longitudinal)
   - Risk: Medium (3) - approaching from front but still sufficient distance

2. Obstacle 30291 (Front-left):
   - Position: longitudinal 17.54m, lateral 12.06m
   - Relative velocity: longitudinal -9.62 m/s, lateral -0.30 m/s
   - MDC: 12.06m (lateral distance, slowly decreasing)
   - TTC: Not applicable (lateral distance increasing)
   - Risk: Low (4) - large lateral distance and moving away laterally

3. Obstacle 30294 (Rear-right):
   - Position: longitudinal -6.27m, lateral -3.66m
   - Relative velocity: longitudinal -9.35 m/s (moving away), lateral 1.04 m/s (approaching)
   - MDC: 3.66m (lateral distance, decreasing at 1.04 m/s)
   - TTC: 3.66/1.04 = 3.52s (lateral)
   - Risk: Medium (3) - lateral distance closing but still adequate

4. Obstacle 30295 (Rear-right):
   - Position: longitudinal -8.01m, lateral -13.83m
   - Relative velocity: longitudinal -9.27 m/s, lateral 2.44 m/s
   - MDC: 13.83m (lateral distance, decreasing)
   - TTC: 13.83/2.44 = 5.67s (lateral)
   - Risk: Low (4) - large lateral distance despite closing

5. Obstacle 30296 (Front):
   - Position: longitudinal 12.54m, lateral 0.00m
   - Relative velocity: longitudinal 0.14 m/s (moving away), lateral 0.05 m/s
   - MDC: 12.54m (longitudinal distance, increasing)
   - TTC: Not applicable (moving away)
   - Risk: No Risk (5) - moving away with alignment

Trajectory Analysis:
- All obstacles are either maintaining or increasing distance except for lateral movement of 30294
- No obstacles show imminent collision risk (TTC < 0.5s or MDC < 0.5m)
- Closest risk is Obstacle 30290 with TTC of 1.83s (Medium Risk)
