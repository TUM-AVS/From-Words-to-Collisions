### Obstacle Analysis

#### Obstacle 30290 (Front-left)
- **Most Recent Position:**
  - Adjusted Longitudinal Distance: 17.64 m
  - Adjusted Lateral Distance: 4.27 m
  - Relative Velocity: Longitudinal = -9.62 m/s, Lateral = 0.00 m/s
  - Motion: Moving toward ego longitudinally; no lateral motion
  
- **Trajectory Analysis:**
  - Consistently approaching from the front-left with decreasing longitudinal distance.
  
- **TTC Calculation:**
  - Longitudinal TTC = 17.64 m / 9.62 m/s ≈ 1.83 seconds
  - Lateral TTC is not applicable due to no relative motion.
  
- **MDC:**
  - Based purely on longitudinal trajectory since it's aligned:
  - MDC is approximately the current longitudinal distance due to lack of lateral convergence.

- **Risk Assessment:**
  - TTC suggests medium risk (3) since it's between 1.0s and 3.0s.
  - MDC > 3.0 meters suggests low risk.
  - **Overall Risk:** Medium Risk (3)

#### Obstacle 30291 (Front-left)
- **Most Recent Position:**
  - Adjusted Longitudinal Distance: 17.54 m
  - Adjusted Lateral Distance: 12.06 m
  - Relative Velocity: Longitudinal = -9.62 m/s, Lateral = -0.30 m/s
  - Motion: Moving toward longitudinally and laterally from the left.
  
- **Trajectory Analysis:**
  - Consistently approaching from the front-left with decreasing distance variance.

- **TTC Calculation:**
  - Longitudinal TTC = 17.54 m / 9.62 m/s ≈ 1.82 seconds
  - Lateral TTC is theoretically high due to small lateral relative velocity.

- **MDC:**
  - Longitudinally approaching suggests that the MDC could approximate the current distances due to large separation.
  
- **Risk Assessment:**
  - Medium risk (3) longitudinally based on TTC and current behavior.
  - Large separation laterally reduces overlap risk.
  - **Overall Risk:** Medium Risk (3)

#### Obstacle 30294 (Rear-right)
- **Most Recent Position:**
  - Adjusted Longitudinal Distance: -6.27 m
  - Adjusted Lateral Distance: -3.66 m
  - Relative Velocity: Longitudinal = -9.35 m/s, Lateral = 1.04 m/s
  - Motion: Moving away longitudinally, but approaching laterally from the right.

- **Trajectory Analysis:**
  - The obstacle is at a relatively large negative longitudinal but is consistently reducing the lateral distance from the right.
  
- **TTC Calculation for Lateral Approach:**
  - Cannot compute applicable TTC longitudinally due to divergence.
  - Lateral TTC = 3.66 m / 1.04 m/s ≈ 3.52 seconds 

- **MDC:**
  - Lateral trajectory could reduce MDC if further approaching faster, less significant in the longitudinal domain.

- **Risk Assessment:**
  - Medium risk (3) due to eventual possible lateral intersection.
  - **Overall Risk:** Medium Risk (3)

#### Obstacle 30295 (Rear-right)
- **Most Recent Position:**
  - Adjusted Longitudinal Distance: -8.01 m
  - Adjusted Lateral Distance: -13.83 m
  - Relative Velocity: Longitudinal = -9.27 m/s, Lateral = 2.44 m/s
  - Motion: Moving away longitudinally; approaching laterally from the right.

- **Trajectory Analysis:**
  - Far on longitudinal scale, noticeably lesser lateral convergence compared to others.
  
- **TTC Calculation:**
  - Lateral TTC = 13.83 m / 2.44 m/s ≈ 5.67 seconds (relatively safe)

- **MDC:**
  - Anticipated minimum distance stays minuscule due to large initial distances.

- **Risk Assessment:**
  - No Risk (5) due to apparent separation and lower criticality of trajectories.
  - **Overall Risk:** Low Risk (4)

#### Obstacle 30296 (Front)
- **Most Recent Position:**
  - Adjusted Longitudinal Distance: 12.54 m
  - Adjusted Lateral Distance: 0.00 m
  - Relative Velocity: Longitudinal = 0.14 m/s, Lateral = 0.05 m/s
  
- **MDC Claimed:**
  - Large distances and trajectories stable showing negligible collision risk.

- **Risk Assessment:**
  - MDC = current distance showing no immediate threat.
  - **Overall Risk:** Low Risk (4)

### Conclusion
No obstacles presented extremely immediate collision risks, as improved measures reflect across the locus of possible intersections.
