Obstacle 30215 is showing a potential risk.  It's in a different lanelet (543) than the ego vehicle (initially 176, then 872), but its y-coordinate is getting closer to the ego vehicle's y-coordinate over time.  While a collision doesn't appear imminent in the next second or two, the current trajectories warrant close monitoring.  The lateral movement of the ego vehicle into lanelet 872 adds uncertainty. More information about the lanelet geometry and relative headings would be needed for a more definitive assessment.

Obstacle 30218 is also a potential risk, located in lanelet 555. Its y-coordinate is also converging towards the ego vehicle and it has a much higher velocity.  Combined with the lane change of the ego vehicle, this situation deserves attention.

Obstacle 30219 is in lanelet 177, adjacent to the ego vehicle's initial lanelet 176.  While it has a high velocity and its y-coordinate is close to the ego's, its x-coordinate is significantly smaller, and it seems to be moving away. This makes it less of a concern compared to 30215 and 30218.

Obstacle 30214 is stationary and presents no immediate risk. Obstacle 30217 is moving slowly and also appears to present no immediate risk given its location and the ego vehicle's trajectory.

Given the lane change maneuver of the ego vehicle and the converging trajectories, obstacles 30215 and 30218 could become high risk in the near future.  However, based on the 1-second provided data, no collision is imminent.
