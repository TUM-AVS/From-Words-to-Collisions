Obstacle 30215 is consistently located close to the ego vehicle and moving in a similar direction, posing a potential collision risk. The y-coordinates suggest 30215 is slightly ahead and to the side of the ego vehicle.  While the distance between them hasn't decreased drastically in the given timeframe, the relatively small lateral separation combined with the speed of both vehicles requires close monitoring.

Obstacle 30218 also presents a potential risk. This obstacle is traveling significantly faster than the ego vehicle and moving in a roughly parallel direction.  While its y-coordinate suggests it is currently further away than 30215, its higher speed could lead to a rapid decrease in distance.

Obstacle 30219 is moving in a similar direction as the ego vehicle, but it's located further behind the ego vehicle and on a different lanelet (177 vs. ego's 176/872). Though the current risk seems low given the separation, the high speed of 30219 warrants monitoring.

Obstacle 30214 is stationary and poses no immediate threat based on current data.

Obstacle 30217 is located on a different lanelet and its distance to the ego vehicle is relatively large and not rapidly decreasing, presenting a low risk based on current information.

Considering the proximity and similar trajectory of obstacle 30215, it presents the highest risk within the presented timeframe. Therefore, it is classified as a high-risk obstacle (risk score 2). Obstacles 30218 and 30219 require continued monitoring but are not currently considered high risk.
