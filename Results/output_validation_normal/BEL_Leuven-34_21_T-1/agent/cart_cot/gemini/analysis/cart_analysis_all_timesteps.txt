Here's a collision risk analysis of the provided scenario focusing on the last timestep (0.9 seconds) and considering the obstacle trajectories:

**Ego Vehicle State at t=0.9s:**
* Position: (438.306, 376.8392)
* Orientation: 0.8387 rad
* Velocity: 5.355 m/s
* Acceleration: -0.5624 m/sÂ²
* Lanelet: 872.0

**Obstacles Analysis at t=0.9s:**

* **Obstacle 30214:**
    * Position: (449.5494, 370.9002)
    * Velocity: 0 m/s
    * Lanelet: 205.0
    * Analysis:  Static obstacle.  While not immediately close at this timestep, needs continued monitoring as ego's x-coordinate is increasing and approaching obstacle 30214's x value.

* **Obstacle 30215:**
    * Position: (434.9286, 391.3616)
    * Velocity: 7.1521 m/s
    * Lanelet: 543.0
    * Analysis:  Moving in a roughly parallel direction to the ego vehicle, but in a different lanelet and significantly further north in the Y-axis.  Low risk currently.

* **Obstacle 30217:**
    * Position: (454.3314, 363.7792)
    * Velocity: 1.0453 m/s
    * Lanelet: 205.0
    * Analysis: Moving slowly, further ahead and south of the ego vehicle. Low risk.

* **Obstacle 30218:**
    * Position: (456.4963, 389.2091)
    * Velocity: 13.0327 m/s
    * Lanelet: 555.0
    * Analysis: Fastest moving obstacle, located furthest ahead of the ego, but with higher y value in different lanelet.  Requires monitoring due to high speed but presents low risk for now.

* **Obstacle 30219:**
    * Position: (428.6204, 364.3306)
    * Velocity: 10.5751 m/s
    * Lanelet: 177.0
    * Analysis: Located behind and slightly to the south of the ego vehicle. Given its higher velocity and the ego vehicle decelerating, it presents a potential risk of collision and needs careful monitoring. Its trajectory suggests it might move closer to the ego vehicle within a second or two.

**Risk Assessment Summary:**

No obstacle poses an immediate collision risk (score 0 or 1) at t=0.9s. However, Obstacle 30219 deserves attention due to its relative velocity and position. The ego vehicle's deceleration, combined with 30219's speed, could lead to a high-risk situation in the near future. No obstacle is on a direct collision course with the ego vehicle in the current timestep.
