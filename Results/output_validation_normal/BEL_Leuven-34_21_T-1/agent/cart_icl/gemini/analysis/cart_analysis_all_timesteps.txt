At t=0.9s, the ego vehicle (ID 30216) is at (438.306, 376.8392) with a velocity of 5.355 m/s and an orientation of 0.8387 rad.  Let's analyze the risk posed by each obstacle:

* **Obstacle 30214:** Stationary at (449.5494, 370.9002).  Poses no immediate threat due to its lateral offset and the ego vehicle's forward motion. Risk: **Negligible (5)**

* **Obstacle 30215:** Located at (434.9286, 391.3616) with a velocity of 7.1521 m/s. This obstacle is significantly north of the ego vehicle and moving roughly parallel, albeit slightly faster, to the ego vehicle and poses no immediate threat but should be monitored. Risk: **Low (4)**

* **Obstacle 30217:** Located at (454.3314, 363.7792) with a velocity of 1.0453 m/s. This obstacle is east/northeast of the ego vehicle, and poses little risk due to its distance and slow speed. Risk: **Negligible (5)**

* **Obstacle 30218:** Located at (456.4963, 389.2091) with a velocity of 13.0327 m/s. This obstacle is far northeast of the ego vehicle and moving faster than the ego vehicle, posing no immediate threat. Risk: **Low (4)**

* **Obstacle 30219:** Located at (428.6204, 364.3306) with a velocity of 10.5751 m/s.  This obstacle is south of the ego vehicle.  While the y-coordinate suggests a potential risk if the ego vehicle were to swerve significantly, there is a considerable safety margin given the current trajectories. Risk: **Medium (3)**
