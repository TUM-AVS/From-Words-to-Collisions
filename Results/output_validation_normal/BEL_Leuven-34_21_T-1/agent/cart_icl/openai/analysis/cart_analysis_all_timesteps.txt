### Analysis:

1. **Obstacle 30214:**
   - This obstacle is stationary at position (449.5494, 370.9002) with velocity 0 m/s. It remains in lanelet 205.0 and does not pose any immediate threat to the ego vehicle.
   - MDC: Approximately 17.9 meters (from the Ego's position at the last timestamp).
   - Risk: **Negligible (5)**

2. **Obstacle 30215:**
   - This obstacle is moving forward in a different lanelet (543.0) and not posing any direct threat to the ego vehicle since it is moving away.
   - MDC: Approximately 14.7 meters at the last timestamp.
   - Risk: **Low (4)**

3. **Obstacle 30217:**
   - This obstacle's movement is consistent but remains in lanelet 205.0. It is descending with a slight velocity which is not directed towards the Ego.
   - MDC: More than 16 meters.
   - Risk: **Low (4)**

4. **Obstacle 30218:**
   - This obstacle is in a different lane and travelling in a parallel trajectory. While it is the fastest moving object but is not directed towards the Ego.
   - MDC: Approximately 19.3 meters, poses minimal risk due to adequate movement alignment and distance.
   - Risk: **Low (4)**

5. **Obstacle 30219:**
   - This obstacle is moving with a negative acceleration and in a lane different from Ego, thus not posing any direct threat.
   - Seems to cross at an unnecessary distance.
   - MDC: Roughly 13.8 meters
   - Risk: **Medium (3)**
