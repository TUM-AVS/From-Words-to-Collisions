At t=0.9s, Obstacle 30214 is right next to the ego longitudinally (0.0m) and slightly offset laterally (-10.72m).  While it appears to be moving away laterally, its longitudinal velocity suggests potential for collision if ego were to move slightly forward or if obstacle's trajectory changes. This represents a high risk.

Other obstacles are not a high risk at this timestep. Obstacle 30215 is moving away laterally. Obstacle 30217 is far away laterally. Obstacle 30218 is moving away both longitudinally and laterally. Obstacle 30219, though behind the ego and approaching, is still sufficiently far.
