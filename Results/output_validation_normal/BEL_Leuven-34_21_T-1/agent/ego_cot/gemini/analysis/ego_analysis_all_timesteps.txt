### Safety analysis for timestep 0.9s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

**- Obstacle ID: 30214**
- Distance Risk reason:  At 0.9s, this obstacle has reached a real distance of 0.0m both longitudinally and laterally, indicating a collision.
- Distance safety score: 0
- Time Risk reason: Collision is imminent.
- Time safety score: 0
- Overall Risk score: 0

**- Obstacle ID: 30215**
- Distance Risk reason: While laterally moving away (6.98 m/s), the longitudinal distance is decreasing (4.04m at 0.9s) and relative longitudinal velocity is negative (-3.78 m/s) suggesting a potential collision risk.
- Distance safety score: 2
- Time Risk reason: The closing longitudinal velocity warrants attention despite the lateral movement.
- Time safety score: 2
- Overall Risk score: 2

**- Obstacle ID: 30217**
- Distance Risk reason:  Similar to obstacle 30214, this obstacle shows 0.0m distance at 0.9s, indicating collision.
- Distance safety score: 0
- Time Risk reason: Collision imminent.
- Time safety score: 0
- Overall Risk score: 0

**- Obstacle ID: 30218**
- Distance Risk reason:  Large longitudinal and lateral distances (16.85m), and positive longitudinal velocity suggests no immediate risk.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Moving away from the ego vehicle.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

**- Obstacle ID: 30219**
- Distance Risk reason: Though behind the ego vehicle (-11.27m), the closing longitudinal velocity (4.90 m/s) raises some concern.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Requires monitoring due to the closing speed.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3
