Obstacle 30214: This obstacle is to the right of the ego vehicle.  Across the timesteps, the longitudinal distance has been decreasing while the lateral distance has remained relatively constant around -10m. At the last timestep, the longitudinal distance is 0.00m, meaning it is directly alongside the ego vehicle. The lateral distance is -10.72m.  Since the lateral distance is relatively large and the longitudinal velocity is negative (-5.36 m/s), indicating it's moving away longitudinally, there is no immediate collision risk.
    * MDC: approximately 10.72m (using primarily the lateral distance as it’s side-by-side)
    * TTC: Not applicable due to separating longitudinal movement.
    * Risk: 5 (Negligible Risk)

Obstacle 30215: This obstacle is in the front-left of the ego vehicle. Over the timesteps, it has been moving away laterally and towards the ego longitudinally, but the lateral movement is more dominant. At the last timestep, it is 4.04m in front and 10.61m to the left. The longitudinal velocity is -3.78 m/s, so it's moving away longitudinally.
    * MDC: approximately 4.04m
    * TTC: Not applicable due to separating longitudinal movement
    * Risk: 4 (Low Risk)

Obstacle 30217: This obstacle is to the right of the ego vehicle. Its longitudinal position is aligned with the ego vehicle (0.00m) across the last few timesteps. The lateral distance is consistently around -19m and slightly decreasing, indicating it is moving closer laterally, with a velocity of 1.01 m/s.  
    * MDC: approximately 19.04m (using primarily the lateral distance)
    * TTC: 19.04 / |1.01| ≈ 18.85s
    * Risk: 5 (Negligible Risk)


Obstacle 30218:  This obstacle starts in front and slightly to the right and moves further away in both directions over the timesteps. At the last timestep, it's 16.85m ahead longitudinally and -3.65m to the right laterally. The longitudinal velocity is positive and large (7.51 m/s), showing increasing separation.
    * MDC: approximately 16.85m 
    * TTC: Not applicable due to separating movement
    * Risk: 5 (Negligible Risk)

Obstacle 30219: This obstacle is directly behind the ego vehicle (lateral distance 0.00m) and approaching longitudinally. The longitudinal distance decreases across the timesteps from -15.66m to -11.27m at the last timestep. Its longitudinal velocity is 4.90 m/s.
    * MDC: 11.27m
    * TTC: 11.27 / 4.90 ≈ 2.30s
    * Risk: 3 (Medium Risk)
