To perform the risk analysis, I will examine each obstacle at the most recent timestep (0.9 seconds), using the adjusted distances and considering any trajectory insights from the previous timesteps. Obstacle IDs 30214, 30215, 30217, 30218, and 30219 will be evaluated for proximity, minimum distance to collision (MDC), and time-to-collision (TTC).

### Obstacle-by-Obstacle Analysis

#### Obstacle 30214
- **Position & Motion**: Right of ego vehicle. The adjusted longitudinal distance is effectively 0.00 m, indicating alignment. Lateral position is -10.72 m. The obstacle has no lateral motion but is aligned longitudinally with a closing longitudinal velocity of -5.36 m/s.
- **Trajectory Analysis**: The obstacle is maintaining its trajectory directly parallel and close to the ego vehicle's path.
- **TTC Calculation**: Impossible to calculate a meaningful positive TTC longitudinally as velocities indicate a pass already occurred or static alignments. Lateral movement is non-existent; hence, no collision is expected without lateral change.
- **MDC Calculation**: Longitudinal MDC is effectively 0 m, but lateral alignment negates collision.
- **Risk Score**: Given the precise alignment longitudinally with no lateral closing motion, the risk remains medium (3).

#### Obstacle 30215
- **Position & Motion**: Front-left of ego vehicle. Longitudinally 4.04 m and laterally 10.61 m. Moving away laterally with longitudinal approach.
- **Trajectory Analysis**: Moving slightly diagonally outward to the left and compares to the previous distance shows increasing lateral separation.
- **TTC Calculation**: Only relevant in the longitudinal direction due to diagonal motion. 
  - Longitudinal TTC = 4.04 m / 3.78 m/s = ~1.07 seconds.
- **MDC Calculation**: With increasing lateral distance, the MDC exceeds critical thresholds.
- **Risk Score**: Given the outward trajectory and calculated TTC, the risk is medium (3).

#### Obstacle 30217
- **Position & Motion**: Right of ego vehicle. The obstacle has exact longitudinal alignment (0.00 m) and is moving laterally towards the ego vehicle (lateral position -19.04 m) with closing speed.
- **Trajectory Analysis**: Lateral distance slightly decreasing, increasing urgency. Consistent lateral approach from the previous timesteps.
- **TTC Calculation**: Lateral TTC = 19.04 m / 1.01 m/s = ~18.84 seconds.
- **MDC Calculation**: Lateral MDC not close; insured largely longitudinal alignment without collision.
- **Risk Score**: With significant lateral distance, retains low risk (4).

#### Obstacle 30218
- **Position & Motion**: Front-right of ego car. Longitudinally 16.85 m away, outward lateral motion.
- **Trajectory Analysis**: Continues to move away longitudinally and laterally. 
- **TTC Calculation**: Longitudinal only as it's the approach path:
  - Negative relative velocity (moving away), no meaningful positive TTC applicable.
- **MDC Calculation**: Additional distance confirms negligible risk levels.
- **Risk Score**: Risk is negligible (5).

#### Obstacle 30219
- **Position & Motion**: Behind and aligned laterally (0.00 m). Longitudinal position is -11.27 m with approaching speed.
- **Trajectory Analysis**: Consistently approaching.
- **TTC Calculation**: Longitudinal approach; danger if close:
  - Longitudinal TTC = 11.27 m / 4.90 m/s = ~2.30 seconds.
- **MDC Calculation**: Stable approach, MDC over 5 m confirming trajectory alignment primacy.
- **Risk Score**: Position and speed increase medium risk (3).

In summary, Obstacle 30214, 30215 and 30219 present a medium risk due to certain alignment and motion characteristics, whereas Obstacle 30217 is low risk given its higher safe lateral distance. Obstacle 30218 near negligible risk owing greater relative distances and moving path away from ego vehicle.
