At t=0.9s, Ego is in lanelet 872.0 and decelerating. Let's analyze the obstacles:

* **Obstacle 30214.0:** Stationary and far from Ego. Negligible risk.
* **Obstacle 30215.0:**  Moving in lanelet 543.0, diverging from Ego's trajectory. Low risk.
* **Obstacle 30217.0:**  Moving slowly in lanelet 205.0, far from Ego. Negligible risk.
* **Obstacle 30218.0:** Moving in lanelet 555.0, diverging from Ego and no immediate risk is apparent. Low risk.
* **Obstacle 30219.0:** Moving in lanelet 177.0, which might be adjacent to Ego's lanelet 872.0. Further information about the lanelets' relative positions and their geometry is needed to determine if there is a risk of collision. Currently, the lateral distance seems large enough, and the trajectories aren't converging rapidly enough to warrant extreme or collision risk. Medium risk.

{
    "CollisionObstacles": [],
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null,
    "ScenarioAnalysis": {
        "IsCollisionScenario": false,
        "Reasoning": "No obstacle poses an immediate collision risk at t=0.9s. Though Obstacle 30219.0 is in a potentially adjacent lanelet, the current trajectories and distances don't indicate extreme risk without more lanelet geometry information."
    }
}
