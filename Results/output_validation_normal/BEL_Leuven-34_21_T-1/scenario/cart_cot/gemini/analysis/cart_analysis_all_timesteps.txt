### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 30214.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 30214.0 is stationary and located at (449.5494, 370.9002), while the ego vehicle is at (438.306, 376.8392) and moving with a velocity of 5.355 and decelerating. The obstacle is in a different lanelet (205.0) than the ego vehicle (872.0). The distance between them is significant, and their trajectories do not intersect.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason:  The obstacle is stationary, posing no immediate time-related risk. The ego vehicle is moving away from the obstacle's lanelet.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 30215.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 30215.0 is located at (434.9286, 391.3616) and moving with a velocity of 7.1521. The ego vehicle is at (438.306, 376.8392) and moving with a velocity of 5.355.  They are in different lanelets (543.0 and 872.0, respectively). Although the x-coordinates are close, the y-coordinate difference is substantial and increasing due to diverging trajectories.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: While the obstacle is moving faster than the ego vehicle, the diverging trajectories reduce the risk over time. 
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- Obstacle ID: 30217.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 30217.0 is located at (454.3314, 363.7792) and moving slowly at 1.0453. The ego vehicle is at (438.306, 376.8392). The obstacle is in a different lanelet (205.0) and poses no immediate threat due to the distance and diverging trajectories.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: The slow speed and diverging trajectory of the obstacle reduce the time-related risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 30218.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 30218.0 is located at (456.4963, 389.2091), while the ego vehicle is at (438.306, 376.8392). They are in different lanelets (555.0 and 872.0). There is a considerable distance between them, and their trajectories do not intersect.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Although the obstacle is moving faster than the ego vehicle, the diverging trajectories and considerable distance minimize the time-related risk.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- Obstacle ID: 30219.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 30219.0 is at (428.6204, 364.3306), and the ego vehicle is at (438.306, 376.8392). While in different lanelets (177.0 and 872.0), they are the closest in proximity among the obstacles. However, the distance is still substantial, and their trajectories are diverging.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Despite the obstacle's higher speed and deceleration, the diverging trajectories significantly reduce the time-related risk.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4


### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. **Most critical obstacles:** Obstacle 30219.0 and 30215.0 are the closest to the ego vehicle throughout the scenario.
2. **Trajectory analysis:** Over the ten timesteps, the ego vehicle changes lanelets from 176.0 to 872.0. The obstacle 30219.0 stays in 177 and obstacle 30215 stays in 543.0. Their trajectories diverge, increasing the distance between them. The other obstacles remain in separate lanes and maintain safe distances.
3. **Relative positions, velocities, and accelerations:** No obstacle shows a trajectory or velocity pattern indicating a likely collision with the ego vehicle. Although some obstacles have higher speeds, their diverging paths and decelerations mitigate the risk.
4. **Collision determination:** No collision has occurred or is imminent based on the provided data.
5. **Reasoning:** The combination of distances, diverging trajectories, and deceleration patterns indicates a safe scenario.

{
    "CollisionObstacles": null,
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null,
    "ScenarioAnalysis": {
        "IsCollisionScenario": false,
        "Reasoning": "No obstacle presents a collision risk. All obstacles maintain safe distances and exhibit diverging trajectories from the ego vehicle over the observed time period. Although some obstacles have higher velocities, their movement patterns, combined with the ego vehicle's trajectory and deceleration, do not suggest an imminent collision."
