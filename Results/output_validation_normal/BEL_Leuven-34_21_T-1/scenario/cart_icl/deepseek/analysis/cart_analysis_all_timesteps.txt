### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep (0.9 seconds):

### Obstacle Analysis:

1. **Obstacle ID: 30214.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Static obstacle (velocity = 0), located at (449.5494, 370.9002). Ego is at (438.306, 376.8392). Distance is ~11.5m and increasing as ego moves away. No immediate collision risk.
   - **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: Static obstacle, no relative velocity.
   - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 5

2. **Obstacle ID: 30215.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Located at (434.9286, 391.3616), moving away from ego (y-coordinate increasing). Distance is ~14.5m and increasing.
   - **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: Velocity (7.1521) is higher than ego's (5.355), moving away.
   - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 5

3. **Obstacle ID: 30217.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Located at (454.3314, 363.7792), moving slowly (velocity = 1.0453) away from ego. Distance is ~16m and increasing.
   - **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: Low velocity and decelerating (-0.866), moving away.
   - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 5

4. **Obstacle ID: 30218.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Located at (456.4963, 389.2091), moving away from ego at high speed (13.0327). Distance is ~18m and increasing rapidly.
   - **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: High velocity and accelerating (2.626), moving away.
   - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 5

5. **Obstacle ID: 30219.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Located at (428.6204, 364.3306), moving towards ego but at a decreasing speed (10.5751, decelerating at -4.2888). Distance is ~13m and closing slowly.
   - **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: Decelerating rapidly, will likely stop before reaching ego.
   - **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 4

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. Ego is decelerating (velocity decreasing from 7.2228 to 5.355 over 0.9s).
2. All obstacles are either static or moving away from ego, except 30219.0 which is closing but decelerating rapidly.
3. No obstacles are in immediate collision path or same lanelet as ego (lanelet 872.0).
4. Closest obstacle (30219.0) is at safe distance and decelerating.
