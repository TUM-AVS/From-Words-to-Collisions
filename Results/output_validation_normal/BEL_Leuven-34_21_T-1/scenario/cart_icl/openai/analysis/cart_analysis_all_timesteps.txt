- **Time safety score:** 5
- **Overall Risk score:** 5

**Obstacle: 30222.0**
- **Distance Risk reason:** Positioned far within lanelet 205.0 indicates no direct threat.
- **Distance safety score:** 5
- **Time Risk reason:** Low relative velocity with minor acceleration.
- **Time safety score:** 5
- **Overall Risk score:** 5

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
Given the positions and movements of obstacles, none are in immediate collision paths with the ego vehicle. All show safe distancing, regulated trajectories, and manageable speeds and accelerations without crossing the intended path of ego.

### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
    "CollisionObstacles": [],
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null,
    "ScenarioAnalysis": {
        "IsCollisionScenario": false,
        "Reasoning": "All obstacles maintain safe distances and velocities with no immediate collision paths relative to the ego."
    }
}
```
This analysis indicates that the current scenario has no threats of collision nor extreme risk associated with any obstacle.
