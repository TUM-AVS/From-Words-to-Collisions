Obstacle 30214 is at longitudinal 0.0m and lateral -10.72m relative to the ego vehicle, indicating a potential collision. It is positioned to the right of the ego-vehicle. Although lateral movement is minimal, the near zero longitudinal distance suggests a collision has likely occurred in this timestep. This obstacle poses the most significant risk.

Obstacle 30215 is located at longitudinal 4.04m and lateral 10.61m relative to the ego vehicle. It is moving toward the ego longitudinally but away laterally. Considering the distances and relative velocities, this obstacle does not present an immediate collision risk.

Obstacle 30217 is at longitudinal 0.0m and lateral -19.04m relative to the ego.  The lateral distance suggests it's not an immediate collision threat, despite the zero longitudinal distance reading. Further investigation is needed to determine the possibility of a collision with its current trajectory.

Obstacle 30218 is at longitudinal 16.85m and lateral -3.65m and moving away from the ego vehicle, posing no risk.

Obstacle 30219 is at longitudinal -11.27m and lateral 0.00m, indicating it is behind the ego vehicle.  While it's approaching the ego from behind, the distance and relative velocity suggest it poses no immediate risk.
