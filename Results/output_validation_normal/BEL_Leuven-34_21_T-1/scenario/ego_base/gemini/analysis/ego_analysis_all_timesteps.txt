Obstacle 30214 is at the right of the ego vehicle with a longitudinal distance of 0.0m, indicating it's aligned longitudinally with the ego vehicle. Although its relative longitudinal velocity is negative, suggesting movement towards the ego vehicle, the context cuts off abruptly. More information about future timesteps is needed to definitively assess the risk, but given the current proximity, it represents a potential collision risk.

Obstacle 30215 is located in the front-left of the ego vehicle and is moving away laterally.  The longitudinal distance is decreasing but still relatively safe at 4.04 meters. This obstacle does not pose an immediate threat.

Obstacle 30217 is at the right of the ego vehicle with 0.0m longitudinal distance, similarly aligned with the ego vehicle like Obstacle 30214.  While its negative longitudinal velocity indicates motion towards the ego vehicle, further timesteps are needed to completely determine the risk.  Due to the close proximity, there's a potential collision risk here as well.

Obstacle 30218 is moving away both longitudinally and laterally from the ego vehicle and poses no immediate risk.

Obstacle 30219 is behind the ego vehicle and approaching longitudinally. Although it has some lateral movement, it's unclear whether it will cross the ego vehicle's path. Without more future information, the risk level is uncertain, but there is a potential risk if its trajectory intersects with the ego vehicle's.


**Risk Levels and Definitions:**
<Collision (Score: 0)>: Actual collision has occurred or is unavoidable within the next timestep.
<Extreme Risk (Score: 1)>: Immediate collision or very high likelihood of impact. Urgent action is required.
<High Risk (Score: 2)>: Close to collision or highly probable collision path. Needs prompt attention and quick manoeuvring.
<Medium Risk (Score: 3)>: Moderate collision risk but manageable with timely reactions and proper strategies.
<Low Risk (Score: 4)>: Minimal collision risk. The situation is controllable with sufficient time to react.
<Negligible Risk (Score: 5)>: No significant collision risk. Obstacles are either moving away or far enough not to interfere.
