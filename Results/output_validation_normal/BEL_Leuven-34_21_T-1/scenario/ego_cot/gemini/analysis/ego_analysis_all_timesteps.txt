### Safety analysis for timestep 0.9 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

**Missing Information:** The provided scenario lacks crucial information for accurate TTC and MDC calculation. We need the ego vehicle's speed and dimensions, as well as a clear definition of "adjusted distances" (adjusted_d_long, adjusted_d_lat).  Since this data isn't available, I'll make reasonable assumptions for demonstration purposes, but in a real-world scenario, these assumptions should be replaced with actual data.

**Assumptions:**

* **Ego vehicle dimensions:**  A typical mid-size car (4.5m long, 1.8m wide).
* **Adjusted distances:** Assuming adjusted_d_long and adjusted_d_lat represent the distance to the closest edges of the ego vehicle and obstacle bounding boxes.  For simplicity, I'll assume they are roughly equal to the provided real distances minus half the ego vehicle's dimensions in the respective directions.
* **Ego vehicle speed:** Assuming the ego vehicle is stationary for simplicity. This will affect TTC calculations significantly in a real scenario.


### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 30214**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is at (0.0, 0.0), indicating a collision or overlap in both longitudinal and lateral directions.
- Distance safety score: 0
- Time Risk reason:  Given the near-zero distance and negative longitudinal velocity, collision is imminent.
- Time safety score: 0
- Overall Risk score: 0

- **Obstacle ID: 30215**
- Distance Risk reason:  At 4.04m longitudinal and lateral distance, there's a moderate risk depending on the exact adjusted distances and ego vehicle motion. 
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: Negative longitudinal velocity indicates the obstacle is approaching, but lateral motion is away from the ego vehicle.  TTC needs ego vehicle motion for proper evaluation.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3

- **Obstacle ID: 30217**
- Distance Risk reason:  Similar to 30214, coordinates (0.0, 0.0) indicate a collision or overlap.
- Distance safety score: 0
- Time Risk reason:  Negative longitudinal and positive lateral velocities suggest an imminent collision.
- Time safety score: 0
- Overall Risk score: 0

- **Obstacle ID: 30218**
- Distance Risk reason: At 16.85m in both directions, the obstacle poses no immediate risk.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Positive longitudinal velocity suggests it is moving away, further reducing risk. Lateral motion is negligible at this distance.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 30219**
- Distance Risk reason: At -11.27m, the obstacle is behind the ego vehicle at a safe distance.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: While it's approaching from behind (positive longitudinal velocity), the distance is sufficient for now.  TTC calculation needs ego vehicle motion data.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

```json
{
  "CollisionObstacle": {
    "ObstacleID": ["30214", "30217"],
    "OverallRiskScore": "0"
  },
  "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null,
  "IsCollisionScenario": true,
  "Justification": "Obstacles 30214 and 30217 show a distance of (0.0, 0.0) to the ego vehicle at the most recent timestep, indicating a collision.  Their motion also supports this conclusion, with both showing negative longitudinal velocities relative to the ego vehicle."
