Let me analyze each obstacle at the most recent timestep (0.9 seconds) and determine collision risks.

### Obstacle 30214 Analysis:
- Position: Right of ego (longitudinal alignment)
- Adjusted distances: longitudinal 0.00m, lateral -10.72m
- Relative velocity: longitudinal -5.36 m/s (approaching), lateral 0.00 m/s
- Motion: Moving toward ego longitudinally, no lateral motion
- MDC: 10.72m (lateral distance)
- TTC: Not applicable (no lateral motion, longitudinal alignment already exists)
- Risk: No Risk (5) - Large lateral distance despite longitudinal alignment

### Obstacle 30215 Analysis:
- Position: Front-left
- Adjusted distances: longitudinal 4.04m, lateral 10.61m
- Relative velocity: longitudinal -3.78 m/s (approaching), lateral 6.98 m/s (moving away)
- Motion: Approaching longitudinally, moving away laterally
- MDC: 4.04m (longitudinal distance)
- TTC: 4.04/3.78 = 1.07 seconds
- Risk: Medium Risk (3) - Approaching but with increasing lateral distance

### Obstacle 30217 Analysis:
- Position: Right (longitudinal alignment)
- Adjusted distances: longitudinal 0.00m, lateral -19.04m
- Relative velocity: longitudinal -5.10 m/s, lateral 1.01 m/s (approaching)
- Motion: Moving toward ego laterally from right
- MDC: 19.04m (lateral distance)
- TTC: 19.04/1.01 = 18.85 seconds
- Risk: No Risk (5) - Very large lateral distance despite slight approach

### Obstacle 30218 Analysis:
- Position: Front-right
- Adjusted distances: longitudinal 16.85m, lateral -3.65m
- Relative velocity: longitudinal 7.51 m/s (moving away), lateral -2.10 m/s (moving away)
- Motion: Moving away in both dimensions
- MDC: min(16.85, 3.65) = 3.65m
- TTC: Not applicable (diverging paths)
- Risk: Low Risk (4) - Moving away but still relatively close laterally

### Obstacle 30219 Analysis:
- Position: Behind (lateral alignment)
- Adjusted distances: longitudinal -11.27m, lateral 0.00m
- Relative velocity: longitudinal 4.90 m/s (approaching), lateral -2.58 m/s
- Motion: Approaching from behind
- MDC: 11.27m (longitudinal distance)
- TTC: 11.27/4.90 = 2.30 seconds
- Risk: Medium Risk (3) - Approaching from behind but with sufficient distance

### Trajectory Analysis:
Looking at previous timesteps:
- No obstacles show rapidly decreasing distances that would indicate imminent collision
- Obstacle 30214 shows consistent longitudinal approach but maintains large lateral distance
- Obstacle 30217 shows slight lateral approach but from very far away
- All other obstacles either maintain or increase distances

### Conclusion:
No obstacles meet the criteria for Collision (0) or Extreme Risk (1). The closest is Obstacle 30215 with Medium Risk (3).
