* **Obstacle 30214 (Right):** This obstacle has been consistently approaching the ego vehicle longitudinally and is now at 0.00m longitudinally, meaning it's aligned with the ego vehicle. The lateral distance is -10.72m.  The negative longitudinal velocity indicates the obstacle might be just passing the ego vehicle. Given the alignment and recent rapid approach, though it is unlikely, this obstacle is a collision risk.  The exact lateral distance, as per the last timestamp, is -10.72 m, which is larger than collision threshold, thus we conclude that it is not an immediate collision risk. There is no lateral movement (0.00 m/s). The combination of longitudinal alignment with a negative velocity suggests the obstacle is slightly behind or just passing the ego vehicle.
    * **MDC:** Approximately 10.72m (using lateral distance as a proxy).
    * **TTC:** Not applicable due to negative longitudinal velocity. 
    * **Risk:** 5 (No Risk)

* **Obstacle 30215 (Front-left):** This obstacle has been approaching the ego vehicle longitudinally while moving away laterally. The longitudinal distance is 4.04m and the lateral distance is 10.61m. The negative longitudinal velocity and positive lateral velocity confirm this.  The distance suggests no immediate risk but a potential collision if the lateral motion stops.
    * **MDC:**  Approximately 4.04m (primarily longitudinal).
    * **TTC (Longitudinal):** 4.04m / 3.78 m/s ≈ 1.07s
    * **Risk:** 4 (Low Risk)


* **Obstacle 30217 (Right):**  This obstacle is longitudinally aligned with the ego vehicle (0.00m) and at a lateral distance of -19.04m. The consistent negative lateral distance indicates it's to the right of the ego vehicle, and the positive lateral velocity indicates the obstacle is moving to the left, towards the ego vehicle laterally. With such a large lateral distance and movement to the left, there is no current collision risk.
    * **MDC:** Approximately 19.04m (lateral distance).
    * **TTC:** Not applicable due to zero longitudinal velocity. 
    * **Risk:** 5 (No Risk)


* **Obstacle 30218 (Front-right):** This obstacle is moving away from the ego vehicle both longitudinally (16.85m) and laterally (-3.65m). The positive longitudinal and negative lateral velocities confirm this diverging trajectory.
    * **MDC:** Approximately 3.65 m (lateral distance).
    * **TTC:** Not applicable due to positive longitudinal velocity (moving away).
    * **Risk:** 4 (Low Risk).

* **Obstacle 30219 (Behind):** This obstacle is behind the ego vehicle (-11.27m) and approaching longitudinally with a positive velocity (4.90m/s).  The lateral distance is near-zero with some fluctuation around 0m, so there's potential risk in the future if the lateral distance does not change more significantly.
    * **MDC:** Approximately 0m (lateral distance).
    * **TTC:** -11.27m / 4.90m/s ≈ -2.30s. Negative TTC can mean the risk has passed but since the rear distance is closing rapidly from -15.66 to -11.27m over 0.9s this must be monitored.
    * **Risk:** 4 (Low Risk). Though TTC appears to be low (2.30s), this obstacle is behind the ego car and moving towards the ego car.  It is closing in distance rapidly and presents a potential rear-end risk in the future.
    


**Conclusion:** This is NOT a collision scenario. No obstacle has a risk score of 0 (collision) or 1 (extreme risk). Obstacle 30214 presents a theoretical longitudinal collision risk given current position and previous velocity, but the stable lateral distance at the latest timestamp suggests the obstacle has likely just passed.

  "IsCollisionScenario": false,
  "Justification": "No obstacle has a risk score of 0 or 1. Although obstacle 30214 shows longitudinal alignment, its lateral distance suggests it is not colliding."
