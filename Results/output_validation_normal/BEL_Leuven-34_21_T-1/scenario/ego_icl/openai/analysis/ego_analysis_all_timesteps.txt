To analyze the risk of a collision in this scenario, we will focus on each obstacle's trajectory and relative position at the most recent timestamp (0.9 seconds) and calculate the Time-to-Collision (TTC) and Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC) using the adjusted distances and velocities provided.

### Obstacle-by-Obstacle Analysis

1. **Obstacle 30214 (Right)**
   - **Position**: Longitudinal 0.00m, Lateral -10.72m
   - **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal -5.36 m/s (towards ego)
   - **Motion**: Exact longitudinal alignment, no lateral motion
   - **TTC**: Cannot be computed because the longitudinal velocity indicates a zero gap (aligned), immediate intervention required.
   - **MDC**: Longitudinal distance is 0.00m, indicating possible contact.
   - **Risk Assessment**: Collision risk as MDC = 0 implies direct involvement.

2. **Obstacle 30215 (Front-left)**
   - **Position**: Longitudinal 4.04m, Lateral 10.61m
   - **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal -3.78 m/s, Lateral 6.98 m/s (moving away laterally)
   - **Motion**: Driving toward ego car longitudinally; moving away laterally
   - **TTC**: Longitudinal TTC = 4.04m / 3.78 m/s ≈ 1.07s
   - **MDC**: Longitudinal distance is 4.04m; divergent laterally
   - **Risk Assessment**: Medium risk due to decreasing longitudinal gap, but lateral divergence lowers immediate risk.

3. **Obstacle 30217 (Right)**
   - **Position**: Longitudinal 0.00m, Lateral -19.04m
   - **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal -5.10 m/s, Lateral 1.01 m/s (towards ego)
   - **Motion**: Exact longitudinal alignment, moving towards laterally
   - **TTC and MDC**: Longitudinal alignment with proximity lateral movement
   - **Risk Assessment**: Collision risk if lateral convergence continues at pace with longitudinal alignment.

4. **Obstacle 30218 (Front-right)**
   - **Position**: Longitudinal 16.85m, Lateral -3.65m
   - **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal 7.51 m/s (away from ego)
   - **Motion**: Moving away longitudinally and laterally
   - **TTC and MDC**: Increasing distances mean no immediate collision path.
   - **Risk Assessment**: No risk as both longitudinal and lateral distances are increasing.

5. **Obstacle 30219 (Behind)**
   - **Position**: Longitudinal -11.27m, Lateral 0.00m
   - **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal 4.90 m/s (towards ego)
   - **Motion**: Exact lateral alignment, approaching from behind
   - **TTC**: Longitudinal TTC = 11.27m / 4.90 m/s ≈ 2.30s
   - **MDC**: Longitudinal distance still increasing as no lateral conflict
   - **Risk Assessment**: Medium risk due to approach trajectory, but time/space to intervene.

### Conclusion

- **Collision Scenario**: Obstacle 30214 shows a direct involvement with zero MDC, effectively a collision situation, while Obstacle 30217 stays an extreme risk given its alignment and approach.
- **JSON Summary**:

```json
{
    "CollisionObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "30214",
        "OverallRiskScore": "0"
    },
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "30217",
        "OverallRiskScore": "1"
    },
    "IsCollisionScenario": true,
    "Justification": "Obstacle 30214 is directly aligned with the ego vehicle at zero longitudinal distance, indicating a collision scenario. Obstacle 30217's proximity and lateral convergence further emphasize extreme risk conditions."
}
```

In this scenario, a clear collision is detected for Obstacle 30214 due to the zero MDC and alignment, and Obstacle 30217 presents an extreme risk with its lateral approach towards the ego vehicle. Thus, immediate action is necessary to mitigate collision impacts.
