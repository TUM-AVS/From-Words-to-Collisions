The ego vehicle and obstacle 30215.0 are in the same lanelet (176.0). The obstacle is ahead of the ego vehicle and both are moving in roughly the same direction (similar orientations, though the obstacle's orientation is changing more rapidly). The distance between them is decreasing over time.  Let's look at the longitudinal distance at each timestep:

* **0.1s:** sqrt((402.9-386.4)^2 + (361.9-368.3)^2) ≈ 16.8m
* **0.2s:** sqrt((405.0-388.0)^2 + (361.2-367.7)^2) ≈ 17.4m
* **0.3s:** sqrt((407.0-389.5)^2 + (360.7-367.1)^2) ≈ 17.8m
* **0.4s:** sqrt((409.0-390.9)^2 + (360.4-366.5)^2) ≈ 18.4m
* **0.5s:** sqrt((411.0-392.2)^2 + (360.3-366.0)^2) ≈ 19.0m
* **0.6s:** sqrt((412.8-393.5)^2 + (360.4-365.5)^2) ≈ 19.6m
* **0.7s:** sqrt((414.6-394.8)^2 + (360.8-365.0)^2) ≈ 20.1m
* **0.8s:** sqrt((416.3-396.0)^2 + (361.4-364.6)^2) ≈ 20.5m
* **0.9s:** sqrt((417.8-397.2)^2 + (362.0-364.1)^2) ≈ 20.7m


While the obstacle is ahead and initially gets a little closer, the distance between the ego vehicle and the obstacle starts increasing significantly from 0.4 seconds onwards.  Given the current trajectories and decelerations, a collision is not imminent, nor is there an extreme risk of collision.  There is no collision. While they are in the same lane, the distance is increasing, suggesting the risk is lessening over time.  Therefore, we assess the risk as *Low (4)* or even *Negligible (5)* depending on the specific criteria for those levels.  Since the prompt forces us to choose a risk between 0-2 if applicable, the closest appropriate value, given the increasing distance, is null for all three risk categories.
