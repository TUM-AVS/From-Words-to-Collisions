The ego vehicle and obstacle 30215.0 are in the same lanelet (176.0).  The obstacle is ahead of the ego vehicle and both are moving in roughly the same direction (similar orientations, though the obstacle is turning more). The longitudinal distance between them is decreasing over time. While the obstacle's velocity is higher than the ego vehicle's, both are decelerating. 

Looking at the positions:

* **t=0.1s:** Obstacle is ~18 meters ahead.
* **t=0.9s:** Obstacle is ~20 meters ahead. This is a very important indicator of a risk decrease.

Initially, it seemed like a high risk situation developing, but the distance is not rapidly closing, the obstacle is turning, and the velocity difference also does not suggest an immediate collision. The closing rate is not constant and the obstacle's turning behavior decreases the risk. Given this trend we can consider the obstacle at least a medium risk. More information is needed to accurately assess the risk beyond the current timeframe.
