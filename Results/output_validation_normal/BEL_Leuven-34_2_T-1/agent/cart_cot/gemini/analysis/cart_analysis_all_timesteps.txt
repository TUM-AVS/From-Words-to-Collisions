At t=0.9s, the ego vehicle is at (397.1757, 364.115) with a velocity of 11.9806 and the obstacle (ID 30215.0) is at (417.8307, 362.0337) with a velocity of 17.1559. Both are in the same lane (176.0).

**Analysis:**

1. **Longitudinal TTC:** The obstacle is ahead of the ego vehicle in the x-direction.  The relative velocity is approximately 17.1559 - 11.9806 = 5.1753. The longitudinal distance is 417.8307 - 397.1757 = 20.655.  Therefore, the approximate longitudinal TTC is 20.655 / 5.1753 ≈ 3.99 seconds.

2. **Lateral TTC:** The lateral distance is small (364.115 - 362.0337 = 2.0813). While the obstacle's orientation is changing rapidly, suggesting a lane change or turn, the current lateral distance and the relative velocities suggest a moderate risk in the immediate future if the obstacle continues its current trajectory. We need to consider that the lateral distance is small, and lateral movement from either vehicle could quickly lead to a collision.

3. **MDC:** The Minimum Distance between Centers (MDC) at t=0.9s is calculated as sqrt((417.8307 - 397.1757)^2 + (362.0337 - 364.115)^2) ≈ sqrt(427.1025 + 4.3379) ≈ 20.77.

4. **Prediction:** Given the decreasing velocities (negative accelerations), the current trajectories, and the MDC and TTC values, a direct collision is not imminent within the next few timesteps.  However, the lateral distance is small and decreasing. The obstacle's rapid orientation change further complicates the prediction and adds to the risk. It should be considered a potential hazard.

5. **Risk Assessment:** 
   - The relatively high longitudinal TTC (approximately 4 seconds) decreases the immediate risk of a rear-end collision. However, the lateral distance is quite low (around 2 meters), and coupled with a rapid change in the obstacle's orientation, suggests there's a non-negligible chance of a side-swipe collision.
   - Although the longitudinal TTC offers some buffer, we should classify the obstacle as a high risk (OverallRiskScore = 2), because a small deviation in either vehicle's trajectory or an unexpected maneuver by the lead obstacle could result in a collision. If the lateral distance continues to decrease significantly in the next few timesteps, the risk would escalate quickly.  The rapid change in the obstacle’s orientation also raises caution.
