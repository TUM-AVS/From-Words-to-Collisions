### Analysis:

1. **Most Recent Timestep (0.9s):**
   - **Ego Vehicle (ID: 30216):**
     - Position: (397.1757, 364.115)
     - Orientation: -0.3657 rad (~ -20.95°)
     - Velocity: 11.9806 m/s (decelerating)
     - Acceleration: -1.7781 m/s²
   - **Obstacle (ID: 30215):**
     - Position: (417.8307, 362.0337)
     - Orientation: 0.4067 rad (~ 23.3°)
     - Velocity: 17.1559 m/s (decelerating)
     - Acceleration: -6.4286 m/s²

2. **Relative Motion:**
   - **Longitudinal Distance (X-axis):**  
     At 0.9s, the obstacle is ahead of the ego by ~20.655 m (417.8307 - 397.1757).
   - **Lateral Distance (Y-axis):**  
     The obstacle is ~2.0813 m to the side (362.0337 - 364.115). This suggests they are in the same lane (lanelet 176.0) but not perfectly aligned.
   - **Relative Velocity:**  
     The obstacle is decelerating faster (-6.4286 m/s² vs. -1.7781 m/s²), but its speed (17.1559 m/s) is still higher than the ego's (11.9806 m/s). The closing speed is ~5.1753 m/s (17.1559 - 11.9806).

3. **Time to Collision (TTC):**
   - TTC = Longitudinal Distance / Relative Velocity = 20.655 / 5.1753 ≈ 3.99 s.
   - This is a manageable TTC, but the obstacle is in the same lane and closing in.

4. **Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC):**
   - The lateral distance (~2.0813 m) is small but not negligible. If both vehicles maintain their trajectories, the risk of collision is low but not zero.

5. **Trend Analysis:**
   - Over the timesteps, the distance between the ego and the obstacle is decreasing (from ~18.177 m at 0.1s to ~20.655 m at 0.9s). However, the relative velocity is decreasing due to the obstacle's higher deceleration.
   - The obstacle's orientation is changing, indicating it might be turning slightly, but it remains in the same lane.

### Risk Assessment:
- **Overall Risk Score:** 3 (Medium Risk). The TTC is manageable (~4s), and the lateral distance provides some buffer. However, the obstacle is in the same lane and closing in, requiring attention.
