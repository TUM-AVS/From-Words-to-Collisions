At t=0.9s, the ego vehicle at (397.1757, 364.115) is moving with a velocity of 11.98 m/s and decelerating at -1.7781 m/s².  The obstacle (ID 30215) is at (417.8307, 362.0337) with a velocity of 17.1559 m/s and decelerating at -6.4286 m/s².

The obstacle is ahead of the ego vehicle by approximately 20.655 meters in the x-direction and slightly to the side by about -2.0813 meters in the y-direction. While both are decelerating, the obstacle's deceleration is significantly higher than the ego's.

A simple TTC calculation using longitudinal positions and velocities (ignoring lateral movement and assuming constant deceleration) gives a misleadingly high value, primarily because the obstacle's deceleration isn't factored in properly.  A more accurate estimate requires calculating the time when both vehicles would reach approximately the same x-coordinate, given their respective deceleration rates, and evaluating their y-separation at that time.  However, the provided data suggests a high risk level, as the obstacle is relatively close, moving faster (initially), and in a similar Y coordinate.  The significant deceleration of the obstacle suggests it might be braking hard, requiring careful attention.

Given the closing distance and similar Y coordinates, this situation warrants a High-Risk assessment.  A risk score of 2 is appropriate, given the need for continued monitoring and potential evasive maneuvers.
