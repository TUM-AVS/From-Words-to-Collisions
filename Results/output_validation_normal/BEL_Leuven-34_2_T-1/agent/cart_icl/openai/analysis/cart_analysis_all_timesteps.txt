Based on the given scenario details at various time steps, I have assessed potential collision risks primarily focusing on the most recent timestamp (0.9 seconds). Here's a detailed analysis:

### Position Analysis:
- At 0.9 seconds, the Ego vehicle (30216.0) is at position (397.1757, 364.115) and the Obstacle (30215.0) is at position (417.8307, 362.0337).
- Both vehicles are in the same lanelet (176.0).

### Orientation and Motion Trend:
- The Ego vehicle has a consistent orientation near -0.37 radians.
- The Obstacle's orientation has increased from negative to positive, indicating a potential lane change or maneuvering.

### Relative Motion and Distance:
- Longitudinal distance: The obstacle is ahead of the ego vehicle along the x-axis by approximately 20.655 meters.
- Lateral distance: Along the y-axis, the distance between the vehicles is approximately 2.0813 meters.

### Velocity and Acceleration:
- The Ego's deceleration is smoothing out, with a current velocity of 11.9806 m/s and minor deceleration (-1.7781).
- The Obstacle has a velocity of 17.1559 m/s, continuing to decelerate more significantly (-6.4286).

### Time to Collision (TTC) and Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC):
- Relative longitudinal velocity = 17.1559 (Obstacle) - 11.9806 (Ego) = 5.1753 m/s.
- With the obstacle ahead and relative velocity in favor of increasing separation, no immediate collision is likely.
- TTC cannot be computed as the obstacle is ahead, not approaching from behind.

### Conclusion:
Given the obstacle is ahead of the Ego and distancing further, the risk level is assessed as "Negligible Risk" (5). There are no imminent threats in the scenario at hand.
