At the most recent timestep (0.9 seconds), obstacle 30215 is 15.53 meters ahead and 3.83 meters to the left, and moving away from the ego vehicle both longitudinally and laterally.  The longitudinal velocity is only 0.31 m/s, but the continued lateral movement away from the ego (11.97 m/s) indicates decreasing risk. Given the distances and the fact that the obstacle is moving away, there is no immediate risk of collision.
