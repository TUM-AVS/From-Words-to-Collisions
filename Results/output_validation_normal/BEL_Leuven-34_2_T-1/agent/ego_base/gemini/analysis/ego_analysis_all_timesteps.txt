At t=0.9s, obstacle 30215 is located 15.53m in front and 3.83m to the left of the ego vehicle. It is moving away longitudinally at 0.31 m/s and laterally (to the left) at 11.97 m/s.  While the longitudinal motion presents minimal risk, the high lateral velocity suggests the obstacle is rapidly moving out of the ego vehicle's path.  Given the distances and velocities, a collision appears unlikely in the immediate future. The risk level is low (4).
