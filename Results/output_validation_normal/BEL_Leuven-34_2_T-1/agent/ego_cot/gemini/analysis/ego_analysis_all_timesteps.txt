### Safety analysis for timestep 0.9s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 30215
- Distance Risk reason: At 0.9s, the obstacle is located front-left with a longitudinal distance of 15.53m and a lateral distance of 15.53m.  This positioning, combined with the increasing lateral distance and longitudinal distance suggests a negligible risk of collision from a distance perspective.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: The obstacle is moving away both longitudinally and laterally. The continuous increase in distance over the observed time steps further reinforces the low risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5
