### Analysis for Obstacle 30215 at 0.9 seconds:

1. **Position and Direction**:  
   - Obstacle is in the **Front-left** of the ego car.  
   - **Adjusted distances**:  
     - Longitudinal: 15.53 m (moving away)  
     - Lateral: 3.83 m (moving away to the left)  

2. **Relative Velocity**:  
   - Longitudinal: 0.31 m/s (very slow movement away from ego).  
   - Lateral: 11.97 m/s (rapidly moving left away from ego).  

3. **Trajectory Analysis**:  
   - The obstacle is **clearly moving away** from the ego car in both longitudinal and lateral dimensions.  
   - The **longitudinal distance is increasing**, and the **lateral distance is increasing rapidly** (11.97 m/s).  
   - No convergence in either dimension → **no collision risk**.  

4. **Time-to-Collision (TTC)**:  
   - **Longitudinal TTC**: Not applicable (relative velocity is positive, moving away).  
   - **Lateral TTC**: Not applicable (relative velocity is positive, moving away).  
   - Since both components are diverging, **TTC is irrelevant** (no collision trajectory).  

5. **Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC)**:  
   - The **smallest distance** (lateral = 3.83 m) is **already increasing**.  
   - No projected path intersection → **MDC is effectively infinite**.  

6. **Risk Assessment**:  
   - **MDC > 5.0 m** (Low Risk → **Score 4**).  
   - **TTC not applicable** (diverging paths → **Score 5**).  
   - **Final Risk Score**: **5 (Negligible Risk)**.
