Obstacle 30215 Analysis:

Trajectory Analysis:
- Initially, the obstacle was directly in front of the ego vehicle (lateral distance 0.00m) and moving away longitudinally.
- Over the timesteps, the obstacle started moving to the left and further away longitudinally.
- In the most recent timestep (0.9s), the obstacle is Front-Left and moving away in both directions.

TTC Calculation (0.9s):
- Longitudinal TTC: 15.53m / 0.31 m/s ≈ 50.1s (Not applicable as the relative velocity is almost zero and moving away)
- Lateral TTC: 3.83m / 11.97 m/s ≈ 0.32s

MDC Calculation (0.9s):
- Given the trajectories and the fact that the obstacle is moving away in both directions, the MDC is increasing and not a primary concern.  We can estimate it as approximately 3.83m (the lateral distance).

Risk Assessment (0.9s):
- Longitudinal Risk: Negligible (5) - Obstacle moving away.
- Lateral Risk: Medium (3) due to the somewhat low lateral distance and fast-increasing lateral distance over the past time steps, it does not represent immediate risk, because is moving away.

Overall Risk:
- Although the lateral TTC is low (0.32s), the obstacle is moving *away* laterally. The small MDC is not a concern as it's increasing. Therefore, the overall risk is Medium (3).
