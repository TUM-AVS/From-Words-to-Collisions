### Analysis of the Scenario

**Obstacle 30215 Analysis:**

#### Trajectory Review (Consistent Movement Pattern)
Review the movement of Obstacle 30215 from 0.0 seconds to 0.9 seconds:
- The obstacle remained directly in front up to 0.5 seconds, then transitioned to the front-left by 0.6 seconds, with increasing lateral distance.
- Longitudinal distances have consistently increased, indicating the obstacle is moving further away from the ego vehicle, initially with a positive longitudinal relative velocity.
- Lateral distance has increased significantly from 0.0m at 0.5 seconds to 3.83m by 0.9 seconds, indicating divergence to the left.

#### Current (Most Recent) State at 0.9 seconds
- **Adjusted Longitudinal Distance**: 15.53 meters
- **Adjusted Lateral Distance**: 3.83 meters
- **Relative Longitudinal Velocity**: 0.31 m/s (positive indicates the obstacle is moving further from the ego longitudinally)
- **Relative Lateral Velocity**: 11.97 m/s (positive indicates the obstacle is moving away laterally)

#### Risk Calculations:
- **Time-to-Collision (TTC) Longitudinally**:
  - Distance: 15.53 meters
  - Velocity: 0.31 m/s
  - Since velocity indicates divergence (moving away), TTC is not applicable for collision risk longitudinally.
  
- **Time-to-Collision (TTC) Laterally**:
  - Distance: 3.83 meters
  - Velocity: 11.97 m/s
  - Since the lateral velocity indicates divergence (moving away), TTC is not applicable for collision risk laterally.

- **Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC)**:
  - Longitudinally, the obstacle is moving away, putting MDC > 5 meters.
  - Laterally, the obstacle is also diverging laterally, ensuring MDC > 5 meters.

#### Motion Description Confirmation:
- Motion descriptions show the obstacle is consistently moving away both longitudinally and laterally, minimizing any collision risk.

### Risk Assessment:
Based on analyses of both TTC and MDC, Obstacle 30215 does not present a collision or extreme risk due to their substantially increasing distance and diverging trajectory.

**Risk Level**:
- Overall, both the TTC and MDC exceed risk threshold limits, placing Obstacle 30215 at a Negligible Risk (5).
