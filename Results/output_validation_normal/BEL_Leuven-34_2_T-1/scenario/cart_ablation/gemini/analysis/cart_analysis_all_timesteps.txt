At t=0.9s, the ego vehicle is at (397.1757, 364.115) and the obstacle (ID 30215.0) is at (417.8307, 362.0337).  The obstacle is still ahead of the ego vehicle, but the lateral distance is decreasing as the obstacle appears to be changing lanes. While the longitudinal distance is still significant, the continuous decrease in distance combined with the obstacle's lateral movement and the ego's deceleration suggests a potential for an extreme risk scenario in the near future if these trends continue.  More data points are needed to assess with greater certainty.
