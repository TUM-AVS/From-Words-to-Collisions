At t=0.9s, the ego vehicle is at (397.1757, 364.115) and the obstacle (ID 30215.0) is at (417.8307, 362.0337).  The obstacle is still ahead of the ego vehicle, but the x-distance has decreased significantly over the observed time steps. Furthermore, the obstacle's velocity is higher than the ego's, and the obstacle is turning into the ego vehicle's path based on the changing orientation. While not an immediate collision, the rapidly decreasing distance and the obstacle's trajectory suggest an extremely high risk of collision in the next few timesteps if both vehicles maintain their current course and speed.
