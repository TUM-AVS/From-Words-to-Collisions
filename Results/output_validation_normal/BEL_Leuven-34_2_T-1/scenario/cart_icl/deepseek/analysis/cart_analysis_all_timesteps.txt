### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep:  
Here's the evaluation of the obstacle (ID: 30215) according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:
- **Obstacle ID**: 30215  
- **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is in the same lanelet (176.0) as the ego vehicle and has been consistently moving toward the ego vehicle over the previous timesteps. The distance between them has been decreasing (from ~18.18m at 0.1s to ~20.66m at 0.9s).  
- **Distance safety score**: 2 (High Risk)  
- **Time Risk reason**: The relative velocity (obstacle speed - ego speed) is decreasing but still significant (17.1559 - 11.9806 = ~5.18 m/s). The obstacle is decelerating faster than the ego vehicle, but the closing speed remains concerning.  
- **Time safety score**: 2 (High Risk)  
- **Overall Risk score**: 2 (High Risk)  

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:  
1. **Same Lanelet**: Both ego and obstacle are in lanelet 176.0, indicating a shared trajectory.  
2. **Distance Trend**: The distance between them has been decreasing, though not at an alarming rate.  
3. **Velocity & Acceleration**: The obstacle is decelerating faster than the ego, which reduces the risk of collision.  
4. **Projection**: If current trends continue, the obstacle will not collide with the ego but will remain close.
