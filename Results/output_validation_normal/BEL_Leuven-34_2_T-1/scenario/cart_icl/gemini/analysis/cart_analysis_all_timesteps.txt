### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 30210.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is far from ego vehicle and in a different lanelet. Trajectory shows no indication of intersection.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason:  Relative velocity and acceleration suggest no immediate risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 30211.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is far from ego vehicle and in a different lanelet. Trajectory shows no indication of intersection.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Relative velocity and acceleration suggest no immediate risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 30212.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is far from ego vehicle and in a different lanelet. Trajectory shows no indication of intersection.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Relative velocity and acceleration suggest no immediate risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 30213.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is far from ego vehicle and in a different lanelet. Trajectory shows no indication of intersection.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Relative velocity and acceleration suggest no immediate risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 30214.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is far from ego vehicle and in a different lanelet. Trajectory shows no indication of intersection.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Relative velocity and acceleration suggest no immediate risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 30215.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is in the same lanelet as ego vehicle and relatively close.  While the distance is currently safe, the trajectories over the past timesteps indicate the obstacle is rapidly approaching the ego vehicle from behind.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Although the obstacle is moving faster, it's decelerating while the ego vehicle is also decelerating. This reduces the risk, but continued monitoring is needed.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
At the current timestep, there are no imminent collisions. However, obstacle 30215.0, traveling in the same lanelet, poses a potential future risk due to its proximity and higher speed, even though it's decelerating.

### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
  "CollisionObstacles": null,
  "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null,
  "ScenarioAnalysis": {
    "IsCollisionScenario": false,
    "Reasoning": "No obstacle has a risk score of 0 at the current timestep. Although obstacle 30215.0 is approaching rapidly from behind in the same lane, it has not yet reached a collision or extreme risk state."
  }
}
