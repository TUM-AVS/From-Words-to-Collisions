### Obstacle Analysis:

#### Obstacle ID: 30210
- **Distance Risk reason**: Obstacle 30210 is located in lanelet 555.0, maintaining a substantial lateral and longitudinal distance from the ego vehicle's lanelet (176.0), and has followed a trajectory away from the ego vehicle over the past timesteps.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: The obstacle's velocity and acceleration have shown minor increases but remain predictable, with the trajectory moving further from the ego vehicle.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 30211
- **Distance Risk reason**: Obstacle 30211, in lanelet 543.0, maintains a considerable distance from the ego vehicle, with an orientation suggesting no threat to the ego vehicle's path.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: The obstacle's velocity is stable, and trends show no significant approach towards the ego vehicle.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 30212
- **Distance Risk reason**: Residing in lanelet 887.0 (transitioned from 205.0), it shows a lateral distance from lanelet 176.0 and an ongoing trajectory that does not intersect with the ego's path.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: There is an increase in velocity, but given the trajectory, it's still diverging away.
- **Time safety score**: 4
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 30213
- **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is consistently on a path parallel yet distanced from the ego vehicle, residing now in lanelet 205.0.
- **Distance safety score**: 4
- **Time Risk reason**: The velocity steady rise does not suggest an increasing risk given the current trajectory.
- **Time safety score**: 4
- **Overall Risk score**: 4

#### Obstacle ID: 30214
- **Distance Risk reason**: This obstacle stays in lanelet 205.0, progressively shifting further from the ego trajectory.
- **Distance safety score**: 4
- **Time Risk reason**: Despite increasing speed, the risk remains low concerning the ego vehicle's current movement.
- **Time safety score**: 4
- **Overall Risk score**: 4

#### Obstacle ID: 30215
- **Distance Risk reason**: Situated in the same lanelet as the ego (176.0), but with a longitudinal separation and diverging orientation change over time.
- **Distance safety score**: 3
- **Time Risk reason**: High velocity with negative acceleration, though reducing gap indicates potential risk escalation if trends divert.
- **Time safety score**: 2
- **Overall Risk score**: 3

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
None of the obstacles approach a collision situation towards the ego vehicle, with overall movement away or along distinct paths. Primarily, the obstacles show stability in terms of trajectory, while obstacles in the same lanelet (30215) exhibit diminishing speeds but do not present immediate collision threats.
