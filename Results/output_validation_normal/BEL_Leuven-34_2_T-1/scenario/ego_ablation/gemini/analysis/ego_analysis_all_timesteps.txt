Obstacle 30215 is moving away from the ego vehicle both longitudinally and laterally. At the last timestep (0.9 seconds), the obstacle is 15.53 meters ahead and 3.83 meters to the left, and its longitudinal velocity relative to the ego vehicle is only 0.31 m/s.  Although the lateral relative velocity is high (11.97 m/s), the obstacle is moving away from the ego vehicle's path, not towards it. The increasing lateral distance suggests the risk of collision is decreasing.
