Obstacle 30215 is moving away longitudinally from the ego vehicle, but it's also moving away laterally to the left. At the most recent timestep (0.9 seconds), the lateral distance is 3.83 meters and increasing, while the longitudinal distance is 15.53 meters and slightly decreasing. The lateral velocity is high at 11.97 m/s, suggesting a rapid lateral movement. However, there is no indication of an immediate collision.  Given the current trend, a collision is not imminent in the next timestep, but the obstacle's trajectory warrants attention.
