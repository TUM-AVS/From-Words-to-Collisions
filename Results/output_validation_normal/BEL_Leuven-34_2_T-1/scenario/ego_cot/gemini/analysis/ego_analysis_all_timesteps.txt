### Safety analysis for timestep 0.9 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 30215
- Distance Risk reason: At 0.9 seconds, Obstacle 30215 is 15.53m away both longitudinally and laterally, located in the Front-left.  The obstacle is moving away from the ego vehicle both longitudinally and laterally. This large distance and diverging movement indicate a negligible risk related to distance.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Since the obstacle is moving away from the ego vehicle in both directions, the TTC values would be very high or even infinite, indicating no risk of collision in the foreseeable future.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5
