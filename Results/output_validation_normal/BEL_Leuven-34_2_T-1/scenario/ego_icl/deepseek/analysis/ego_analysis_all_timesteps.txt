### Obstacle-by-Obstacle Analysis (Most Recent Timestep: 0.9s)

**Obstacle 30215 (Front-left of ego car)**
- **Adjusted Distances**: 
  - Longitudinal: 15.53 m (increasing over time)
  - Lateral: 3.83 m (increasing over time)
- **Relative Velocities**:
  - Longitudinal: 0.31 m/s (moving away)
  - Lateral: 11.97 m/s (moving away to the left)
- **Motion Description**: 
  - "Obstacle is moving away longitudinally. Obstacle is moving away laterally to the left."
- **Trajectory Analysis**:
  - The obstacle is consistently moving away from the ego vehicle in both longitudinal and lateral directions. The distances are increasing over time, and the relative velocities indicate divergence.
- **TTC Calculation**:
  - Longitudinal TTC: Not applicable (relative velocity is positive, moving away)
  - Lateral TTC: Not applicable (relative velocity is positive, moving away)
- **MDC Calculation**:
  - The minimum distance is the smaller of the two distances, which is lateral (3.83 m). Since both distances are increasing, the MDC is effectively the current lateral distance.
  - MDC = 3.83 m (Low Risk, as 3.0 < MDC ≤ 5.0)
- **Risk Assessment**:
  - No converging trajectories in either dimension.
  - MDC = 3.83 m → Low Risk (4)
  - TTC not applicable (diverging paths) → No Risk (5)
  - **Overall Risk Score**: 4 (Low Risk)

### Trajectory Analysis Across Timesteps
- The obstacle starts directly in front of the ego vehicle (lateral = 0.00 m) but quickly moves to the front-left. 
- Both longitudinal and lateral distances increase over time, with the lateral distance increasing rapidly (from 0.00 m to 3.83 m in 0.9s).
- The relative velocities confirm the obstacle is moving away in both dimensions, with no signs of convergence.

### Conclusion
- No collision (risk score 0) or extreme risk (risk score 1) is present.
- The obstacle is moving away from the ego vehicle in both longitudinal and lateral directions, with no imminent collision risk.
