The ego vehicle and obstacle 30194 are in adjacent lanelets and both are decelerating.  The obstacle's velocity decreases significantly over the provided timeframe, going from 6.63 m/s to 2.57 m/s.  The ego vehicle also decelerates, but less drastically, from 10.60 m/s to 6.61 m/s.

The lateral distance between the ego and the obstacle appears to remain relatively constant, with the ego vehicle consistently to the left of the obstacle. The longitudinal distance, however, is decreasing. It's difficult to definitively assess the risk without knowing the widths of the lanelets and the sizes of the vehicles.  However, given the continuous deceleration and decreasing longitudinal distance, a collision is not imminent within the timeframe provided, but the situation warrants careful monitoring as it could evolve into a higher risk quickly.  There is no information suggesting an immediate or unavoidable collision. Therefore, the risk level appears to be low to medium (3-4) given the available information.
