The ego vehicle and obstacle 30194 are in adjacent lanelets and are both decelerating. While the distance between them is decreasing, they remain in separate lanelets and their trajectories don't appear to intersect within the predicted timeframe.  The lateral distance between the vehicles suggests a low risk of collision.  The provided data doesn't indicate any lane changes or unusual maneuvers.  Therefore, while we should continue monitoring the situation, no immediate collision is imminent.
