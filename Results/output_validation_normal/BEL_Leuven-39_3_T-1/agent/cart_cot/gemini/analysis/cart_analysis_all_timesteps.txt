At t=0.9s, the ego vehicle is at (-25.4826, -333.3818) in lanelet 1069 and the obstacle (ID: 30194) is at (-23.3865, -313.0526) in lanelet 126.  Analyzing the trajectories from previous timesteps, both ego and obstacle are moving in roughly the same direction (orientations are similar), but the ego vehicle is decelerating more rapidly than the obstacle.

**Calculations (at t=0.9s):**

* **Distance:** The distance between the ego and obstacle is approximately sqrt((-25.4826 + 23.3865)^2 + (-333.3818 + 313.0526)^2) = sqrt(4.40 + 406.83) â‰ˆ 20.27 meters.

* **Relative Velocity:** The obstacle's velocity is decreasing slowly, while the ego's velocity decreases at a greater rate. This needs to be considered for TTC.  Approximating relative velocity in x and y based on the last reported values:
    * Relative Velocity X:  Obstacle's X Velocity - Ego's X velocity =  (Difficult to determine precisely without the velocity vector components associated with the orientations, however both are similar so relative velocity in the x axis can be assumed small).
    * Relative Velocity Y: Similarly, this is difficult to determine precisely, we will analyze based on overall speed which shows ego's speed decreasing relative to obstacle's.

* **TTC (Approximated):**
    * Without precise component velocities, we can make a rough estimate from the position and velocity magnitude trends. Given the decreasing velocities, and the positions at the last timestep, a rough estimate for TTC could be > 5 seconds.  This needs careful consideration as it assumes constant deceleration rates, which may not hold true.

* **MDC:**  Approximately 20.27 meters (the distance at t=0.9s).


**Reasoning:**

Although the distance at t=0.9s is moderately large (around 20.27 meters), the lane change of the Ego vehicle requires further attention for a proper analysis and more precise velocity components are needed. While TTC appears high using current data, a lane change by ego while decelerating could change that quickly, especially since there's an indication that both are in adjacent lanelets. Given the ego vehicle is changing lane from lanelet 1069, to 501 and finally to 1071, and also the deceleration rates, additional information is needed to fully assess the situation.

**Risk Assessment:**

Based on available data, the risk level appears medium, but it's important to obtain more precise velocity vectors and lane change information for a comprehensive assessment.
