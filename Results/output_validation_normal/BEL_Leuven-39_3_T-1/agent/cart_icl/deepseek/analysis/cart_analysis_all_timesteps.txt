### Analysis:

1. **Relative Motion and Trajectory**:
   - The ego vehicle (ID: 30200) and the obstacle (ID: 30194) are moving in adjacent lanelets (1069.0 and 126.0 at 0.9s). The lateral distance between them is significant, and their paths do not intersect directly.
   - The ego vehicle is decelerating (acceleration: -2.1555 m/s²) and moving at 6.6096 m/s, while the obstacle is also decelerating (acceleration: -5.0911 m/s²) and moving at 2.5685 m/s. The relative velocity is not indicative of an imminent collision.

2. **Time to Collision (TTC)**:
   - The longitudinal distance between the ego and the obstacle at 0.9s is approximately 20.3292 m (calculated as the Euclidean distance between (-25.4826, -333.3818) and (-23.3865, -313.0526)).
   - The relative velocity is 6.6096 - 2.5685 = 4.0411 m/s (ego is moving faster but decelerating).
   - TTC = Distance / Relative Velocity = 20.3292 / 4.0411 ≈ 5.03 s. This suggests no immediate risk of collision.

3. **Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC)**:
   - Given the lateral separation and non-intersecting trajectories, the MDC remains large enough to avoid collision.

4. **Risk Assessment**:
   - The obstacle (ID: 30194) poses **Low Risk (4)** due to the significant lateral and longitudinal separation, non-intersecting paths, and manageable TTC. No collision or extreme risk is detected.
