At t=0.9s, the ego vehicle is at (-25.4826, -333.3818) in lanelet 1069 with a velocity of 6.6096 and decelerating at -2.1555. The obstacle (ID 30194) is at (-23.3865, -313.0526) in lanelet 126 with a velocity of 2.5685 and decelerating at -5.0911.

The obstacle is approximately 20.33m ahead of the ego vehicle longitudinally and 2.0961m to the right laterally.  Both are decelerating, but the obstacle's deceleration is much greater.  Although they are in different lanelets, the lateral separation is small enough to warrant attention.

Calculating a precise TTC is difficult without knowing the exact future trajectories and lane changes. However, a simplified TTC based on the current longitudinal positions and velocities suggests a TTC of approximately 7.9 seconds (assuming constant deceleration, this might be inaccurate).  Given the different lanelets, the MDC is primarily determined by the lateral distance and is approximately 2.1 meters. While this doesn't indicate an immediate risk, the continuous deceleration of both vehicles and the relatively small lateral distance require further observation to ensure lane changes or other maneuvers don't lead to increased risk in subsequent time steps.  We will classify this as a medium risk for now.
