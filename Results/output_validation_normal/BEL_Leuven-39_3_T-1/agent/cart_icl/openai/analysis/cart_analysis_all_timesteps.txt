### Detailed Analysis Summary:

To evaluate potential collision risks involving Ego vehicle 30200.0 and Obstacle 30194.0, we focus on their relative trajectories, positions, velocities, and accelerations at the most recent timestamp (0.9 seconds), while using previous timestamps to understand their motion trends.

**Trajectory and Motion Analysis:**

- **Ego Vehicle (30200.0):**
  - Position moved from (-26.3635, -341.5527) to (-25.4826, -333.3818) over the course of 0.9 seconds, continuing in lanelet 1069.0.
  - Velocity decreased from 10.5958 m/s to 6.6096 m/s, with consistent deceleration indicating a reduction in speed over time.

- **Obstacle 30194.0:**
  - Position changed from (-23.7217, -316.617) to (-23.3865, -313.0526), indicating slight forward movement within lanelet 126.0.
  - Velocity decreased significantly from 6.6321 m/s to 2.5685 m/s with notable negative acceleration, implying the obstacle is rapidly decelerating.

**Relative Motion Evaluation:**

- **Relative Position and Velocity:**
  - At 0.9 seconds, the obstacle is roughly positioned 20.32 m ahead of the ego vehicle laterally and about 333 - 313 â‰ˆ 20 m in the Y-axis.
  - The relative velocities show the ego vehicle is moving faster, but due to rapid deceleration, it's not aggressively closing the distance in an imminent collision manner.

**TTC and MDC Calculations:**
- **TTC (Time to Collision):**
  - Relative velocity vector shows egos are closing in parallel lanes or positions at different rates of speed. Given the slowdown, the actual TTC is not critical within the monitored period.
  - Estimating a potential lateral shift or change in lane could involve future risk, but it's neither immediate nor calculable using direct linear projections.

- **MDC (Minimum Distance to Collision):**
  - Lateral positions imply a comfortable buffer with differing lanelets and separation.
  - No specific change onward trajectory indicates crossing into each other's path directly.

### Risk Assessment:

Based on these calculations:

- **Collision Risk**: Nonexistent at present; the ego and obstacle positions show they're not on intersecting paths within this timeframe.
- **Overall Risk Score**: Due to the consistent distancing, low relative velocity, and clear lane positioning, the risk remains minimal.

**Conclusion**:

Given these calculations and observations, the overall risk is evaluated as low, with no immediate threat based on evaluated parameters.
