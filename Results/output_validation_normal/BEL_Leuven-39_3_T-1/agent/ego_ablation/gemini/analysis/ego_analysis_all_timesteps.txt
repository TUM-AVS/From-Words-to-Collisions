At t=0.9s, obstacle 30194 is 15.93m directly in front of the ego vehicle and approaching at -4.04 m/s longitudinally.  While the lateral velocity is minimal (0.04 m/s), the persistent negative longitudinal velocity indicates a closing motion. Given the short timeframe and continuous approach, there is a high risk of collision if the current trajectories are maintained.
