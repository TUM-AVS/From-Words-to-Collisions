At t=0.9s, obstacle 30194 is 15.93m directly in front of the ego vehicle and approaching at -4.04 m/s longitudinally.  While the lateral velocity is minimal (0.04 m/s), the persistent negative longitudinal velocity indicates continued approach. Given the decreasing distance and consistent approach, the risk level is escalating and warrants close monitoring. Although not immediately colliding, the current trajectory suggests a high probability of collision in the next few timesteps if the relative velocity isn't reduced. Therefore, obstacle 30194 presents a high risk.
