### Safety analysis for timestep 0.9s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 30194
- Distance Risk reason: The obstacle is 15.93m in front and slightly offset laterally from the ego vehicle.  While the distance is moderate, the continuous approach of the obstacle suggests a potential risk if the current trajectories are maintained.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason:  A constant closing velocity and the decreasing longitudinal distance point towards a potential collision if no evasive action is taken.  We cannot precisely calculate TTC without constant acceleration values, but the trend suggests a TTC within a few seconds.
- Time safety score: 2
- Overall Risk score: 2
