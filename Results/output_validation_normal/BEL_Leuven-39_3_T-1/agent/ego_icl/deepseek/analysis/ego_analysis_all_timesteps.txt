### Obstacle Analysis: 30194

#### Trajectory Analysis:
- **Direction**: Front of ego car (longitudinal alignment)
- **Longitudinal Distance**: Decreasing from 19.50m to 15.93m over 0.9s (closing at ~3.8 m/s average relative velocity)
- **Lateral Distance**: Consistently 0.00m (exact alignment, same lane)
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal ~-3.8 m/s (approaching), lateral ~0.05 m/s (negligible drift)
- **Acceleration**: Longitudinal ~-0.2 m/s² (slightly increasing closing speed), lateral ~-2.5 m/s² (minor correction)

#### Risk Calculations (Most Recent Timestep: 0.9s):
1. **Time-to-Collision (TTC)**:
   - Longitudinal TTC = Distance / |Relative Velocity| = 15.93 / 4.04 ≈ **3.94s**  
   - Lateral TTC = N/A (lateral velocity negligible)
   - **TTC Risk**: 4 (Low Risk, 3.0 < TTC ≤ 5.0s)

2. **Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC)**:
   - Since obstacle is longitudinally aligned (lateral = 0.00m), MDC = longitudinal distance = **15.93m**  
   - **MDC Risk**: 5 (No Risk, MDC > 5.0m)

3. **Overall Risk**:
   - Prioritize the higher risk (lower score) between TTC (4) and MDC (5).  
   - **Final Risk Score**: 4 (Low Risk)  

#### Reasoning:
- No collision or extreme risk observed. The obstacle is closing longitudinally but at a safe distance (>15m) with moderate TTC (~4s).  
- Lateral alignment (0.00m) is stable with negligible drift velocity.
