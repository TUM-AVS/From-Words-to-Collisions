Obstacle 30194 is in front of the ego vehicle and approaching longitudinally.  The lateral distance remains at 0.00 m across all timesteps, indicating the obstacle is likely in the same lane. The longitudinal distance decreases consistently across the timesteps, confirming the closing motion.

At the last timestep (0.9 seconds), the longitudinal distance is 15.93 meters and the relative longitudinal velocity is -4.04 m/s.

TTC Calculation:
TTC = distance / relative_velocity = 15.93 m / 4.04 m/s â‰ˆ 3.94 seconds

MDC Calculation:
Since the obstacle is directly in front, MDC is essentially the longitudinal distance at the last timestep, which is 15.93m.

Risk Assessment:
Based on TTC (3.94s) the risk is Low (4).
Based on MDC (15.93m) the risk is Negligible (5).

Overall Risk: Since we prioritize the higher risk (lower score), the overall risk for Obstacle 30194 is Low (4).
