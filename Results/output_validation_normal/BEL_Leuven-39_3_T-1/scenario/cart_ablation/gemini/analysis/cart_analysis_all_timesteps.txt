At t=0.9s, the ego vehicle is at (-25.48, -333.38) in lanelet 1069, and the obstacle is at (-23.39, -313.05) in lanelet 126.  While the lanelets are different, the y-coordinates (longitudinal positions) are converging and the x-coordinates (lateral positions) are relatively close.  Combined with the decreasing velocities, this suggests a possible collision or near miss if the trend continues. However, without lanelet geometry information or vehicle dimensions, we can't definitively say a collision is imminent or unavoidable. We'll classify this as an extreme risk (1) due to the proximity and converging trajectories.
