At t=0.9s, the ego vehicle is at (-25.48, -333.38) in lanelet 1069, while the obstacle (ID 30194) is at (-23.39, -313.05) in lanelet 126.  While the lanelets differ, the y-coordinates suggest a potential lane change by either vehicle, placing them on a possible collision course. The distance between them is decreasing over time, and their velocities are also decreasing, but not rapidly enough to eliminate the risk. The change in lanelet for the ego vehicle between 0.5s and 0.6s, and the obstacle between 0.7s and 0.8s supports this concern.  The relatively small difference in y-coordinates indicates a high risk of collision. Due to the lane changes and closing distance I've classified this as Extreme Risk (1).
