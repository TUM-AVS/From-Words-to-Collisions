### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:
- **Obstacle ID**: 30194.0  
  - **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is in a different lanelet (126.0) compared to the ego vehicle (1069.0). The lateral distance between them is significant, and their trajectories are not converging. Over the previous timesteps, the obstacle has been moving away from the ego vehicle's path.  
  - **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)  
  - **Time Risk reason**: The obstacle is decelerating rapidly (acceleration ~ -5.0911) while the ego vehicle is also decelerating but at a slower rate. The relative velocity is decreasing, and the obstacle is moving away longitudinally.  
  - **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)  
  - **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low Risk)  

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. **Lanelet Analysis**: The ego vehicle and obstacle are in different lanelets (1069.0 vs. 126.0), indicating no immediate overlap in paths.  
2. **Trajectory Trends**: Over the timesteps, the obstacle's position is diverging from the ego vehicle's path, and both are decelerating.  
3. **Relative Motion**: The obstacle is moving away both laterally and longitudinally, reducing collision risk.  
4. **Acceleration Patterns**: Both vehicles are decelerating, with the obstacle decelerating more aggressively, further reducing risk.
