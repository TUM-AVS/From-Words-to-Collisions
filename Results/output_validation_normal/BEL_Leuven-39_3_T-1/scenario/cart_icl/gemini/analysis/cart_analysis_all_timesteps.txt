### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
No obstacle has a risk score of 0, so this is not a collision scenario. While some obstacles are moderately close, their trajectories and relative velocities suggest they are not on a direct collision course with the ego vehicle within the near future.

### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
  "CollisionObstacles": null,
  "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null,
  "ScenarioAnalysis": {
    "IsCollisionScenario": false,
    "Reasoning": "No obstacle poses an immediate collision risk (score 0). Some obstacles are in moderate proximity, but their trajectories and relative velocities do not indicate an imminent collision."
