Obstacle 30194 is approaching the ego vehicle head-on with a decreasing longitudinal distance over each timestep. At the most recent timestep (0.9 seconds), the obstacle is 15.93 meters away and closing at a relative longitudinal speed of -4.04 m/s.  While the lateral distance is currently zero, the lateral relative velocity is small (0.04 m/s) and the consistent negative lateral acceleration suggests the obstacle might be slightly correcting its trajectory away from the ego vehicle.  However, the primary concern is the longitudinal motion. Assuming constant velocity, a collision could occur within approximately 4 seconds.  This represents a high risk, but not necessarily an *extreme* risk *yet*, as there is still time for evasive maneuvers.
