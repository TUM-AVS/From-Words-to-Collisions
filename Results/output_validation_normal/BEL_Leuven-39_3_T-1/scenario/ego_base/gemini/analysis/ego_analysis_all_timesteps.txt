Obstacle 30194 is approaching the ego vehicle head-on, as indicated by the negative longitudinal relative velocity (-4.04 m/s). The longitudinal distance is decreasing rapidly (15.93m at the last timestep). While lateral distance is currently zero, indicating perfect alignment or an unknown lateral position, the small, slightly positive lateral relative velocity (0.04 m/s) suggests a minimal lateral movement. Given the closing speed and decreasing distance, a collision is likely if the current trajectory is maintained.
