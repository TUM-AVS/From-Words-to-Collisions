### Safety analysis for timestep 0.9 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 30194
- Distance Risk reason:  At 0.9 seconds, Obstacle 30194 is 15.93m longitudinally and laterally away from the ego vehicle and approaching with a longitudinal relative velocity of -4.04 m/s. While the current distance poses no immediate threat, the continuous approach and negative longitudinal velocity suggest a decreasing distance.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason:  Assuming constant velocity (as we lack explicit TTC information and acceleration data is inconsistent), a rough TTC estimate is 15.93m / 4.04 m/s â‰ˆ 3.94 seconds. While this appears safe, the lateral movement is unclear due to near zero lateral velocity and fluctuating lateral acceleration. This uncertainty, compounded by the continuous longitudinal approach, presents a moderate risk. Further, slight variations in velocity or trajectory could significantly reduce the TTC.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3

{
    "CollisionObstacle": null,
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null,
    "IsCollisionScenario": false,
    "Justification": "No immediate collision is detected. However, Obstacle 30194 is approaching the ego vehicle with a moderate risk level (Overall Risk Score 3), requiring monitoring due to the uncertain lateral movement and continuously decreasing longitudinal distance."
