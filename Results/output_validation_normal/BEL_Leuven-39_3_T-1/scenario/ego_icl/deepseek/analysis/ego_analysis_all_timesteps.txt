### Obstacle-by-Obstacle Analysis (Most Recent Timestep: 0.9s)

#### **Obstacle 30194** (Front of ego car)
- **Adjusted Distances**: 
  - Longitudinal: 15.93 m (raw: 15.93 m)
  - Lateral: 0.00 m (raw: 0.00 m)
- **Relative Velocity**: 
  - Longitudinal: -4.04 m/s (approaching ego)
  - Lateral: 0.04 m/s (minimal lateral movement)
- **Relative Acceleration**: 
  - Longitudinal: -0.23 m/s² (slight deceleration)
  - Lateral: -2.93 m/s² (lateral movement stabilizing)
- **Motion Description**: "Obstacle is driving toward the ego car longitudinally. Exact lateral alignment."

---

### **Trajectory Analysis (0.1s to 0.9s)**
- The obstacle is consistently aligned laterally (0.00m) and closing longitudinally at ~4 m/s.
- Longitudinal distance decreases from 19.50m to 15.93m over 0.8s (~3.57 m/s average closing speed).
- Lateral velocity is negligible (~0.05 m/s), and lateral acceleration is negative (correcting drift).

---

### **Risk Metrics Calculation**
1. **Time-to-Collision (TTC)**:
   - Longitudinal TTC = Distance / |Relative Velocity| = 15.93 / 4.04 ≈ **3.94 seconds**.
   - Lateral TTC = N/A (lateral distance stable/increasing due to negative acceleration).

2. **Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC)**:
   - Since the obstacle is directly ahead (lateral = 0.00m), MDC is the longitudinal distance: **15.93m**.

---

### **Risk Assessment**
- **TTC (3.94s)**: Falls in **Low Risk (4)** (3.0 < TTC ≤ 5.0).
- **MDC (15.93m)**: Falls in **No Risk (5)** (MDC > 5.0m).
- **Overall Risk**: Prioritize the higher risk (lower score) → **Low Risk (4)**.

---

### **Collision Scenario Determination**
- No obstacle has a risk score of 0 (collision) or 1 (extreme risk).
- The closest obstacle (30194) is 15.93m away with a TTC of 3.94s, which is **Low Risk**.
