Obstacle Analysis:

Obstacle 30194:

Trajectory Analysis: Across the provided timesteps (0.0s to 0.9s), Obstacle 30194 consistently remains in front of the ego vehicle and is moving closer.  The lateral distance remains at 0.0m indicating perfect longitudinal alignment.  The longitudinal distance decreases steadily from 19.50m to 15.93m. This confirms the motion description "Obstacle is driving toward the ego car longitudinally."

TTC Calculation (at t=0.9s):
Longitudinal TTC = distance / relative_velocity = 15.93m / 4.04 m/s ≈ 3.94 seconds.

Lateral TTC is not applicable as lateral velocity ≈ 0m/s implies constant/no convergence laterally.

MDC Calculation (at t=0.9s): Given the obstacle is directly in front, MDC is effectively the longitudinal distance which is the smaller of the two distances.  The lateral alignment (0.0m) and the motion description don't indicate a collision. Therefore, MDC ≈ 15.93m.

Risk Assessment (at t=0.9s):

Longitudinal Risk: Based on TTC of ≈ 3.94s, the longitudinal risk is "Medium Risk" (3).
Lateral Risk: As the obstacle maintains perfect longitudinal alignment, and the lateral velocity is negligible, there's currently no lateral risk. This assumes the obstacle will not shift laterally abruptly.
Overall Risk: Taking the higher risk assessment of the two components, the overall risk is "Medium Risk" (3).

Collision Scenario Determination:

Since no obstacle has a risk score of 0 (collision) or 1 (extreme risk), this is NOT a collision scenario.
