### Obstacle-by-Obstacle Analysis

#### Obstacle 30194 Analysis:

**Trajectory Analysis Across Timesteps:**

- Over the span from 0.1s to 0.9s, obstacle 30194's longitudinal distance decreases from 19.50 m to 15.93 m, indicating it is approaching the ego vehicle. The lateral distance remains effectively 0.00 m throughout, affirming perfectly aligned paths longitudinally.

**Most Recent Timestep (0.9 seconds):**

- **Relative Position & Motion:** 
  - Adjusted longitudinal distance: 15.93 m
  - Adjusted lateral distance: Exact alignment (0.00 m)
  - Relative velocity: longitudinal -4.04 m/s, which means the obstacle is approaching the ego vehicle.
  - Relative lateral velocity: 0.04 m/s, contributing minimally to any potential change in lateral distance.

**Risk Assessment Calculations:**

- **Time-to-Collision (TTC):**
  - Since the obstacle is directly in front and closing in, only longitudinal TTC is considered: 
  - TTC (Longitudinal) = 15.93 m / 4.04 m/s = 3.94 seconds

- **Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC):**
  - Since both lateral and longitudinal trajectories are almost perfectly aligned, we consider the longitudinal path primarily.
  - The current longitudinal distance is 15.93 m, and given the aligned lateral distance (0.00 m), the longitudinal trajectory will impact future MDC while closing in.
  - Therefore, MDC is managed primarily by longitudinal trajectory which decreases towards 0 if path maintained, but provides no immediate risk below 10m considering the approaching rate.

**Risk Scores:**
- TTC = 3.94 seconds → Medium Risk (3)
- MDC > 5 meters currently, decreasing but far from problematic thresholds → No Immediate Risk Change beyond Medium Risk (3)

**Conclusion:**

- The lowest risk score for this scenario is Medium Risk (3), based on the approach rate and calculated TTC that exceeds the thresholds for higher immediacy of risk.
  
- There are no extreme conditions like imminent collision within 0.5s or MDC sharply reducing under 0.5m imminently, given current known rates. No collision or extreme risk is assessed.
