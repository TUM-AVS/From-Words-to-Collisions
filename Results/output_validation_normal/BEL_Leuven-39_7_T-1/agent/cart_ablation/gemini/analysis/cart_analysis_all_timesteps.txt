The ego vehicle is decelerating significantly throughout the provided timeframe.  Obstacle 30193 is stationary and poses no immediate threat. Obstacle 30194 is moving slowly and also decelerating.  While the y-coordinates of the ego vehicle and Obstacle 30194 appear to be converging, the x-coordinate difference suggests they are in different lanes (lane 1070 vs 1071 and then 501 for ego). The change in ego's lanelet from 1071 to 501 in the last timestep could indicate a lane change maneuver by the ego vehicle.  Given the available data, a collision doesn't seem imminent within the next second, but continued monitoring is required, especially considering the rapid deceleration of the ego vehicle and the lane change. The lack of precise lane geometry makes a definitive assessment of lateral separation challenging.
