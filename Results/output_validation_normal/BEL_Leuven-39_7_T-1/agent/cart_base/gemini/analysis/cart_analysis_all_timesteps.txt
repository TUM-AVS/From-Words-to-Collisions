Obstacle 30193 is stationary and far from the ego vehicle, posing no immediate risk. Obstacle 30194 is in a neighboring lane (1070) to the ego vehicle (initially 1071, then 501).  While the ego vehicle's velocity is decreasing, it is still moving significantly faster than Obstacle 30194.  The y-coordinates of both are converging, but the x-coordinate difference remains relatively stable around -2.  This suggests a possible lane change maneuver by the ego vehicle, but with insufficient information to determine a definitive risk.  No collision is imminent, but further observation is needed.
