Here's a breakdown of the collision analysis at t=0.9s:

**Ego Vehicle State at t=0.9s:**

* Position: (-25.798, -336.312)
* Velocity: 4.1065 (Units assumed to be m/s)
* Acceleration: -1.5247  (Units assumed to be m/s^2)
* Lanelet: 501.0 This lane change suggests the ego vehicle might be actively avoiding a collision

**Obstacle States at t=0.9s:**

* **Obstacle 30193:**
    * Position: (-23.3307, -312.4706)
    * Velocity: 0.0
    * Acceleration: 0.0
    * Lanelet: 126.0
* **Obstacle 30194:**
    * Position: (-24.1373, -320.7465)
    * Velocity: 0.8111
    * Acceleration: -0.5485
    * Lanelet: 1070.0

**Analysis:**

1. **Obstacle 30193:** This obstacle is stationary and poses no immediate threat. While the y-coordinate difference is significant (~24 meters), the x-coordinate difference is only about ~2.5 meters. Given that the ego vehicle is decelerating and changing lanes, it's highly probable it's maneuvering to avoid this obstacle. This suggests a prior high risk situation that is now mitigating. Risk Score: 3 (Medium Risk).

2. **Obstacle 30194:**  This obstacle is moving slowly and also decelerating. Its y-coordinate is closer to the ego vehicle (~16 meters) than obstacle 30193, and the x-coordinate difference is even smaller, around ~1.7 meters.  The ego vehicle's lane change to 501, combined with its deceleration, strongly implies an avoidance maneuver targeted primarily at this obstacle. Risk Score: 2 (High Risk)


**Overall Assessment and Prediction:**

The ego vehicle seems to be successfully executing an avoidance maneuver.  While Obstacle 30194 presents a higher risk due to its proximity and the ego vehicle's actions, a collision is not imminent. The ego vehicle's deceleration and lateral movement suggest it should be able to create sufficient separation. It is unlikely a collision will happen with either vehicle if this trajectory is maintained. However, Obstacle 30194 deserves close monitoring because of smaller distances.
