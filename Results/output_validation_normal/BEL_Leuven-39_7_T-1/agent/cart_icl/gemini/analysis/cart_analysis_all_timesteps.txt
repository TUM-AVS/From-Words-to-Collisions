At t=0.9s, the ego vehicle is at (-25.798, -336.312) and has transitioned to lanelet 501.  It's decelerating at -1.5247 m/sÂ². Let's analyze the obstacles:

* **Obstacle 30193:** Stationary at (-23.3307, -312.4706) in lanelet 126.  This obstacle poses no immediate threat due to the significant lateral and longitudinal separation, as well as the ego vehicle's deceleration. Risk: **Negligible (5)**

* **Obstacle 30194:**  At (-24.1373, -320.7465) in lanelet 1070, moving slowly at 0.8111 m/s and decelerating.  While closer than 30193, the lateral separation and differing lanelets suggest low risk. We need to examine the relative motion and lanelet relationship more closely to definitively rule out any potential future conflicts, particularly given the ego vehicle's lane change. Risk: **Low (4)**


Based on the provided data, a detailed TTC calculation isn't possible without knowing the precise lanelet geometries and vehicle dimensions. However, considering the positions, velocities, and decelerations at the last timestep (0.9s), no immediate collision is imminent.  Further analysis with lanelet information is required for a more precise risk assessment.
