Upon evaluating the scenario at 0.9 seconds, I focused on the relative motion of obstacles in comparison to the ego vehicle at this final timestep:

### Assessments:

**Obstacle 30193**:
- Position: (-23.3307, -312.4706)
- The obstacle remains stationary with zero velocity and acceleration.
- Located in a different lanelet (126.0) than the ego vehicle.
- The relative position to the ego suggests a lateral distance that does not present any immediate risk.
- **Risk Level**: Negligible Risk (5)

**Obstacle 30194**:
- Position: (-24.1373, -320.7465)
- Velocity reducing toward a stop: 0.8111 m/s with negative acceleration (-0.5485).
- Positioned in lanelet 1070.0, closely within proximity to the ego's lanelet (1071.0), but not in the same exact path.
- Trend analysis shows consistent decrease in velocity while maintaining a similar path.
- At the closest approach, the lateral offset doesn't suggest an immediate collision threat but does warrant attention due to relative paths and decreasing velocity.
- **TTC is not meaningful as velocities are diminishing and not closing in rapidly.**
- **Risk Level**: Medium Risk (3)

### Summary

Based on evaluated trajectories and relative movements:

- **Obstacle 30193** has no risk as it remains stationary and is in a different lanelet than the ego vehicle.
- **Obstacle 30194** presents a **Medium Risk** (score 3), due to the lane proximity, though its reducing speed minimizes the direct crash threat.
