At t=0.9s, Obstacle 30193 is 19.46m ahead of the ego vehicle, approaching at -4.11 m/s longitudinally.  Obstacle 30194 is closer at 11.15m ahead, approaching slower at -3.30 m/s longitudinally. Both are directly in front (0 lateral offset). While both obstacles are approaching, they are not imminently close to collision at this timestep. Given the current speeds and distances, there are several seconds of reaction time. Thus, they are not considered high risk at this moment.
