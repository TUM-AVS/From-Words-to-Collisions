### Safety analysis for timestep 0.9s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

**Assumptions and Clarifications:**

* Since adjusted distances (adjusted_d_long, adjusted_d_lat) are not provided, raw distance values (DTClong, DTClat) will be used for this analysis.  This is not ideal and may lead to less precise risk assessments.  It is *strongly* recommended to include adjusted distances in future data for more accurate analysis.
* TTC calculations will be simplified due to the lack of explicit ego vehicle motion data.  We'll assume the ego vehicle maintains its current velocity.  More accurate TTC would require ego acceleration data.  We'll approximate TTClong as DTClong / Vrel_long, only when Vrel_long is significantly non-zero. If it's close to zero, we assume a large TTC as there's no rapid closing in the scenario.
* Lateral TTC (TTClat) will be disregarded and its safety score assigned as 5 because there's no immediate lateral risk based on the provided relative speeds and positions of the obstacles. There's no indication of a lateral closing movement that would be a threat.
* A simplified risk assessment logic is applied based on distance and relative velocity due to lack of more sophisticated motion prediction information.


### Obstacle Analysis:

**- Obstacle ID: 30193**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is at 19.46m longitudinally, which is a safe distance. Lateral distance is also large (19.46m). Relative velocity is negative.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Relative longitudinal velocity is -4.11 m/s.  Assuming constant velocity, approximate TTClong is 19.46/4.11 ~= 4.7s.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4


**- Obstacle ID: 30194**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is at 11.15m longitudinally, which is moderately far.  Lateral distance is also moderate (11.15m). Relative velocity is negative.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: Relative longitudinal velocity is -3.30 m/s. Assuming constant velocity, approximate TTClong is 11.15/3.30 ~= 3.4s.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3
