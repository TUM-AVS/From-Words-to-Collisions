At t=0.9s:

Obstacle 30193:
- Longitudinal distance: 19.46m
- Lateral distance: 0.00m
- Longitudinal relative velocity: -4.11 m/s (approaching)
- Lateral relative velocity: 0.00 m/s

Trajectory Analysis: This obstacle has been consistently in front of the ego vehicle and in the same lane (lateral distance ≈ 0), with a decreasing longitudinal distance across all timesteps.  It is moving towards the ego vehicle.

TTC (longitudinal): 19.46m / 4.11 m/s ≈ 4.73s (Low Risk)
MDC:  Since the lateral distance is effectively zero and the obstacle is directly ahead, the MDC is primarily determined by the longitudinal distance, which is 19.46m. This also indicates a Low Risk (4).

Overall Risk Score: 4 (Low Risk)


Obstacle 30194:
- Longitudinal distance: 11.15m
- Lateral distance: 0.00m
- Longitudinal relative velocity: -3.30 m/s (approaching)
- Lateral relative velocity: 0.00 m/s

Trajectory Analysis: Similar to Obstacle 30193, this obstacle is consistently in front of the ego vehicle, in the same lane, and approaching.

TTC (longitudinal): 11.15m / 3.30 m/s ≈ 3.38s (Medium Risk)
MDC: The MDC is primarily the longitudinal distance of 11.15m (Medium Risk).

Overall Risk Score: 3 (Medium Risk)
