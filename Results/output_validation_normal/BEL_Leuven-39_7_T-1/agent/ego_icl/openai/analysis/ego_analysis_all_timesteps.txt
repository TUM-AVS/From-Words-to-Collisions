### Obstacle-by-Obstacle Analysis

**Obstacle 30193:**
- **Position:** Front
- **At 0.9 seconds:**
  - **Adjusted Longitudinal Distance:** Approximately 19.46 meters (indicative, same as raw since no adjusted values were provided)
  - **Adjusted Lateral Distance:** 0.00 meters
  - **Relative Velocity Longitudinal:** -4.11 m/s (approaching)
  - **Relative Acceleration Longitudinal:** 0.16 m/s² (slightly decelerating compared to earlier speed)
- **Trajectory Analysis:**
  - The obstacle is consistently approaching over all time steps, moving from roughly 24.39 meters to 19.46 meters over 0.9 seconds.
- **TTC:** 
  - Using the longitudinal values: TTC = 19.46 / 4.11 ≈ 4.73 seconds
- **MDC:**
  - The obstacle maintains exact lateral alignment, with no component in lateral direction, but with a closing longitudinal component which doesn't indicate an imminent collision.
  - With current relative velocity, MDC on the longitudinal front is still > 7 meters.

**Conclusion:**  
TTC indicates a low risk situation approaching moderation (TTC ≈ 4.73s); however, given the distances involved, and no rapid reduction or alarming acceleration, risk is minimal for involvement. The primary concern is continued closing, but under controlled deceleration.

- **Risk Score:** 4 (Low Risk)

**Obstacle 30194:**
- **Position:** Front
- **At 0.9 seconds:**
  - **Adjusted Longitudinal Distance:** Approximately 11.15 meters
  - **Adjusted Lateral Distance:** 0.00 meters
  - **Relative Velocity Longitudinal:** -3.30 m/s (approaching)
  - **Relative Acceleration Longitudinal:** 0.11 m/s² (slightly decelerating compared to earlier speed)
- **Trajectory Analysis:**
  - The obstacle is on a convergent path, consistently moving closer over timesteps, from approximately 15.16 meters to 11.15 meters.
- **TTC:**
  - Using the longitudinal values: TTC = 11.15 / 3.30 ≈ 3.38 seconds
- **MDC:**
  - Same straight alignment with no lateral movement signals paramount importance of longitudinal distance.
  - Rapidly converging but within a predicable range, not dangerous yet.

**Conclusion:**
The earlier time gap offers a moderate but manageable threat potential. More reduction in relative velocity gives control to smooth any impending threat.

- **Risk Score:** 3 (Medium Risk)
