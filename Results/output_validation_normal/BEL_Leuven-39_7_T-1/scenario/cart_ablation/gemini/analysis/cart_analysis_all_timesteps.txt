At t=0.9s, Ego (30200.0) is in lanelet 501.0 and decelerating.

Obstacle 30193.0 is stationary and far from Ego, posing no immediate risk.

Obstacle 30194.0 is in lanelet 1070.0 and also decelerating.  While the provided data doesn't give lanelet geometries, the positions and similar orientations suggest Ego has moved from lanelet 1071.0 to 501.0 (likely adjacent to 1070.0 where 30194.0 is located and slowing down) increasing the risk of a potential collision or near miss in the near future if both continue on their current trajectories.  However, at this *specific* moment, they are not in immediate danger of collision. Thus, no obstacle presents an extreme (1) or collision (0) risk.

```json
{
  "CollisionObstacles": [],
  "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null,
  "ScenarioAnalysis": {
    "IsCollisionScenario": false,
    "Reasoning": "No obstacle presents an immediate collision risk at t=0.9s.  Obstacle 30194.0 in lanelet 1070.0 requires monitoring due to Ego's lane change and both vehicles decelerating, posing a potential future risk."
  }
