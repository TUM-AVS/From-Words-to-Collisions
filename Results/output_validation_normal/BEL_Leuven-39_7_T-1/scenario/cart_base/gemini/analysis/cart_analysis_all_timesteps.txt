At t=0.9s, Ego (30200.0) is in lanelet 501.0 and decelerating.

Obstacle 30193.0 is stationary and far from Ego, posing no immediate risk.

Obstacle 30194.0 is in lanelet 1070.0 and also decelerating.  While the provided data doesn't give lanelet geometries, the positions and similar orientations suggest Ego has likely changed lanes and is now close to and potentially converging with Obstacle 30194.0.  Further information on lanelet geometry and vehicle sizes is needed to definitively determine an extreme risk, but based on the provided trajectory information, there is a potential for a high risk scenario developing.  However, given no collision has occurred yet, nor is it explicitly stated as unavoidable with the given information, we classify this as high risk but not extreme risk yet.

```json
{
    "CollisionObstacles": [],
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null,
    "ScenarioAnalysis": {
        "IsCollisionScenario": false,
        "Reasoning": "No collision occurred. Obstacle 30194.0 presents a potential high risk due to proximity and converging trajectories with Ego after the lane change, but more information is needed to confirm extreme risk."
    }
}
