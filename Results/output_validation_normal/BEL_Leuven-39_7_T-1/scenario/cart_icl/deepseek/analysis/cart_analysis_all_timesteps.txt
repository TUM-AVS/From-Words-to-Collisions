### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep:

### Obstacle Analysis:
#### Obstacle ID: 30193.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is stationary and located at (-23.3307, -312.4706), which is far from the ego vehicle's current position (-25.798, -336.312). The distance has been increasing over time as the ego vehicle moves away.
- **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- **Time Risk reason**: Since the obstacle is stationary and the ego vehicle is moving away, there is no risk of collision.
- **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- **Overall Risk score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)

#### Obstacle ID: 30194.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is moving towards the ego vehicle but is still at a significant distance (-24.1373, -320.7465) vs (-25.798, -336.312). The distance has been decreasing but remains manageable.
- **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
- **Time Risk reason**: The obstacle's velocity (0.8111) is much lower than the ego's (4.1065), and both are decelerating. The relative velocity suggests a low collision risk.
- **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
- **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low Risk)

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. **Obstacle 30193.0**: Stationary and far from the ego vehicle. No collision risk.
2. **Obstacle 30194.0**: Moving towards the ego but at a low speed and decelerating. The distance is still safe.
3. **Ego Vehicle**: Decelerating and maintaining a safe distance from both obstacles.
4. **Conclusion**: No immediate or high-risk collision scenario.
