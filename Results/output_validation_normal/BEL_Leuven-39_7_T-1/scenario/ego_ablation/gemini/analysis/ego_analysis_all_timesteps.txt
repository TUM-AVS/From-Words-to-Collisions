Obstacle 30194 is at a longitudinal distance of 11.15m and closing at a relative longitudinal velocity of -3.30 m/s. While the relative longitudinal velocity is decreasing, the short distance poses a significant risk. Obstacle 30193, though further away at 19.46m, is also approaching with a relative longitudinal velocity of -4.11 m/s.  The lateral distance for both obstacles is zero, indicating they are directly in front of the ego vehicle.  Given the short distance and closing velocities, there is a high risk of collision with obstacle 30194 in the immediate future if the ego vehicle does not decelerate or maneuver.

  "ScenarioAnalysis": {
    "IsCollisionScenario": false,
    "Reasoning": "Obstacle 30194 poses an extreme risk due to its close proximity (11.15m) and closing velocity (-3.30 m/s) relative to the ego vehicle. While not an immediate collision, the risk is high enough to warrant immediate action. Obstacle 30193 is also approaching but is further away, representing a high, but not extreme risk currently."
