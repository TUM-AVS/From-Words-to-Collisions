At t=0.9s, Obstacle 30193 is 19.46m in front of the ego vehicle, approaching at -4.11 m/s longitudinally. Obstacle 30194 is even closer at 11.15m, approaching at -3.30 m/s longitudinally. Both obstacles present a potential risk, but 30194 poses a more immediate concern due to its proximity. Although the relative longitudinal velocities suggest both vehicles are slowing down, the closing distances indicate a potential collision if the trend continues.  Obstacle 30194 is considered high risk due to its proximity and closing velocity, while 30193 is considered medium risk as it is further away but still approaching. Neither obstacle is deemed an immediate (extreme or collision) risk at this timestep, as there's still a small time buffer for evasive maneuvers. However, prompt action is needed to mitigate the potential collision with 30194.

**Risk Levels and Definitions:**
<Collision (Score: 0)>: Actual collision has occurred or is unavoidable within the next timestep.
<Extreme Risk (Score: 1)>: Immediate collision or very high likelihood of impact. Urgent action is required.
<High Risk (Score: 2)>: Close to collision or highly probable collision path. Needs prompt attention and quick manoeuvring.
<Medium Risk (Score: 3)>: Moderate collision risk but manageable with timely reactions and proper strategies.
<Low Risk (Score: 4)>: Minimal collision risk. The situation is controllable with sufficient time to react.
<Negligible Risk (Score: 5)>: No significant collision risk. Obstacles are either moving away or far enough not to interfere.
