### Safety analysis for timestep 0.9 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 30193**
- Distance Risk reason:  Obstacle 30193 is in the Front of the ego car at a longitudinal distance of 19.46m and a lateral distance of 19.46m.  While the distance is moderate, its continuous approach towards the ego vehicle longitudinally, combined with the unknown lateral movement due to "Exact lateral alignment or unknown case", raises concern.
- Distance safety score: 3 (Medium Risk)
- Time Risk reason: TTC cannot be reliably calculated as the lateral velocity is zero and the information provided doesn't allow for accurate prediction of future lateral movement. The negative longitudinal relative velocity indicates ongoing approach. Given the uncertain lateral movement, the time-based risk is medium, pending further lateral movement data.
- Time safety score: 3 (Medium Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 3 (Medium Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 30194**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 30194 is closer than Obstacle 30193, with longitudinal and lateral distances of 11.15m. This closer proximity, along with the "Exact lateral alignment or unknown case," makes it a higher risk.  The longitudinal approach increases the risk.
- Distance safety score: 2 (High Risk)
- Time Risk reason: Similar to 30193, TTC calculation is unreliable due to zero lateral velocity and unknown future lateral movement. The shorter distance coupled with continued longitudinal approach represents an elevated risk.
- Time safety score: 2 (High Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 2 (High Risk)


### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
  "CollisionObstacle": null,
  "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null,
  "IsCollisionScenario": false,
  "Justification": "Although obstacles are approaching longitudinally, there is no immediate collision detected in the given timeframe (0.9s). The uncertainties around lateral movements prevent definitive collision predictions. Continuous monitoring and potential evasive maneuvers are recommended, particularly for Obstacle 30194, which poses a higher risk due to its proximity."
