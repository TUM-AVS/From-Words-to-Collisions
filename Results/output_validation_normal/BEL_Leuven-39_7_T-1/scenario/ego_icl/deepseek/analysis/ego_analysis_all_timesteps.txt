### Obstacle-by-Obstacle Analysis (Most Recent Timestep: 0.9s)

#### **Obstacle 30193**
- **Position**: Front of ego car  
- **Adjusted Distance**: Longitudinal = 19.46 m, Lateral = 0.00 m  
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal = -4.11 m/s (approaching), Lateral = 0.00 m/s (stable)  
- **Relative Acceleration**: Longitudinal = 0.16 m/s², Lateral = 1.52 m/s²  
- **Motion**: Driving toward ego longitudinally, exact lateral alignment.  

**Risk Assessment**:  
1. **Proximity**:  
   - Longitudinal distance is large (19.46 m), lateral distance is 0.00 m (aligned but not colliding).  
2. **MDC (Minimum Distance to Collision)**:  
   - Since lateral distance is 0.00 m and stable, MDC is effectively the longitudinal distance (19.46 m).  
   - **MDC Risk**: 5 (No Risk, MDC > 5.0 m).  
3. **TTC (Time-to-Collision)**:  
   - TTC = Distance / |Relative Velocity| = 19.46 / 4.11 ≈ 4.73 seconds.  
   - **TTC Risk**: 4 (Low Risk, 3.0 < TTC ≤ 5.0 seconds).  

**Overall Risk**:  
- **Low Risk (4)** (No imminent collision, large distance and moderate TTC).

#### **Obstacle 30194**
- **Position**: Front of ego car  
- **Adjusted Distance**: Longitudinal = 11.15 m, Lateral = 0.00 m  
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal = -3.30 m/s (approaching), Lateral = 0.00 m/s (stable)  
- **Relative Acceleration**: Longitudinal = 0.11 m/s², Lateral = 0.97 m/s²  
- **Motion**: Driving toward ego longitudinally, exact lateral alignment.  

**Risk Assessment**:  
1. **Proximity**:  
   - Longitudinal distance is moderate (11.15 m), lateral distance is 0.00 m (aligned but not colliding).  
2. **MDC (Minimum Distance to Collision)**:  
   - Since lateral distance is 0.00 m and stable, MDC is effectively the longitudinal distance (11.15 m).  
   - **MDC Risk**: 5 (No Risk, MDC > 5.0 m).  
3. **TTC (Time-to-Collision)**:  
   - TTC = Distance / |Relative Velocity| = 11.15 / 3.30 ≈ 3.38 seconds.  
   - **TTC Risk**: 4 (Low Risk, 3.0 < TTC ≤ 5.0 seconds).  

**Overall Risk**:  
- **Low Risk (4)** (No imminent collision, moderate distance and TTC).

### **Trajectory Analysis (Across Timesteps)**  
- Both obstacles are longitudinally aligned with the ego vehicle (lateral distance = 0.00 m).  
- **Obstacle 30193**:  
  - Longitudinal distance decreases from 24.39 m to 19.46 m over 0.9 seconds (~5.5 m/s closing speed).  
  - Relative velocity decreases slightly (from -7.44 m/s to -4.11 m/s), indicating deceleration.  
- **Obstacle 30194**:  
  - Longitudinal distance decreases from 15.16 m to 11.15 m over 0.9 seconds (~4.5 m/s closing speed).  
  - Relative velocity decreases slightly (from -5.84 m/s to -3.30 m/s), indicating deceleration.  

Neither obstacle is on an immediate collision path (TTC > 3.0 s, MDC > 5.0 m).  

---

### **Final Determination**  
- **No Collision Scenario**:  
  - No obstacle has a risk score of 0 (collision) or 1 (extreme risk).  
  - Both obstacles are at **Low Risk (4)** due to stable lateral alignment and moderate longitudinal distances.
