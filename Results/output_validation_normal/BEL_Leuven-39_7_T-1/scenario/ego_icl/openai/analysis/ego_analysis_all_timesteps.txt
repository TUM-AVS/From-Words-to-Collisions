Let's analyze the collision risk for each obstacle based on the most recent timestep (at 0.9 seconds) and the obstacle trajectories from previous timesteps.

### Obstacle 30193 Analysis:

- **Current Position (0.9s):**
  - Longitudinal Distance: 19.46 m
  - Relative Velocity: -4.11 m/s (approaching)
  - Relative Acceleration: Moderate acceleration (0.16 m/s²)
  
- **Trajectory Analysis:**
  - At 0.0s, distance was 24.39 m; consistently decreasing as vehicle approaches.
  - Stable convergence indicated by decreasing relative speed.
  
- **Time-to-Collision (TTC):**  
  - TTC (Longitudinal) = Current Distance / |Relative Velocity| = 19.46 m / 4.11 m/s = approx. 4.74 seconds

- **Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC):**
  - Longitudinal: Convergence implies MCD is longitudinal distance, which is 19.46 m.
  - Lateral: Lateral alignment implies near-zero distance.

- **Risk Assessment:**
  - MDC longitudinally indicates no risk (5), but convergence and alignment require caution.
  - Current trajectory indicates a low risk (4).

### Obstacle 30194 Analysis:

- **Current Position (0.9s):**
  - Longitudinal Distance: 11.15 m
  - Relative Velocity: -3.30 m/s (approaching)
  - Relative Acceleration: Light acceleration (0.11 m/s²)
  
- **Trajectory Analysis:**
  - At 0.0s, distance was 15.16 m, shows consistent approach.
  - Convergence appears slower compared to Obstacle 30193.

- **Time-to-Collision (TTC):**
  - TTC (Longitudinal) = Current Distance / |Relative Velocity| = 11.15 m / 3.30 m/s = approx. 3.38 seconds

- **Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC):**
  - Longitudinal: Convergence suggests MCD is longitudinal distance, currently 11.15 m.
  - Lateral alignment is near-zero.

- **Risk Assessment:**
  - MDC and TTC indicate medium risk (3) due to the current trajectory continuing convergence.

### Conclusion:

- **Is this a Collision Scenario:**
  - Neither obstacle has a current distance indicating imminent collision (risk scores of 0 or 1).
  - Both obstacles present a converging trajectory indicating low risk of future collision with one being close to medium risk.

Given these evaluations, this scenario is NOT currently a collision scenario, as no obstacles meet the criteria for immediate collision or extreme risk.

### JSON Summary:

```json
{
    "CollisionObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "None",
        "OverallRiskScore": "NA"
    },
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "None",
        "OverallRiskScore": "NA"
    },
    "IsCollisionScenario": false,
    "Justification": "Neither obstacle has a TTC or MDC indicating immediate or extreme risk of collision."
}
```

This carefully assesses trajectory, distance, and motion understanding to safely classify the current state as not an immediate collision risk.
