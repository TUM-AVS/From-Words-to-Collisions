The ego vehicle and obstacle 30293.0 are in the same lanelet (456.0).  Analyzing the provided positions, both are moving in roughly the same direction (similar orientations). However, the obstacle is initially ahead of the ego vehicle.

Over the time steps, the distance between the ego vehicle and the obstacle decreases.  While the raw distance shrinks, it's important to consider their velocities and accelerations. Both are moving at similar speeds initially, around 7.3 m/s. The obstacle's acceleration fluctuates, while the ego vehicle generally accelerates.

By the final timestep (0.9s), the obstacle is at (406.6884, 29.338) and the ego vehicle is at (397.2027, 17.5255). Calculating the distance using the distance formula gives us roughly 10.4 units. While this seems close given they were initially further apart, their trajectories haven't intersected, and there's no immediate indication of a collision in the next few moments. However, given their closing distance and unpredictable accelerations, a higher risk score (2 or 3) seems warranted for monitoring.  The situation warrants closer monitoring, making a medium or high risk assessment reasonable. There isn't enough data to definitively say a collision is imminent (score 1) or has happened (score 0).
