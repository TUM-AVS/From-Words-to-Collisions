At t=0.9s, the ego vehicle is at (397.20, 17.53) with a velocity of 7.92 m/s heading in a direction of approximately -2.20 radians. The obstacle (ID: 30293.0) is at (406.69, 29.34) with a velocity of 7.09 m/s heading approximately -2.28 radians. Both are in the same lane (456.0).

**Analysis and Calculations:**

1. **Lateral Distance:**  The lateral distance between the ego and obstacle is approximately `sqrt((406.69 - 397.20)^2 + (29.34 - 17.53)^2)` which is about 14.24 meters.

2. **Longitudinal Distance:** Considering their orientations are nearly identical, the longitudinal distance can be approximated by the y-distance component which is approximately |17.53-29.34| ≈ 11.81 meters.

3. **TTC (Time to Collision):**  A simple TTC calculation using just current velocities and distances can be misleading due to the accelerations involved. The obstacle's acceleration drastically changed in the latest timestep. Looking at past data, both ego and obstacle velocities did not change significantly except in the most recent timestep, so we will use that.  We need to perform a more refined estimate looking at the change of velocity and acceleration for the obstacle over the timesteps: 

Let us examine the change in the obstacle’s longitudinal velocity over the most recent few timesteps.

At t=0.7s, obstacle velocity is 7.29 m/s.
At t=0.8s, obstacle velocity is 7.32 m/s.
At t=0.9s, obstacle velocity is 7.09 m/s.

From t=0.8s to t=0.9s the obstacle velocity dropped by 0.23m/s. From t=0.7s to t=0.8s the obstacle velocity increased by 0.03m/s.

At t=0.9 the obstacle has a large negative acceleration of -2.59 m/s^2. Given the sharp decrease in speed, it is assumed the obstacle is actively braking. There is insufficient data to reliably estimate the actual moment of collision (if any) so it is impossible to generate a reliable TTC.


4. **MDC (Minimum Distance between Centers):**  As calculated earlier, 14.24m

5. **Collision Prediction:** Based on the significant negative acceleration of the obstacle and the relatively large distances, a collision is unlikely in the next few time steps in both longitudinal and lateral direction. Therefore, the Overall Risk Score for the obstacle is 4, signifying Low Risk.
