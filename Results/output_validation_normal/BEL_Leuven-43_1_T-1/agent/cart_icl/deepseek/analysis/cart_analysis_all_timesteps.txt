### Analysis:

1. **Relative Motion and Trajectory**:
   - The ego vehicle and obstacle (ID: 30293) are both moving in the same lanelet (456.0) but are not on a direct collision course based on their trajectories.
   - The obstacle is ahead of the ego vehicle, and the lateral distance between them is significant (approximately 11.8m at 0.9s).

2. **Time to Collision (TTC)**:
   - The relative longitudinal distance between the ego and the obstacle is decreasing but remains large (approximately 9.49m at 0.9s).
   - The relative longitudinal velocity is approximately 7.0902 m/s (obstacle) - 7.9248 m/s (ego) = -0.8346 m/s (ego is closing the gap).
   - TTC = 9.49 / 0.8346 â‰ˆ 11.37s, which is a long time and indicates no immediate risk of collision.

3. **Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC)**:
   - The lateral distance is large, and the trajectories are not converging, so the MDC is also large.

4. **Risk Assessment**:
   - The obstacle is ahead of the ego vehicle, and the relative motion does not suggest an imminent collision.
   - The risk is **Low (4)** due to the significant distance and long TTC.
