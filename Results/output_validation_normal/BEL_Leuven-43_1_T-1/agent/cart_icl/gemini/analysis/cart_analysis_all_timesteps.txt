At t=0.9s, the ego vehicle at (397.20, 17.53) is moving in roughly the same direction as obstacle 30293 at (406.69, 29.34), as their orientations are -2.20 and -2.28 radians respectively.  The obstacle is ahead and to the left of the ego vehicle.

The obstacle's x-coordinate is decreasing more slowly than the ego's, indicating that the ego vehicle is closing the distance in the longitudinal direction.  The y-coordinate difference is also decreasing over time.  This suggests a potential collision risk.

To further assess the risk, we'll estimate TTC and MDC based on the last two provided timesteps (0.8s and 0.9s):

**Estimated TTC and MDC (Approximation)**

* **Relative Position (0.9s):**  (406.69 - 397.20, 29.34 - 17.53) = (9.49, 11.81)
* **Relative Velocity (Approximation):** ((406.69-407.15)/0.1 , (29.34 - 29.88)/0.1) = (-0.46, -0.54)  
* **Relative Velocity (Considering Ego):** ( (-0.46 - (-1.47)), -0.54 - (-1.62)) = (1.01, 1.08). This takes the ego vehicle's velocity change into account and is more accurate.

Using the relative positions and velocities calculated from the 0.8s and 0.9s data points to form an approximation gives us:

* **Approximate TTC (x-direction):** 9.49m / 1.01 m/s ≈ 9.40s
* **Approximate TTC (y-direction):** 11.81m / 1.08 m/s ≈ 10.94s

These TTC values suggest a low collision risk in the immediate future, as both are well over the typical threshold for concern (e.g., 2-3 seconds).  The obstacle and ego vehicle appear to be moving on nearly parallel paths, with the ego gradually closing the distance but not at an alarming rate.  The large lateral separation also reduces the risk.  While vigilance is still necessary, the current situation doesn't indicate an immediate danger. Because of the continuing closure rate, the risk score will be set at medium (3), rather than low (4).
