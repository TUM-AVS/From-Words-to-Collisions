### Obstacle Analysis: 30293

#### Trajectory Analysis:
- **Position**: Behind the ego car throughout all timesteps.
- **Longitudinal Distance**: The obstacle is consistently moving away from the ego car, as indicated by the increasing negative longitudinal distance (-10.39 m at 0.1s to -10.63 m at 0.9s).
- **Lateral Distance**: Exact alignment (0.00 m) throughout, meaning the obstacle is in the same lane as the ego car.
- **Relative Velocity**: 
  - Longitudinal: Negative values (-0.08 m/s to -0.86 m/s), indicating the obstacle is moving away from the ego car longitudinally.
  - Lateral: Small negative values (-0.34 m/s to -0.55 m/s), indicating slight movement away laterally.
- **Relative Acceleration**: 
  - Longitudinal: Mostly positive (0.06 m/s² to 1.80 m/s²), indicating increasing speed away from the ego car.
  - Lateral: Mostly positive (0.09 m/s² to 2.14 m/s²), indicating slight increasing speed away laterally.
- **Motion Description**: "Obstacle is moving away longitudinally. Exact lateral alignment or unknown case."

#### Risk Assessment:
1. **Proximity**:
   - Longitudinal: The obstacle is moving away, with distances ranging from 10.39 m to 10.63 m. This is well beyond the 5.0 m threshold for Low Risk.
   - Lateral: 0.00 m alignment, but the obstacle is moving away laterally (negative relative velocity).

2. **Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC)**:
   - Since the obstacle is moving away in both dimensions, the MDC is effectively the current distance, which is large (> 10 m). 
   - MDC > 5.0 m: **No Risk (5)**.

3. **Time-to-Collision (TTC)**:
   - Longitudinal: TTC = distance / relative_velocity = 10.63 m / 0.86 m/s ≈ 12.36 s (since relative velocity is negative, TTC is not applicable for collision).
   - Lateral: TTC = 0.00 m / 0.55 m/s = 0 s (but since the obstacle is moving away, TTC is not applicable for collision).
   - TTC > 5.0 s or not applicable: **No Risk (5)**.

4. **Overall Risk**:
   - The obstacle is moving away in both dimensions, with no indication of converging trajectories. 
   - **Overall Risk Score: 5 (Negligible Risk)**.

### JSON Summary:

{
    "CollisionObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "None",
        "OverallRiskScore": "None"
    },
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {

    }
}
```

### Explanation:
- There is no collision or extreme/high risk obstacle in this scenario. The only obstacle (30293) is moving away from the ego car in both longitudinal and lateral dimensions, with distances and velocities indicating negligible risk. The JSON summary reflects this with "None" for all critical risk categories.
