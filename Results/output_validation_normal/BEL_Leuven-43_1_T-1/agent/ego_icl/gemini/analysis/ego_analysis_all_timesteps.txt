Obstacle 30293 is behind the ego vehicle and moving away.  Across all timesteps, the longitudinal distance increases from -10.39m to -10.63m, indicating the obstacle is falling further behind the ego vehicle. The lateral distance remains at 0.00m throughout, meaning the obstacle stays directly behind the ego vehicle in the same lane. Since the relative longitudinal velocity is negative and increasing in magnitude, the obstacle is moving away from the ego vehicle longitudinally. Therefore, there is no risk of collision.

Given the longitudinal distance of -10.63m and a negative relative longitudinal velocity, TTC is not applicable (vehicles moving apart).  MDC is -10.63m.

Based on the MDC and the diverging trajectories, the risk level is 5 (Negligible Risk).
