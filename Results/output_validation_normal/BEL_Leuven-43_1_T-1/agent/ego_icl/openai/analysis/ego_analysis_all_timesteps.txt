**Obstacle 30293 Analysis**

1. **Trajectory Analysis Across Timesteps:**

   - **Initial Observations (t = 0.1s to 0.9s):**
     - The obstacle is consistently positioned behind the ego vehicle with the longitudinal distance ranging from -10.39 m to -10.63 m across the observed time interval.
     - The obstacle is moving away longitudinally as indicated by increasing negative longitudinal distances.
     - Lateral distance remains stable at 0.00 m indicating exact lateral alignment.

2. **Relative Velocity and Acceleration**:

   - The longitudinal relative velocity consistently indicates the obstacle moving away (negative values).
   - The obstacle's lateral velocity and acceleration suggest minor movement to the lateral direction but no significant closure to the ego vehicle. 
   - The longitudinal acceleration components mostly confirm the obstacle's trajectory diverging from the ego vehicle.

3. **Most Recent Timestep (t = 0.9s):**

   - **Adjusted Longitudinal Distance**: Assume it matches the raw distance of -10.63 m (typically adjusted values account for vehicle dimensions, but exact figures not provided here).
   - **Adjusted Lateral Distance**: Matches raw distance, 0.00 m.

4. **TTC and MDC Calculations**:

   - **Longitudinal TTC**:
     - Absolute relative velocity (|Relative velocity|) = 0.86 m/s (away from ego).
     - Since the obstacle is moving away, the TTC calculation is not applicable for collision.
   
   - **Lateral TTC**:
     - Even though the lateral velocity has some non-zero components, the consistent lateral alignment and absence of closure imply negligible risk.
  
   - **Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC)**:
     - Although longitudinally and laterally aligned (0.00 m laterally), the increasing longitudinal distance ensures that the projected paths will not lead to collision. 
     - The MDC based on longitudinal projection is > 5.0 m as the path is diverging.

5. **Risk Assessment**:

   - Given the consistent motion away from the ego vehicle and increasing separation, the obstacle poses minimal risk.
   - Both TTC and MDC calculations confirm divergence, leading to a negligible risk assessment.

**Conclusion**:

- **Overall Risk Assessment**:
  - Longitudinal divergence with stable lateral position places the obstacle under "Negligible Risk" category despite alignment.

This assessment reflects the negligible collision risk posed by the obstacle due to its stable trajectory moving away from the ego vehicle.
