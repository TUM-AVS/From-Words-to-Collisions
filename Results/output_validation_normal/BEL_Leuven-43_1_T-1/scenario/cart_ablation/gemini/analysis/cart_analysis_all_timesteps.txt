At t=0.9s, the ego vehicle is at (397.20, 17.53) and the obstacle is at (406.69, 29.34). Both are in the same lanelet (456). While the obstacle is somewhat ahead of the ego vehicle in terms of longitudinal position, the lateral distance is significant, around 11.8 meters based on a rough right triangle approximation.  Additionally, both vehicles appear to be traveling in roughly the same direction based on their orientations, though the obstacle seems to be braking hard (-2.59 m/sÂ² acceleration).  Given the lateral separation and similar headings, a collision within the next second appears unlikely unless the obstacle performs a sudden, sharp maneuver towards the ego vehicle's path.  The obstacle's rapid deceleration does raise some concern, suggesting it might be reacting to an unforeseen event, but there's not enough information to determine if that poses an immediate collision risk to the ego vehicle. Therefore, the current risk level is low (4 or 5).
