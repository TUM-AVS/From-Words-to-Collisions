At t=0.9s, the ego vehicle is at (397.20, 17.53) and the obstacle is at (406.69, 29.34). Both are in the same lanelet (456). While the obstacle is somewhat ahead and to the left of the ego vehicle, the lateral separation is not substantial.  More importantly, the obstacle's velocity has sharply decreased (7.09 from 7.32 in the previous timestep) with a large negative acceleration (-2.59). This sudden deceleration indicates a potential emergency braking maneuver by the obstacle, increasing the risk of a rear-end collision if the ego vehicle does not react quickly. Although not an imminent collision at this instant, the rapid change in the obstacle's kinematics warrants classifying it as an extreme risk.
