### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep (0.9 seconds):

### Obstacle Analysis:
- **Obstacle ID**: 30293.0  
  - **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is in the same lanelet (456.0) as the ego vehicle. Over the past timesteps, the distance between the ego and the obstacle has been decreasing, but the obstacle is still relatively far (approx. 9.5m in X and 11.8m in Y at t=0.9s). The obstacle is ahead of the ego but not directly in its immediate path.  
  - **Distance safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk)  
  - **Time Risk reason**: The relative velocity is low (ego: 7.9248 m/s, obstacle: 7.0902 m/s). The obstacle is decelerating (-2.5952 m/sÂ²), which increases the time to collision. TTC is high (>5s).  
  - **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)  
  - **Overall Risk score**: 3 (Medium Risk)  

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. **Same Lanelet**: Both ego and obstacle are in lanelet 456.0, indicating shared space.  
2. **Trajectory**: The obstacle is ahead of the ego and moving in the same general direction. The distance is decreasing but not at a critical rate.  
3. **Velocity/Acceleration**: The obstacle is decelerating, which reduces collision risk. The ego is accelerating slightly, but the relative speed difference is small.  
4. **Collision Risk**: No immediate collision risk due to sufficient distance and time to react.
