### Obstacle Analysis for Most Recent Timestep (0.9 seconds)

**Obstacle 30293.0:**
- **Distance Risk reason:**  
  The obstacle is in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle and is around 10.8 meters away. There has been a consistent decrease in separation distance over the last timesteps.
- **Distance safety score:** 2 (High Risk)
  
- **Time Risk reason:**  
  Relative speeds and proximity are concerning, given the deceleration. The obstacle's trajectory shows it is converging towards the ego's path and has recently reduced its speed significantly.
- **Time safety score:** 2 (High Risk)

- **Overall Risk score:** 2

**Obstacle 30294.0:**
- **Distance Risk reason:**  
  The obstacle is located in a different lanelet from the ego vehicle, with a large and consistent separation distance.
- **Distance safety score:** 4 (Low Risk)

- **Time Risk reason:**  
  The obstacle's trajectory indicates it is maintaining its position relative to the ego vehicle, with no significant changes in velocity or approach vectors.
- **Time safety score:** 4 (Low Risk)

- **Overall Risk score:** 4

**Obstacle 30295.0:**
- **Distance Risk reason:**
  The obstacle is located in a different lanelet from the ego vehicle, indicating no direct conflict.
- **Distance safety score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)

- **Time Risk reason:**
  Stable velocity and trajectory along a parallel path with no convergence towards the ego vehicle.
- **Time safety score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)

- **Overall Risk score:** 5

**Obstacle 30296.0:**
- **Distance Risk reason:**
  Located quite far in a different lanelet from the ego vehicle, ensuring no immediate risk.
- **Distance safety score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)

- **Time Risk reason:**
  Consistent speed and displacement trajectory further support the reduced risk position.
- **Time safety score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)

- **Overall Risk score:** 5

**Obstacle 30297.0:**
- **Distance Risk reason:**
  Positioned in another lanelet with a significant lateral distance, presents no immediate threat.
- **Distance safety score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)

- **Time Risk reason:** 
  The trajectory over time reflects no initiating move towards the ego vehicle path which minimizes risk.
- **Time safety score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)

- **Overall Risk score:** 5

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
- Obstacle 30293.0, being in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle and closer than is comfortable, presents a high collision risk. Other obstacles do not pose an immediate collision risk due to significant lateral separation or consistent trajectories that avoid convergence with the ego vehicle. Thus, there is no direct collision scenario, although 30293.0 requires urgent monitoring and potential action to reduce the risk of a collision.
