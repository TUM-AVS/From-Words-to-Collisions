Obstacle 30293 is behind the ego vehicle and moving away longitudinally. The lateral distance is zero, suggesting the obstacle is directly behind the ego vehicle or the lateral movement is unknown.  While the relative lateral velocity is non-zero, the longitudinal movement away from the ego vehicle significantly reduces the risk of collision. The overall situation presents negligible risk.
