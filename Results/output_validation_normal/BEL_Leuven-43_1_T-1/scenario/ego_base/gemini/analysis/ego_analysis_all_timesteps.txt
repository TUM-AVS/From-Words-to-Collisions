At t=0.9s, obstacle 30293 is behind the ego vehicle and moving away longitudinally at an increasing speed (-0.86 m/s).  While the lateral distance is zero, suggesting it is directly behind, the lateral velocity is also non-zero (-0.55 m/s) and increasing. This may imply it is beginning a lane change maneuver but currently poses no immediate threat. The longitudinal acceleration is also positive and rather high (1.80 m/sÂ²), increasing the rate at which it is moving away. The overall assessment is that this obstacle presents a negligible risk at this timestep.
