### Safety analysis for timestep 0.9s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 30293
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 30293 is behind the ego vehicle at a longitudinal distance of -10.63m and a lateral distance of -10.63m.  The negative longitudinal distance indicates it's behind the ego vehicle, posing no immediate risk. The lateral distance suggests it is not directly behind but slightly offset.  Given its position and the fact it's moving away, the distance poses negligible risk.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: The obstacle is moving away from the ego vehicle longitudinally. This implies an increasing time to collision, further reducing risk. Lateral movement also does not indicate a collision course.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5
