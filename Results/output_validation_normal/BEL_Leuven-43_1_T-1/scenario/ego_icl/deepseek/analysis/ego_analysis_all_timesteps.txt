### Obstacle-by-Obstacle Analysis (Most Recent Timestep: 0.9s)

**Obstacle 30293:**
- **Position:** Behind ego car (longitudinal -10.63m, lateral 0.00m)
- **Relative Velocity:** longitudinal -0.86 m/s, lateral -0.55 m/s
- **Relative Acceleration:** longitudinal 1.80 m/s², lateral 2.14 m/s²
- **Motion Description:** Obstacle is moving away longitudinally. Exact lateral alignment or unknown case.

#### Trajectory Analysis:
- The obstacle is consistently moving away from the ego vehicle longitudinally (distance increases from -10.39m to -10.63m over 0.9s).
- Lateral distance remains 0.00m (exact alignment), but the lateral velocity (-0.55 m/s) suggests the obstacle is moving away laterally as well.
- Acceleration components are positive, indicating the obstacle is accelerating away in both dimensions.

#### TTC Calculation:
- **Longitudinal TTC:** Not applicable (distance increasing, relative velocity negative).
- **Lateral TTC:** Not applicable (distance stable at 0.00m but velocity indicates moving away).

#### MDC Calculation:
- **Longitudinal MDC:** 10.63m (distance increasing, no convergence).
- **Lateral MDC:** 0.00m (exact alignment, but moving away).

#### Risk Assessment:
- **Longitudinal Risk:** No Risk (5) - Distance increasing, no convergence.
- **Lateral Risk:** No Risk (5) - Exact alignment but moving away, no convergence.
- **Overall Risk Score:** 5 (No Risk).

### Conclusion:
- No collision or extreme risk is detected for Obstacle 30293.
- The obstacle is moving away in both longitudinal and lateral dimensions, with no indication of convergence.
