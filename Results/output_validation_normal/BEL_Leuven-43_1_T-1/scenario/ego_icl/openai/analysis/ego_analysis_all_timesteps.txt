### Obstacle-by-Obstacle Analysis

**Obstacle 30293 Analysis:**

**Trajectory Analysis:**
- Over the given timesteps, the obstacle has been consistently behind the ego vehicle with exact lateral alignment (lateral distance = 0.00m).
- The obstacle is moving away longitudinally as indicated by the negative relative velocity values.

**Timestep 0.9 seconds Analysis:**
- **Adjusted Distances:** 
  - Longitudinal: -10.63 meters (behind ego vehicle)
  - Lateral: Exact alignment (0.00 meters)

- **Relative Velocities:**
  - Longitudinal: -0.86 m/s (moving away)
  - Lateral: -0.55 m/s (moving away)

**TTC and MDC Calculations:**
- **Time-to-Collision (TTC):**
  - Longitudinal: Not applicable for collision as relative velocity indicates moving away (negative value).
  - Lateral: Not applicable (since negative, suggesting separation created).

- **Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC):**
  - As the obstacle is aligned laterally (0.00 meters) and moving away in both dimensions, MDC does not pose an immediate risk.

**Risk Assessment:**
- With the obstacle moving away, there is no immediate risk. Both the relative motion and adjusted distances confirm a diverging path, which means:
  - Risk due to lateral alignment assessed as No Risk (5) given the obstacle's motion and increasing separation.

### Conclusion
- The overall risk assessment for Obstacle 30293 is No Risk (5) as both the longitudinal and lateral components indicate an increasing distance with no converging trajectory.
- There is no collision scenario or extreme risk with this obstacle as it is moving away and increasing the separation from the ego vehicle.

### Final JSON Summary:
```json
{
  "CollisionObstacle": null,
  "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null,
  "IsCollisionScenario": false,
  "Justification": "Obstacle 30293 is moving away from the ego vehicle, increasing distance longitudinally and maintaining separation laterally, resulting in no collision risk."
}
```

Overall, the analysis confirms there is no collision scenario present with the examined obstacle under current trajectory and velocity conditions.
