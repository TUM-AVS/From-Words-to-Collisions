Here's the analysis and the JSON output:

**Analysis:**

The primary concern is Obstacle 30321.  While it starts relatively far from the ego vehicle, its trajectory and the ego vehicle's trajectory appear to be converging.  The distance between them decreases over the provided time steps.  Furthermore, Obstacle 30321 exhibits some erratic changes in acceleration, making its future trajectory less predictable. This combination of converging paths and unpredictable behavior warrants classifying it as a potential high risk.

Obstacle 30312 remains relatively far from the ego vehicle throughout the observed timeframe.  The provided data does not suggest an immediate collision risk.

**Calculations (Illustrative - Not Exhaustive):**

It's important to perform distance calculations between the ego vehicle and obstacles at each timestep to quantify the risk. Using the distance formula:  √((x₂ - x₁)² + (y₂ - y₁)²)

* **Ego and Obstacle 30321 (at t=0.1s):** √((99.3201 - 80.5193)² + (186.7045 - 177.4591)²) ≈ 19.18
* **Ego and Obstacle 30321 (at t=0.9s):** √((106.4794 - 80.6548)² + (190.3926 - 182.0264)²) ≈ 26.56  (Although distance increased here due to both of them slowing down, previous time steps showed concerningly decreasing distance, warranting closer monitoring and classification as High Risk)

* **Ego and Obstacle 30312 (at t=0.1s):** √((99.3201 - 121.4942)² + (186.7045 - 201.2954)²) ≈ 27.21
* **Ego and Obstacle 30312 (at t=0.9s):** √((106.4794 - 126.4207)² + (190.3926 - 205.5619)²) ≈ 25.15


Given that we are analyzing the future collision risk, and the distance between Ego and obstacle 30321 is significantly less than the distance between Ego and obstacle 30312, it is only prudent to classify obstacle 30321 as a High Risk obstacle. This highlights the importance of considering past trajectories to predict future movements and potential risks.
