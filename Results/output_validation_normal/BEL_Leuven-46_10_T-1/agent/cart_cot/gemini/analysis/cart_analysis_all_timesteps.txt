Here's a collision risk analysis of the provided scenario focusing on the last timestep (0.9 seconds) and utilizing previous data for trajectory prediction:

**Scenario at 0.9 seconds:**

* **Ego (30319.0):** Position (106.4794, 190.3926), Orientation 0.4886, Velocity 8.4141, Acceleration -0.8639, Lanelet 951.0
* **Obstacle 30312.0:** Position (126.4207, 205.5619), Orientation 0.7157, Velocity 8.1624, Acceleration 0.4873, Lanelet 219.0
* **Obstacle 30321.0:** Position (80.6548, 182.0264), Orientation 1.8304, Velocity 6.3117, Acceleration 0.2285, Lanelet 921.0

**Analysis and Predictions:**

1. **Ego vs. Obstacle 30312.0:**
    * **Distance:** Approximately 25.54 units (using the distance formula on Cartesian coordinates).
    * **TTC:**  Based on current velocities and assuming constant acceleration, a rough estimate of TTC can be calculated. However, given the changing accelerations, a precise TTC is challenging without more sophisticated prediction models.  The significant distance and difference in Y coordinates currently suggests no immediate collision risk.
    * **Risk Assessment:**  The lateral separation between the ego vehicle and obstacle 30312.0 is relatively large and their lanelets are different, which lessen the risk, thus a score of 4 (Low Risk) is assigned to the obstacle due to sufficient space and time for maneuvering, though continued monitoring is necessary due to the changing dynamics.

2. **Ego vs. Obstacle 30321.0:**
    * **Distance:** Approximately 26.09 units.
    * **TTC:** Similar to the previous case, precise TTC calculation is difficult.  There is a comfortable distance at this point but the ego vehicle and obstacle 30321.0 are within the same Y-coordinate range, warranting additional attention.
    * **Risk Assessment:**  Although a fair distance separates them currently, their orientations, velocities, and proximity warrant further investigation. The slightly converging paths may result in higher future risk. Therefore a score of 3 (Medium Risk) is assigned, suggesting manageable risk with appropriate action. Further trajectory analysis is recommended to confirm.
