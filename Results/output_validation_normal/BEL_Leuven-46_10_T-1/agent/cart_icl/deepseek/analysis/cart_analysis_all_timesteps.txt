### Analysis:

1. **Obstacle 30312 (ID: 30312)**:
   - **Position**: (126.4207, 205.5619) at 0.9s
   - **Relative Position to Ego**: Ego is at (106.4794, 190.3926), so obstacle is ahead and to the right.
   - **Distance to Ego**: ~20.94m (longitudinal), ~15.17m (lateral).
   - **Relative Velocity**: Ego velocity = 8.4141 m/s, obstacle velocity = 8.1624 m/s. Relative velocity = 0.2517 m/s (closing slowly).
   - **TTC**: ~20.94 / 0.2517 â‰ˆ 83.2s (very high, negligible risk).
   - **Risk**: **Negligible (5)**.

2. **Obstacle 30321 (ID: 30321)**:
   - **Position**: (80.6548, 182.0264) at 0.9s
   - **Relative Position to Ego**: Ego is at (106.4794, 190.3926), so obstacle is behind and to the left.
   - **Distance to Ego**: ~25.82m (longitudinal), ~8.37m (lateral).
   - **Relative Velocity**: Ego velocity = 8.4141 m/s, obstacle velocity = 6.3117 m/s. Relative velocity = 2.1024 m/s (obstacle is lagging).
   - **TTC**: Not applicable (obstacle is behind and moving slower).
   - **Risk**: **Negligible (5)**.

### Summary:
- No collision or extreme/high-risk obstacles detected in the scenario.
- Both obstacles are at a safe distance with negligible risk.
