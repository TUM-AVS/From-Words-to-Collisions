At t=0.9s, the ego vehicle (ID 30319) is at (106.4794, 190.3926) with a velocity of 8.4141 m/s. Let's analyze the two obstacles:

**Obstacle 30312:** Located at (126.4207, 205.5619) with a velocity of 8.1624 m/s.  This obstacle is significantly further ahead in the x-direction and also offset in the y-direction.  The lanelets also differ (951 for ego, 219 for obstacle), suggesting they are not on a collision course.  While more information about the lanelet geometry would be helpful, the current data suggests a low risk.

**Obstacle 30321:** Located at (80.6548, 182.0264) with a velocity of 6.3117 m/s. This obstacle is behind the ego vehicle in the x-direction and slightly offset in the y-direction. The different lanelets (951 for ego and 921 for the obstacle) again suggest they are not on a direct collision course. Based on the provided data, there is no immediate risk of collision.

**TTC and MDC Approximation:**

A precise TTC/MDC calculation is challenging without lanelet geometry and vehicle dimensions. However, a rough approximation can be made using straight-line projections. For obstacle 30312, the large x-difference and different lanelets suggest a high TTC.  For obstacle 30321, though behind the ego vehicle, the different lanelets and the lateral offset suggest a reasonably high TTC as well.

**Overall Risk Assessment at t=0.9s:**

* **Obstacle 30312:** Low Risk (4) due to the separation distance, different lanelets, and no indication of converging trajectories.
* **Obstacle 30321:** Low Risk (4) due to the separation distance, different lanelets, and no indication of converging trajectories.
