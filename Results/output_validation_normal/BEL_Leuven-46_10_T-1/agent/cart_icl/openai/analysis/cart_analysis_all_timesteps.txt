Upon evaluating the scenario based on the most recent timestep (0.9 seconds), let's examine each obstacle in relation to the ego vehicle's trajectory and motion.

### Ego Vehicle (Ego: 30319.0)
- Position at 0.9s: (106.4794, 190.3926)
- Velocity: 8.4141 m/s
- Acceleration: -0.8639 m/s^2
- Lanelet: 951.0

### Obstacle Analysis

1. **Obstacle: 30312.0**
   - Position at 0.9s: (126.4207, 205.5619)
   - Orientation: 0.7157 radians
   - Velocity: 8.1624 m/s
   - Lanelet: 219.0
   - **Analysis**: This obstacle is located in a different lanelet (219.0) and is not directly in the path of the ego vehicle. The lateral distance remains significantly large, providing sufficient spatial separation. There is negligible risk of collision here.

2. **Obstacle: 30321.0**
   - Position at 0.9s: (80.6548, 182.0264)
   - Orientation: 1.8304 radians
   - Velocity: 6.3117 m/s
   - Lanelet: 921.0
   - Relative Position: Behind and laterally separated from the ego vehicle.
   - **Analysis**: This obstacle trails behind the ego vehicle with considerable lateral separation, thus not posing any immediate collision threat. There is no significant risk of collision.

### Summary of Risk Levels
- Neither of the obstacles are in the same lanelet or have a trajectory that indicates potential intersection with the ego vehicle, implying **negligible risk** for both obstacles.

Based on the assessment and brief analysis, both obstacles at 0.9 seconds maintain a safe distance and do not exhibit any high-risk collision parameters, like converging trajectories or insufficient time gaps for safe reaction.
