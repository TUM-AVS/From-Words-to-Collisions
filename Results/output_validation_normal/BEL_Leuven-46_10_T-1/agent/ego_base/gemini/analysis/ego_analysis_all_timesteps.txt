At t=0.9s, Obstacle 30312 is in the front-left, 20.22m longitudinally and 2.42m laterally away from the ego vehicle.  It is moving towards the ego vehicle longitudinally at -0.46 m/s and moving away laterally at 1.84 m/s. This poses a low risk as the longitudinal velocity is very low and it is moving laterally away from the ego car.

Obstacle 30321 is in the rear-left, 22.22m longitudinally and 3.12m laterally away. The obstacle is moving further away both longitudinally and laterally. The longitudinal velocity is -6.98 m/s, and the lateral velocity is 6.15 m/s, which indicates that it poses a low risk.
