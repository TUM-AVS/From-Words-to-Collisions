### Obstacle-by-Obstacle Analysis

#### Obstacle 30312 (Front-left of ego car)
- **Most Recent Timestep (0.9s):**
  - Adjusted longitudinal distance: 20.22 m (closing at -0.46 m/s)
  - Adjusted lateral distance: 2.42 m (moving away at 1.84 m/s)
  - Motion: Approaching longitudinally but moving away laterally to the left.
  
- **Trajectory Analysis:**
  - Longitudinal distance decreases from 21.85 m to 20.22 m over 0.9s (closing speed decreasing).
  - Lateral distance increases from 1.49 m to 2.42 m (consistent lateral separation).
  
- **TTC Calculation:**
  - Longitudinal TTC = 20.22 / 0.46 â‰ˆ 43.96s (negligible risk).
  - Lateral TTC: Not applicable (moving apart).
  
- **MDC Calculation:**
  - Minimum distance is lateral (2.42 m), which is increasing. No risk of collision.
  
- **Risk Assessment:**
  - Longitudinal: Low closing speed, large distance (Risk 5).
  - Lateral: Increasing distance (Risk 5).
  - **Overall Risk: 5 (Negligible Risk).**

#### Obstacle 30321 (Rear-left of ego car)
- **Most Recent Timestep (0.9s):**
  - Adjusted longitudinal distance: -22.22 m (moving away at -6.98 m/s).
  - Adjusted lateral distance: 3.12 m (moving away at 6.15 m/s).
  - Motion: Moving away both longitudinally and laterally to the left.
  
- **Trajectory Analysis:**
  - Longitudinal distance increases (more negative) from -16.44 m to -22.22 m (rapidly moving away).
  - Lateral distance increases from 0.00 m to 3.12 m (consistent lateral separation).
  
- **TTC Calculation:**
  - Longitudinal TTC: Not applicable (moving apart).
  - Lateral TTC: Not applicable (moving apart).
  
- **MDC Calculation:**
  - Minimum distance is lateral (3.12 m), which is increasing. No risk of collision.
  
- **Risk Assessment:**
  - Longitudinal: Moving away (Risk 5).
  - Lateral: Moving away (Risk 5).
  - **Overall Risk: 5 (Negligible Risk).**

### Conclusion:
- Neither obstacle poses any significant collision risk. Both are moving away from the ego vehicle in both longitudinal and lateral dimensions.
- No collision or extreme/high-risk obstacles detected.
