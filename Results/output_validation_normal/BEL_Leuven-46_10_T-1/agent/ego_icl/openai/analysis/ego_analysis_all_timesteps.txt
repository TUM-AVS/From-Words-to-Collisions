### Analysis of Obstacle 30312:

**Trajectory and Position Analysis:**
- Over multiple timesteps, Obstacle 30312 is located to the Front-left of the ego vehicle.
- The longitudinal distance has gradually decreased from 21.85m at 0.1 seconds to 20.22m at 0.9 seconds, indicating a closing distance longitudinally.
- The lateral distance has increased from 1.49m at 0.1 seconds to 2.42m at 0.9 seconds, suggesting the obstacle is moving further away laterally to the left.

**Motion Description:**
- The obstacle is consistently reported as moving toward the ego vehicle longitudinally while moving away laterally to the left.

**TTC and MDC Calculations:**
- **Longitudinal TTC** = 20.22 m / 0.46 m/s = 43.96 seconds (given that the relative longitudinal velocity is negative, which means the obstacle is actually decreasing this closing rate)
- **Lateral TTC** is not applicable as the obstacle is moving away.
- **MDC**: Since the longitudinal distance is decreasing but still at 20.22m and with a lateral distance that is growing, the immediate risk is low.

**Risk Assessment:**
- Given the high TTC and increasing lateral distance, the risk from Obstacle 30312 is negligible. The ego vehicle has sufficient time to change its path if required.

**Assigned Risk Score**: Negligible Risk (5)

### Analysis of Obstacle 30321:

**Trajectory and Position Analysis:**
- Initially behind the ego vehicle as indicated by negative longitudinal distances, Obstacle 30321's position changes to the rear-left.
- The longitudinal gap increased over time from -16.44m to -22.22m by the 0.9-second mark.
- Lateral distance increased from an aligned position (0.00m) to 3.12m, indicating movement away to the left.

**Motion Description:**
- The obstacle has consistently been moving away longitudinally and laterally over time, providing an overall diverging trajectory.

**TTC and MDC Calculations:**
- **Longitudinal TTC** is not applicable here, as the distances are increasing.
- **Lateral TTC** is also not a concern as the lateral distance is increasing.
- **MDC**: Obstacle 30321 poses negligible risk due to the increasing distances and diverging velocities.

**Risk Assessment:**
- Given the increasing distance and the diverging motion, the calculated collision risk is negligible.

**Assigned Risk Score**: Negligible Risk (5)
