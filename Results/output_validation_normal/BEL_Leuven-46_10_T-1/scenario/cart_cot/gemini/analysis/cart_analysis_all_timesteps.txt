### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 30312.0
- Distance Risk reason: This obstacle is located at (126.4207, 205.5619) at t=0.9s, while the ego vehicle is at (106.4794, 190.3926).  The distance between them is substantial, and the historical trajectory shows the obstacle consistently remaining far from the ego vehicle. Lanelets also differ (219 vs 951).
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: The obstacle's velocity and acceleration, observed over the timesteps, don't indicate any immediate threat to the ego vehicle given their current trajectories and separation.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 30321.0
- Distance Risk reason: This obstacle is located at (80.6548, 182.0264) at t=0.9s, while the ego vehicle is at (106.4794, 190.3926). Though closer than 30312.0, it is still a safe distance, and past positions suggest diverging trajectories. Different lanelets (921 vs 951) also reduces risk.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: The obstacle's velocity and acceleration do not indicate any concerning approach towards the ego vehicle.  The historical data confirms this.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4


### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. **Most critical obstacles:** Obstacle 30321.0 is the closest, but poses no imminent threat. Obstacle 30312.0 is farther away and moves away from the ego vehicle's trajectory.
2. **Trajectory analysis:** Over the 10 timesteps, both obstacles maintain distinct trajectories from the ego vehicle. 30312.0 consistently stays far, with an increasing lateral distance. 30321.0 is also on a different trajectory than the ego vehicle, not converging significantly.
3. **Relative position, velocity, and acceleration:** The relative positions, velocities, and accelerations between the ego and the obstacles do not suggest a collision. The ego's lane change at 0.8s also further separates it from obstacle 30321.0.  The relative velocities and accelerations don't indicate any closing behavior that would lead to a collision.
4. **Collision determination:** No collision has occurred, and none is imminent based on the given data.
5. **Reasoning:** The trajectories, distances, relative velocities, and accelerations all support the conclusion that this is not a collision scenario.
