### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep:

### Obstacle Analysis:
#### Obstacle ID: 30312.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is moving away from the ego vehicle, with increasing longitudinal and lateral distances over time. The current Euclidean distance is ~20.5m.
- **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- **Time Risk reason**: The relative velocity is positive (ego decelerating faster than obstacle), and the TTC is increasing. No convergence in trajectories observed.
- **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- **Overall Risk score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)

#### Obstacle ID: 30321.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is moving away laterally but shows some longitudinal convergence. Current Euclidean distance is ~25.8m, increasing over time.
- **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
- **Time Risk reason**: The obstacle's velocity is lower than ego's, and its trajectory is diverging. TTC is large and increasing.
- **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
- **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low Risk)

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. Examined all obstacles at t=0.9s and their trajectories from t=0.1s to t=0.9s
2. Obstacle 30312 is moving away with increasing distance and positive relative velocity
3. Obstacle 30321 shows lateral divergence but minor longitudinal convergence, though distance remains safe
4. No obstacles show collision course or extreme risk patterns
5. Ego's deceleration is maintaining safe distances
