### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
This scenario is not a collision scenario. All obstacles maintain safe distances, follow differentiated paths, and exhibit no risk of converging with the ego vehicle based on historical trajectories and the latest timestep data. Each obstacle remains in its lanelet across different spatial trajectories, with velocity patterns that maintain or increase separation.
