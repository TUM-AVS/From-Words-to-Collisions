Obstacle 30312 is moving towards the ego vehicle longitudinally, but it is also moving away laterally.  At the most recent timestep (0.9 seconds), the longitudinal distance is 20.22 meters and the lateral distance is 2.42 meters, and increasing. The relative longitudinal velocity is -0.46 m/s indicating a slow closing speed, but the lateral motion suggests divergence.  Given the current trend, a collision with Obstacle 30312 is unlikely in the immediate future.

Obstacle 30321 is moving away from the ego vehicle both longitudinally and laterally. At the latest timestep, it is approximately 22.22m behind and 3.12m to the left of the ego, and these distances are increasing. Thus, it poses no immediate risk.
