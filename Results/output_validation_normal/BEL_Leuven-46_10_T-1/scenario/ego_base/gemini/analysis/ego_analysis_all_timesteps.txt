At t=0.9s, Obstacle 30312 is in the front-left, moving away laterally and slowly approaching longitudinally (-0.46 m/s).  It poses a low risk currently, but its longitudinal velocity is decreasing, suggesting a potential for future risk if the trend continues. Obstacle 30321 is in the rear-left and moving further away both longitudinally and laterally. It presents negligible risk.

**Risk Levels and Definitions:**
<Collision (Score: 0)>: Actual collision has occurred or is unavoidable within the next timestep.
<Extreme Risk (Score: 1)>: Immediate collision or very high likelihood of impact. Urgent action is required.
<High Risk (Score: 2)>: Close to collision or highly probable collision path. Needs prompt attention and quick manoeuvring.
<Medium Risk (Score: 3)>: Moderate collision risk but manageable with timely reactions and proper strategies.
<Low Risk (Score: 4)>: Minimal collision risk. The situation is controllable with sufficient time to react.
<Negligible Risk (Score: 5)>: No significant collision risk. Obstacles are either moving away or far enough not to interfere.
