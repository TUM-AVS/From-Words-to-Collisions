### Safety analysis for timestep 0.9 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID:** 30312
- **Distance Risk reason:** Obstacle 30312 is located 20.22m longitudinally and 20.22m laterally in the front-left of the ego vehicle.  While the longitudinal velocity suggests it's getting slightly closer (-0.46 m/s), the lateral velocity indicates it's moving away (1.84 m/s), and the distances are significant.
- **Distance safety score:** 5
- **Time Risk reason:**  Even though the longitudinal velocity is negative, it is very small, and the distance is substantial, giving ample time to react.  The lateral movement further reduces any risk.  Precise TTC calculations aren't provided, but based on the given data, the TTC is high.
- **Time safety score:** 5
- **Overall Risk score:** 5

- **Obstacle ID:** 30321
- **Distance Risk reason:** Obstacle 30321 is located 22.22m behind and to the left of the ego vehicle, and moving further away both longitudinally (-6.98 m/s) and laterally (6.15 m/s).
- **Distance safety score:** 5
- **Time Risk reason:** The obstacle is moving away from the ego vehicle in both directions. The TTC is very high, meaning a collision is highly unlikely.
- **Time safety score:** 5
- **Overall Risk score:** 5
