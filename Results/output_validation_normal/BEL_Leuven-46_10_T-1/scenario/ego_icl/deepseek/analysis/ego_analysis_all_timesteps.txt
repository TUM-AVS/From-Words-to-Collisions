### Obstacle-by-Obstacle Analysis (Most Recent Timestep: 0.9 seconds)

#### Obstacle 30312 (Front-left of ego car)
- **Adjusted Distances**: Longitudinal 20.22 m, Lateral 2.42 m  
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal -0.46 m/s (approaching), Lateral 1.84 m/s (moving away)  
- **Motion Description**: Obstacle is driving toward the ego car longitudinally. Obstacle is moving away laterally to the left.  
- **Trajectory Analysis**:  
  - Longitudinal distance is decreasing (from 21.85 m at 0.1s to 20.22 m at 0.9s).  
  - Lateral distance is increasing (from 1.49 m at 0.1s to 2.42 m at 0.9s).  
  - The obstacle is moving diagonally away from the ego car (left and forward).  

- **Time-to-Collision (TTC)**:  
  - Longitudinal TTC = 20.22 / 0.46 ≈ 43.96 seconds (No Risk, TTC > 5.0s)  
  - Lateral TTC = Not applicable (moving away).  

- **Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC)**:  
  - The obstacle is moving away both longitudinally and laterally. The MDC is the current lateral distance (2.42 m), which is Low Risk (3.0 < MDC ≤ 5.0).  

- **Overall Risk**:  
  - No Risk (5) since both TTC and MDC indicate no immediate danger.

#### Obstacle 30321 (Rear-left of ego car)
- **Adjusted Distances**: Longitudinal -22.22 m (behind), Lateral 3.12 m  
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal -6.98 m/s (moving away), Lateral 6.15 m/s (moving away)  
- **Motion Description**: Obstacle is moving away longitudinally. Obstacle is moving away laterally to the left.  
- **Trajectory Analysis**:  
  - Longitudinal distance is increasing (from -16.44 m at 0.1s to -22.22 m at 0.9s).  
  - Lateral distance is increasing (from 0.00 m at 0.1s to 3.12 m at 0.9s).  
  - The obstacle is moving diagonally away from the ego car (left and backward).  

- **Time-to-Collision (TTC)**:  
  - Longitudinal TTC = Not applicable (moving away).  
  - Lateral TTC = Not applicable (moving away).  

- **Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC)**:  
  - The obstacle is moving away in both dimensions. The MDC is the current lateral distance (3.12 m), which is Low Risk (3.0 < MDC ≤ 5.0).  

- **Overall Risk**:  
  - No Risk (5) since both TTC and MDC indicate no immediate danger.

### Collision Scenario Determination
- Neither obstacle has a risk score of 0 (Collision) or 1 (Extreme Risk).  
- Both obstacles are moving away from the ego car, with increasing distances in both longitudinal and lateral dimensions.  
- No imminent collision risk is present.
