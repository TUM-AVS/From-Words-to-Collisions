### Obstacle-by-Obstacle Analysis

#### Obstacle 30312 (Front-Left):
- **Most Recent Timestep (0.9 seconds):**
  - **Adjusted Distances**: Longitudinal = 20.22 m, Lateral = 2.42 m
  - **Relative Velocities**: Longitudinal = -0.46 m/s, Lateral = 1.84 m/s
  - **Trajectory/Motion**: Moving toward the ego car longitudinally but moving away laterally.
  
- **Trajectory Analysis Across Timesteps:**
  - The obstacle's longitudinal distance is gradually decreasing, indicating movement towards the ego over time.
  - Lateral distance is increasing, suggesting it's moving further to the left away from the ego vehicle's path.

- **TTC Calculation:**
  - Longitudinal TTC = |20.22 m / 0.46 m/s| = 43.96 seconds (no risk, as there's still considerable distance being slowly closed and lateral movement is away)
  - Lateral distance is increasing, mitigating collision risk.

- **MDC Calculation:**
  - Longitudinal MDC = 20.22 m
  - Lateral MDC = 2.42 m

- **Risk Assessment:**
  - Both longitudinal and lateral MDC values significantly exceed 5.0 meters, and the trajectory shows divergence laterally.
  - **Overall Risk Score**: 5 (No Risk)

#### Obstacle 30321 (Rear-Left):
- **Most Recent Timestep (0.9 seconds):**
  - **Adjusted Distances**: Longitudinal = -22.22 m, Lateral = 3.12 m
  - **Relative Velocities**: Longitudinal = -6.98 m/s, Lateral = 6.15 m/s
  - **Trajectory/Motion**: Moving away longitudinally and laterally to the left.
  
- **Trajectory Analysis Across Timesteps:**
  - The obstacle continues to increase its distance longitudinally from the ego vehicle.
  - Lateral movement away from the vehicle is evident as distances are growing.

- **TTC Calculation:**
  - No meaningful TTC even considered since the vehicle is continually moving away in both dimensions.

- **MDC Calculation:**
  - Longitudinal MDC is irrelevant for rear-moving objects when increasing, significant at >20m.
  - Lateral MDC = 3.12 m

- **Risk Assessment:**
  - There is no risk given the increasing separation in both directions.
  - **Overall Risk Score**: 5 (No Risk)

### Final Determination:
Neither obstacle presents any substantial collision risk at this timestep according to their respective places and trajectories.

### Conclusion:
This is not a collision scenario.
