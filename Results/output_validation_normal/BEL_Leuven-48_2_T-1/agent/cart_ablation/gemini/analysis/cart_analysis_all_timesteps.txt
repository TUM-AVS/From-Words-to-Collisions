The ego vehicle and obstacle 30118.0 are initially in different lanelets.  However, over the provided time steps, their positions get closer and they both end up in lanelet 458 (ego at 0.7s, obstacle a bit earlier).  The distance between them decreases, and their velocities are similar in magnitude.  Although the obstacle is decelerating more strongly than the ego vehicle, the current trajectories suggest a high risk of collision in the near future.  The fact that they are converging on the same lanelet increases the likelihood of this collision. A collision isn't certain within the timeframe given, but it's highly probable without corrective action.
