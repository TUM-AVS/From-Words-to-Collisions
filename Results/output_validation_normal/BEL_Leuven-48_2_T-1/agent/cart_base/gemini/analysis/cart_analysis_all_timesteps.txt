The ego vehicle and obstacle 30118.0 are initially in different lanelets. However, over the provided time steps, their positions get closer, and importantly, at t=0.7s, the ego vehicle transitions into lanelet 458.0, the same lanelet as the obstacle.  At t=0.9s, the ego vehicle is at (201.3275, -432.9576) while the obstacle is at (216.6353, -424.1223). While the y-coordinates suggest a lateral separation, the x-coordinates indicate the obstacle is only about 15 units ahead of the ego vehicle and both are decelerating.  This, combined with the lane change, makes a collision highly likely in the near future if the ego vehicle doesn't brake more significantly. This situation constitutes an extreme risk.
