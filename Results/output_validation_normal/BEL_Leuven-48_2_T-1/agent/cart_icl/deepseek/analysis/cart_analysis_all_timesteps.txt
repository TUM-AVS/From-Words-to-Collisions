### Analysis:

1. **Relative Motion and Trajectory**:
   - **Ego Vehicle (30119.0)**:
     - Position: (201.3275, -432.9576) at 0.9s
     - Velocity: 12.4619 m/s (decelerating)
     - Orientation: 0.5225 radians (~30 degrees)
     - Lanelet: 458.0
   - **Obstacle (30118.0)**:
     - Position: (216.6353, -424.1223) at 0.9s
     - Velocity: 13.197 m/s (decelerating)
     - Orientation: 0.5242 radians (~30 degrees)
     - Lanelet: 1040.0

2. **Distance and TTC**:
   - **Relative Distance**: 
     - Longitudinal: ~15.31 m (obstacle ahead)
     - Lateral: ~8.84 m (obstacle to the right)
   - **Relative Velocity**: 
     - Longitudinal: 0.7351 m/s (obstacle moving away)
     - Lateral: Minimal (similar orientations)
   - **TTC**: 
     - Not applicable (obstacle is moving away longitudinally, and lateral distance is large).

3. **Risk Assessment**:
   - The obstacle is in a different lanelet (1040.0 vs. ego's 458.0) and is moving away from the ego vehicle. The lateral distance is significant (~8.84 m), and the relative velocity indicates no immediate risk of collision.
   - **Overall Risk Score**: 5 (Negligible Risk).
