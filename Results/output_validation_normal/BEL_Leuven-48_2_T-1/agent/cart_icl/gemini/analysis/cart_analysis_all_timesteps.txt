At t=0.9s, the ego vehicle (ID 30119) is at (201.3275, -432.9576) in lanelet 458, while the obstacle (ID 30118) is at (216.6353, -424.1223) in lanelet 1040.

Analyzing the trajectories, both the ego vehicle and the obstacle seem to be moving in a roughly parallel direction, but the obstacle is ahead and slightly to the ego vehicle's left.

Calculating approximate TTC and MDC requires relative velocity and position.

* **Relative Position (x, y):** (216.6353 - 201.3275, -424.1223 - (-432.9576)) = (15.3078, 8.8353) meters.
* **Relative Velocity:**  Obstacle velocity and ego velocity are not directly comparable due to different orientations.  However, based on the change in position over the last few timesteps, we can approximate.
    * Ego's approximate velocity (x, y) from 0.8s to 0.9s: (201.3275 - 200.2353, -432.9576 - (-433.5866)) = (1.0922, 0.629) m/s
    * Obstacle's approximate velocity (x, y) from 0.8s to 0.9s: (216.6353 - 215.4832, -424.1223 - (-424.7886)) = (1.1521, 0.6663) m/s
    * Relative velocity (x, y): (1.1521-1.0922, 0.6663-0.629) = (0.0599, 0.0373) m/s.


A simple TTC calculation using longitudinal distance (15.3078m) and relative longitudinal velocity (0.0599 m/s) yields TTC ≈ 255 seconds. This extremely high TTC suggests no immediate collision risk. MDC, based on the current positions, is approximately sqrt(15.3078² + 8.8353²) ≈ 17.7m. However, given the nearly parallel trajectories and slow relative velocity, the MDC isn't decreasing rapidly.



The lanelet changes suggest a lane change maneuver.  While the data doesn't definitively indicate a risky situation at this moment (0.9s), caution is warranted as the ego vehicle has entered lanelet 458 while the obstacle is seemingly moving towards lanelet 1040 from lanelet 458.  Further analysis of subsequent timesteps is essential to confirm safety. However, based on the available data, the risk is currently low.
