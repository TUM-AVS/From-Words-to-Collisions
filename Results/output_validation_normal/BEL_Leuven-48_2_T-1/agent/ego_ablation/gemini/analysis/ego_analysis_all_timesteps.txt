At t=0.9s, obstacle 30118 is 13.17m ahead of the ego vehicle and moving away longitudinally at 0.74 m/s.  The lateral distance is 0.0m and the lateral velocity is minimal (0.02 m/s) indicating that, along with its current trajectory the obstacle would eventually cause a collision if all the current velocities and accelerations were maintained indefinitely. However, the scenario does not provide sufficient information to predict their future trajectories and make a certain conclusion about this possibility. This information does not signify extreme risk nor high risk given the longitudinal distance and separation velocity.
