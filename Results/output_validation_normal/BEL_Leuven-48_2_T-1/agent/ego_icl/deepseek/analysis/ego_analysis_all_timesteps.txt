### Obstacle Analysis: Obstacle 30118

#### Trajectory Analysis:
- **Direction**: Front of the ego car (longitudinal alignment)
- **Longitudinal Distance**: Increasing from 11.81m to 13.17m over 0.9 seconds (moving away)
- **Lateral Distance**: Consistently 0.00m (exact lateral alignment)
- **Relative Velocity**: 
  - Longitudinal: Decreasing from 3.08 m/s to 0.74 m/s (moving away, but slowing down)
  - Lateral: Minimal (0.15 m/s to 0.02 m/s, negligible)
- **Relative Acceleration**: 
  - Longitudinal: Negative (-2.74 m/s² to -3.11 m/s², decelerating)
  - Lateral: Negative (-1.59 m/s² to -1.80 m/s², negligible)
- **Motion Description**: "Obstacle is moving away longitudinally. Exact lateral alignment or unknown case."

#### Risk Assessment:
1. **Proximity**: 
   - Longitudinal: 13.17m (far away)
   - Lateral: 0.00m (aligned but not closing)
2. **Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC)**:
   - Since the obstacle is moving away longitudinally and laterally stable, MDC is effectively infinite (no collision course).
3. **Time-to-Collision (TTC)**:
   - Longitudinal: Distance is increasing (relative velocity is positive but decreasing). TTC is not applicable (no collision course).
   - Lateral: Negligible relative velocity (0.02 m/s), so TTC is not applicable.

#### Risk Level:
- **MDC**: > 5.0m (No Risk - 5)
- **TTC**: Not applicable (No Risk - 5)
- **Overall Risk**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
