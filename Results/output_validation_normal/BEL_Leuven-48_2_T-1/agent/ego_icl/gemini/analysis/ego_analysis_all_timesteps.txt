Obstacle 30118 is in front of the ego vehicle and moving away longitudinally. The lateral distance is consistently 0.00m, indicating the obstacle is in the same lane as the ego vehicle.  The longitudinal distance is increasing across all timesteps, from 11.81m to 13.17m. The relative longitudinal velocity is positive initially but decreases over time, eventually becoming 0.74 m/s at the last timestep (0.9 seconds). This decreasing positive velocity coupled with the increasing longitudinal distance confirms that the obstacle is moving away from the ego vehicle, despite being in the same lane.

Given the increasing longitudinal distance and the relatively slow positive longitudinal velocity at the last timestep, a collision is not imminent.  The MDC is 13.17m and with a relative velocity of 0.74m/s the calculated TTC is 17.80s.  This high TTC value supports the assessment of minimal risk.

**Risk Assessment for Obstacle 30118:**
* **MDC:** 13.17m (Negligible Risk)
* **TTC:** 17.80s (Negligible Risk)
* **Overall Risk:** 5 (Negligible Risk)
