### Obstacle Analysis

**Obstacle 30118**
- Location: Front of ego vehicle
- Adjusted Distances at 0.9 seconds: 
  - Longitudinal: 13.17 m
  - Lateral: 0.00 m (exact lateral alignment, not a collision since the longitudinal distance isn't near zero)
- Relative Velocity at 0.9 seconds:
  - Longitudinal: 0.74 m/s (moving away)
  - Lateral: 0.02 m/s (minimal lateral movement)
- Relative Acceleration at 0.9 seconds: 
  - Longitudinal: -3.11 m/s² (decelerating further)
  - Lateral: -1.80 m/s²

#### Trajectory Analysis
- From 0.0 to 0.9 seconds, the obstacle has consistently increased its longitudinal distance from the ego vehicle, indicating it is moving away, albeit slowing down over time.
- Longitudinal relative velocity is decreasing over time, suggesting the obstacle is slowing down further as it moves away, resulting in positive (increasing longitudinal distance).

#### Time-to-Collision (TTC) Calculation
- Since the obstacle is moving away and the longitudinal distance is increasing, TTC becomes irrelevant for collision assessment because the paths are diverging.

#### Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC) Calculation
- MDC primarily considers the longitudinal dimension due to alignment, and is equal to the longitudinal distance of 13.17 m.

### Risk Assessment
- The increasing longitudinal distance and the positive relative velocity (obstacle moving away) combined with a significant MDC imply negligible risk.
- The overall risk score, being based on increasing distance and no imminent path convergence, aligns with a "No Risk" scenario.
