At t=0.9s, the ego vehicle (30119.0) is at (201.3275, -432.9576) in lanelet 458.0, while the obstacle (30118.0) is at (216.6353, -424.1223) in lanelet 1040.0.  While the lanelets are now different, the obstacle's y-coordinate is significantly less than the ego's, indicating potential lane change/crossing by the obstacle. Combined with the decreasing distance between the vehicles over the preceding timesteps, this suggests a high risk of collision. Further, the ego and obstacle speeds indicate closing velocities.  Therefore, I classify this as an extreme risk (1).
