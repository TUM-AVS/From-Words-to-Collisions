At t=0.9s, the ego vehicle (ID 30119.0) is at (201.3275, -432.9576) in lanelet 458.0, while the obstacle (ID 30118.0) is at (216.6353, -424.1223) in lanelet 1040.0. While the y-coordinates suggest a potential lane change maneuver by the ego vehicle, the x-coordinate difference of approximately 15.3 and the different lanelets indicate a safe separation at this timestep.  The vehicles' trajectories over the preceding timesteps (0.0s-0.8s) also suggest diverging paths. Therefore, no immediate collision risk is apparent.
