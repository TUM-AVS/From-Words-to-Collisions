### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep (0.9 seconds):

### Obstacle Analysis:
- **Obstacle ID**: 30118.0  
  - **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is in lanelet 1040.0, while the ego vehicle is in lanelet 458.0. The lateral distance between them is significant, and their trajectories are not converging. The obstacle is moving away from the ego vehicle's path.  
  - **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)  
  - **Time Risk reason**: The obstacle's velocity (13.197) is higher than the ego's (12.4619), and both are decelerating. The relative velocity is small, and the distance is increasing over time.  
  - **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)  
  - **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low Risk)  

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. **Lanelet Analysis**: The ego vehicle and obstacle are in different lanelets (458.0 vs. 1040.0), indicating no immediate overlap in paths.  
2. **Trajectory Trends**: The obstacle is consistently ahead of the ego vehicle and moving away, as seen from the increasing distance over timesteps.  
3. **Velocity/Acceleration**: Both vehicles are decelerating, but the obstacle maintains a higher speed, reducing collision risk.  
4. **TTC/MDC**: No imminent collision risk due to divergent paths and increasing separation.
