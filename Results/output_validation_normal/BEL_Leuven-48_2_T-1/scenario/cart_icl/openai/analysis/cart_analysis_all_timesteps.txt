### Obstacle Analysis:

#### Obstacle ID: 30116
- **Distance Risk reason:** Obstacle 30116 is located in a different lanelet at the most recent timestep and is moving away with a consistent direction change towards less alignment with the Ego vehicle.
- **Distance safety score:** 5
- **Time Risk reason:** The relative velocity is greater than the Ego, moving out of collision trajectory and accelerating, reducing collision possibility with time.
- **Time safety score:** 5
- **Overall Risk score:** 5

#### Obstacle ID: 30117
- **Distance Risk reason:** Positioned persistently in a different lanelet from the Ego and consistently moves further away.
- **Distance safety score:** 5
- **Time Risk reason:** The relative deceleration trend is negative but distance and lanelet separation reduce collision threat.
- **Time safety score:** 4
- **Overall Risk score:** 4.5

#### Obstacle ID: 30118
- **Distance Risk reason:** Obstacle 30118 is in a parallel and adjacent corridor, moving consistently without crossing paths with the Ego trajectory.
- **Distance safety score:** 5
- **Time Risk reason:** Steady deceleration while keeping distance and maintaining the position in adjoining lanelets helps avoid collision likelihood.
- **Time safety score:** 4
- **Overall Risk score:** 4.5

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
There is no collision scenario present. All obstacles are maintaining relative trajectories away from the Ego, with no lane crossing or immediate proximal threat at the latest timestep. Calculated metrics (TTC, MDC) confirm the safety with substantial future safety margins.
