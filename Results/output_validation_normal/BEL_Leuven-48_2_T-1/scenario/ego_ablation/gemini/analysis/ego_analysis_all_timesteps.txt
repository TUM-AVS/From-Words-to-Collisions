Obstacle 30118 is moving away from the ego vehicle both longitudinally and laterally. The longitudinal distance is increasing, and the relative longitudinal velocity is positive but decreasing, suggesting the obstacle is decelerating less than the ego vehicle or accelerating in the same direction.  The lateral distance is essentially zero, but the lateral velocity is also minimal and decreasing. Given the current trend, a collision is unlikely.
