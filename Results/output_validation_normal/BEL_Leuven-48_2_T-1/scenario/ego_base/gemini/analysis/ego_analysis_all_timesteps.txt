Obstacle 30118 is moving away longitudinally from the ego vehicle. At the most recent timestep (0.9 seconds), it is 13.17 meters in front of the ego vehicle and has a relative longitudinal velocity of 0.74 m/s, meaning it's still moving away, although at a decreasing rate. The lateral velocity is only 0.02 m/s and the lateral distance is 0.00 m suggesting a near-perfect lateral alignment with the ego vehicle. Although it's slowing down significantly as indicated by the negative relative longitudinal acceleration (-3.11 m/sÂ²), there appears to be no immediate danger of collision at this particular moment. Given the current trend, the risk is assessed as low.
