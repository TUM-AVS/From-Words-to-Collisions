### Obstacle-by-Obstacle Analysis

#### Obstacle 30118 (Most Recent Timestep: 0.9 seconds)
- **Direction**: Front of the ego car
- **Adjusted Distances**: 
  - Longitudinal: 13.17 m (increasing over time)
  - Lateral: 0.00 m (exact alignment, but stable)
- **Relative Velocity**: 
  - Longitudinal: 0.74 m/s (moving away)
  - Lateral: 0.02 m/s (negligible)
- **Relative Acceleration**: 
  - Longitudinal: -3.11 m/s² (decelerating away)
  - Lateral: -1.80 m/s² (stable alignment)
- **Motion Description**: "Obstacle is moving away longitudinally. Exact lateral alignment or unknown case."

#### Trajectory Analysis (0.1s to 0.9s)
- **Longitudinal Distance**: Consistently increasing (11.81m → 13.17m)
- **Lateral Distance**: Stable at 0.00m (no deviation)
- **Relative Velocity**: 
  - Longitudinal: Decreasing (3.08 m/s → 0.74 m/s, moving away)
  - Lateral: Very small (0.15 m/s → 0.02 m/s, negligible)
- **Acceleration**: 
  - Longitudinal: Negative (decelerating away)
  - Lateral: Negative (stable alignment)

#### TTC Calculation
- **Longitudinal TTC**: Not applicable (relative velocity is positive but distance is increasing, so no collision course)
- **Lateral TTC**: Not applicable (relative velocity is negligible and distance is stable)
- **Overall TTC**: No meaningful TTC (paths are diverging or stable)

#### MDC Calculation
- **Longitudinal MDC**: 13.17 m (No Risk, MDC > 5.0m)
- **Lateral MDC**: 0.00 m (but stable alignment, no convergence)
- **Overall MDC**: Since lateral alignment is stable and longitudinal distance is increasing, the effective MDC is effectively infinite (no collision path).

#### Risk Assessment
- **TTC Risk**: 5 (No Risk, no collision path)
- **MDC Risk**: 5 (No Risk, stable or increasing distances)
- **Overall Risk**: 5 (No Risk)

### Conclusion
- No collision or extreme risk is detected.
- Obstacle 30118 is moving away longitudinally with stable lateral alignment.
- Both TTC and MDC indicate no risk of collision.
