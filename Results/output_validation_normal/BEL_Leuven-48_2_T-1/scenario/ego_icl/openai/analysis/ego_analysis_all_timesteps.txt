### Obstacle-by-Obstacle Analysis

**Obstacle ID: 30118**

- **Position Analysis:**
  - At 0.9 seconds: 
    - Adjusted longitudinal distance = 13.17 meters
    - Adjusted lateral distance = 0.00 meters
    - Relative velocity longitudinal = 0.74 m/s (moving away longitudinally)
    - Relative velocity lateral = 0.02 m/s (almost no lateral movement)
    - Motion: Obstacle is moving away longitudinally with an exact lateral alignment

- **Trajectory Analysis Across Timesteps:**
  - From 0.1 to 0.9 seconds, the obstacle has been consistently moving away from the ego vehicle longitudinally. The lateral position indicates exact alignment throughout this period.

- **TTC Calculation:**  
  - Longitudinal TTC = Longitudinal Distance / |Relative Longitudinal Velocity| = 13.17 m / 0.74 m/s â‰ˆ 17.80 seconds
  - Lateral movement is negligible; hence, lateral TTC is not applicable.

- **MDC Calculation:**
  - Since the obstacle is moving away, MDC is effectively the increasing longitudinal distance. Thus, no concerning minimum distance at this time.
  - Longitudinal distances have been increasing over time.

- **Risk Assessment:**
  - Longitudinal TTC > 5.0 seconds, indicating No Risk in the longitudinal dimension.
  - MDC is greater than 5.0 meters as the distances are increasing; hence there is No Risk.
  - Overall Risk Score = 5 (No Risk)

### Conclusion:
- **Is this a collision scenario?** No
- Obstacle 30118 presents an overall risk score of 5 (No Risk), as both TTC and MDC indicate a safe divergence from the ego vehicle.
