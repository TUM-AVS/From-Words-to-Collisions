The ego vehicle and obstacle 30118.0 are in relatively close proximity and their lanelets change throughout the provided timesteps. Initially, they are in adjacent lanelets (460 and 458 respectively).  The obstacle's lane changes to 1040, which appears to be near or merge with the ego vehicle's lanelet (which changes to 1041). Both are decelerating, but the lateral distance between them is decreasing over the timesteps.  While not immediately colliding, the decreasing distance and lane changes suggest a potential for collision if these trends continue. This warrants at least a high-risk assessment.
