The ego vehicle (ID 30119.0) and the obstacle (ID 30118.0) are initially in different lanelets (460 and 458 respectively).  Over the time steps, their lateral positions become closer. The obstacle's lanelet changes to 1040, which appears to be close to the ego vehicle's lanelet 1041. Both vehicles are decelerating, but the longitudinal distance between them is decreasing, suggesting a potential rear-end collision risk if this trend continues. The lateral distance is also quite small, indicating a high probability of collision if the vehicles remain on their current trajectories. Therefore, the obstacle poses an extreme risk.
