At t=0.9s, the ego vehicle (ID 30119.0) is at (196.5802, -435.6782) with a velocity of 13.815 and the obstacle (ID 30118.0) is at (213.7738, -425.7732) with a velocity of 12.714.  Both are decelerating.  The obstacle is located roughly northeast relative to the ego vehicle and in a different lane (1041 vs 1040).  The data shows that the vehicles are moving roughly parallel and have been for the last 0.9 seconds of recorded data.

**Calculations and Reasoning:**

1. **Lateral Distance:**  The lateral distance between the vehicles at t=0.9s is approximately `abs(-425.7732 - -435.6782) ≈ 9.905`.  This distance is steadily decreasing over the observed time steps, but both vehicles appear to be maintaining their lanes, which are parallel.  Although the vehicles are moving generally in the same direction, their slight orientation differences combined with decelerating speeds makes collision prediction via simple extrapolation unreliable.

2. **Longitudinal Distance:** The longitudinal distance is `abs(213.7738 - 196.5802) ≈ 17.1936`. This distance is also decreasing, but at a slower rate than the lateral distance.  It appears as if the obstacle is slowly pulling ahead.

3. **TTC (Approximation):**  Accurately calculating TTC requires precise knowledge of future trajectories, which we don't have.  However, a rough estimate can be made using current velocities and distances. For lateral distance,  9.905 / (rate of lateral distance change over recent timestamps) will give a crude TTC estimate.  Similar can be done with longitudinal distance.  However, it's clear that at least for 0.9 seconds, the vehicles have been more or less maintaining their respective lanes so far.  It's unclear with the given data, that they won't continue to do so.

4. **MDC:**  The Minimum Distance between Centers at t=0.9s is calculated as the Euclidean distance. `sqrt((213.7738 - 196.5802)^2 + (-425.7732 - -435.6782)^2) ≈ 19.98`.  This distance is decreasing over subsequent time steps.


**Risk Assessment:**

Given the lane markings and reasonably maintained lateral distance, there is no immediate risk of collision despite both vehicles being in relatively close proximity.  However, the data needs to be monitored to be sure the relative trajectories don't converge unexpectedly.

* **Position:**  Medium Risk (3) - Vehicles are relatively close but in different lanes.
* **Velocity:**  Medium Risk (3) - The velocities are similar and along parallel directions, so there is no immediate cause for alarm, but monitoring is essential.
* **Acceleration:** Low Risk (4) - Deceleration is occurring for both vehicles, likely reducing the risk of a collision.
* **Orientation:** Medium Risk (3) -Orientations are similar and not immediately threatening, but any significant change could increase the risk.

**Overall Risk Score:**  I conclude the obstacle presents a `Medium Risk (3)` due to the proximity and decreasing MDC. Although they are currently in different lanes, continued monitoring is necessary.
