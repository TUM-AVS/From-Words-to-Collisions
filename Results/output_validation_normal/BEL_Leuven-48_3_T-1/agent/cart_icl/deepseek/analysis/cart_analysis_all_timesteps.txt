### Analysis:

1. **Obstacle 30118 (Most Recent Timestep - 0.9s):**
   - **Position (Ego vs. Obstacle):** Ego (196.5802, -435.6782), Obstacle (213.7738, -425.7732)
   - **Relative Distance:** 
     - Longitudinal: ~17.19m (obstacle ahead of ego)
     - Lateral: ~9.905m (obstacle to the right of ego)
   - **Velocity (Ego vs. Obstacle):** Ego (13.815 m/s), Obstacle (12.714 m/s)
   - **Relative Velocity:** 1.101 m/s (ego is closing the gap slowly)
   - **TTC:** 17.19 / 1.101 â‰ˆ 15.61s (very high, no immediate risk)
   - **MDC:** The lateral distance (~9.905m) is significant, and the trajectories are diverging (different lanelets: ego in 1041.0, obstacle in 1040.0). No risk of collision.

2. **Motion Trends:**
   - The ego and obstacle are moving in parallel lanelets (460.0/458.0 initially, then 1041.0/1040.0).
   - The lateral distance remains large (~9-10m), and the longitudinal distance increases slightly over time (obstacle is slowing faster than ego).
   - No intersection or convergence of trajectories observed.

3. **Risk Assessment:**
   - **Overall Risk Score:** 5 (Negligible Risk) for Obstacle 30118. No collision or immediate risk due to large lateral separation and stable TTC.
