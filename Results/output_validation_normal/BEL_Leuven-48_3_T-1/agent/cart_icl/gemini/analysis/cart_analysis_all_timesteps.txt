At t=0.9s, the ego vehicle (ID 30119) is at (196.5802, -435.6782) with a velocity of 13.815 m/s and the obstacle (ID 30118) is at (213.7738, -425.7732) with a velocity of 12.714 m/s.

The obstacle is ahead and to the left of the ego vehicle.  The lateral distance is approximately sqrt((213.7738-196.5802)^2 + (-425.7732 - -435.6782)^2) = 18.85m. The longitudinal distance is approximately 17.19m.

Looking at the trends from t=0.1s to t=0.9s, both vehicles are decelerating.  The relative velocity is small, but the vehicles are approaching each other over the timeframe with relatively small accelerations in magnitude. This suggests a medium-term potential for collision, although not immediate.

The change in x over this period is approximately 16m for the ego vehicle, compared to 10m for the obstacle. The change in y for the ego vehicle is about 7.5m, compared to 6m for the obstacle.

Given the lateral distance, longitudinal distance and relative velocities and accelerations, the risk appears to be medium. If both maintain their current deceleration rates, the risk would decrease. However, if either vehicle ceases decelerating, the risk increases.

Since there are no immediate collision risks (TTC > 1s and MDC > safe distance), there are no obstacles with a risk score of 0 or 1. Based on the provided data, the obstacle has a medium risk due to its proximity and converging trajectory. This suggests that we have ample time to react.
