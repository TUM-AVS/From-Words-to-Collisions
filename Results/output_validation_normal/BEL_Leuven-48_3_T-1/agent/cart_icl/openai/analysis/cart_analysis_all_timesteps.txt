To analyze the scenario effectively, we examine the motion of both the ego vehicle (ID: 30119.0) and the obstacle (ID: 30118.0). 

### Evaluation Analysis:
At the latest timestamp (0.9 seconds), we have:
- **Position**:
  - **Ego**: (196.5802, -435.6782)
  - **Obstacle**: (213.7738, -425.7732)

- **Velocity**:
  - **Ego**: 13.815 m/s
  - **Obstacle**: 12.714 m/s

- **Acceleration**:
  - **Ego**: -0.7215 m/s²
  - **Obstacle**: -4.5138 m/s²

- **Lanelet**:
  - **Ego**: 1041.0
  - **Obstacle**: 1040.0

### Relative Motion Analysis:
- The ego and obstacle vehicles are in neighboring lanelets (1041.0 and 1040.0, respectively), meaning they are parallel but not in the same lane.
- **Longitudinal distance**: The obstacle's position in front in the longitudinal direction: Δx = 213.7738 - 196.5802 = 17.1936 meters.
- **Lateral distance**: The obstacle is to the side, Δy = |-425.7732 - (-435.6782)| = 9.905 meters.

### TTC (Time to Collision) and MDC (Minimum Distance to Collision):
- The ego vehicle's orientation and velocity indicate it's moving roughly parallel to the obstacle. 
- Due to the significant lateral separation and movement in different lanelets, the risk of collision is low.
- **TTC**: The vehicles are neither closing in rapidly nor on a collision course at the current trajectory, given the maintaining lateral separation and slowing velocities.

### Risk Assessment:
- Given the lateral distance and current velocity dynamics, both vehicles pose a **Negligible Risk** (5).

### JSON Output:
```json
{
    "CollisionObstacles": [],
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {},
    "HighRiskObstacle": {}
}
```

No specific obstacles require further detailed analysis as their relative positions and velocities, combined with the lane change position, demonstrate no immediate collision threat or extreme risk scenario.
