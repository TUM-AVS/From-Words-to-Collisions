At t=0.9s, obstacle 30118 is 15.33m directly in front of the ego vehicle.  It is moving towards the ego vehicle longitudinally at -1.10 m/s and laterally at 0.18 m/s. While the lateral movement is minimal and shouldn't pose an immediate threat, the longitudinal closing velocity suggests a potential risk. However, given the current distance and relative speeds, there is still time and space for the ego vehicle to react. Therefore, I classify this obstacle as medium risk (3). No extreme or collision risk is present.
