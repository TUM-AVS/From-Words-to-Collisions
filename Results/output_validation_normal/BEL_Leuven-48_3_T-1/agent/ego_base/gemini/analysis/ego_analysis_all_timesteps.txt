At t=0.9s, obstacle 30118 is 15.33m in front of the ego vehicle and directly ahead (lateral 0.00m).  It is moving towards the ego vehicle at -1.10 m/s longitudinally and slightly to the right at 0.18 m/s laterally. The negative longitudinal velocity indicates closing the distance. While the distance is currently safe, the closing velocity suggests a potential risk if this trend continues. This warrants a higher risk level than negligible, though not yet extreme. A medium risk level seems appropriate given the available time to react.
