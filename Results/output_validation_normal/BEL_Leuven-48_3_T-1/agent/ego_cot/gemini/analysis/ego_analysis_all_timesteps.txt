### Safety analysis for timestep 0.9s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 30118
- Distance Risk reason: At 0.9 seconds, the obstacle is 15.33m longitudinally and laterally away from the ego vehicle.  While the obstacle *is* moving closer longitudinally, it is still relatively far away.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: While the obstacle's longitudinal velocity is negative (towards the ego vehicle), the magnitude is small (-1.10 m/s) and the distance is large.  Additionally, the lateral velocity (0.18 m/s) indicates a diverging path.  Calculating an exact TTC is difficult without precise trajectory predictions, but the current data suggests ample time to react.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4
