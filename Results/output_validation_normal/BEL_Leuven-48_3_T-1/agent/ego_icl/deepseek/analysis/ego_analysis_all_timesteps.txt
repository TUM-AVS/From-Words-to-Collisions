### Obstacle-by-Obstacle Analysis:

#### Obstacle 30118 (Front of ego car)
- **Most Recent Timestep (0.9s):**
  - **Adjusted Distance:** Longitudinal 15.33 m, Lateral 0.00 m
  - **Relative Velocity:** Longitudinal -1.10 m/s (approaching), Lateral 0.18 m/s (moving slightly away)
  - **Motion Description:** "Obstacle is driving toward the ego car longitudinally. Exact lateral alignment or unknown case."
  - **Trajectory Analysis:**
    - Initially moving away longitudinally (0.1s to 0.4s), then starts approaching (0.5s onwards).
    - Lateral distance remains 0.00 m (same lane alignment), but lateral velocity is slightly positive (moving away).

- **TTC Calculation:**
  - Longitudinal TTC = 15.33 m / 1.10 m/s = ~13.94 s (No Risk, TTC > 5.0s)
  - Lateral TTC: Not applicable (lateral velocity is positive, moving away)
  - **Effective TTC:** Longitudinal TTC dominates (13.94s)

- **MDC Calculation:**
  - Longitudinal MDC: 15.33 m (Low Risk, MDC > 5.0m)
  - Lateral MDC: 0.00 m (but lateral velocity is positive, so no collision risk)
  - **Effective MDC:** Longitudinal MDC dominates (15.33m)

- **Risk Assessment:**
  - TTC: 5 (No Risk)
  - MDC: 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Overall Risk Score:** 4 (Low Risk) - No immediate collision threat.

### Reasoning:
- Obstacle 30118 is longitudinally aligned (same lane) but at a safe distance (15.33m) and closing slowly (1.10 m/s). The TTC is very high (~13.94s), and the MDC is also large (15.33m). The lateral distance is 0.00m, but the obstacle is moving slightly away laterally (0.18 m/s), so no collision risk exists in that dimension. The overall risk is **Low (4)**. No collision or extreme/high-risk obstacles are present.
