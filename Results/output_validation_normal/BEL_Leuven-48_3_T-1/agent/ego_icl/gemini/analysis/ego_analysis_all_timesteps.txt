Obstacle 30118 is in front of the ego vehicle and has been consistently in the front throughout the provided timesteps. Initially, it was moving away from the ego vehicle longitudinally, but in the last few timesteps, its motion reversed and it started approaching the ego vehicle. The lateral distance remains consistently at 0.00 m, suggesting exact lateral alignment or an unknown case, possibly due to sensor limitations or data processing.

At the last timestep (0.9 seconds), the longitudinal distance is 15.33 m, and the relative longitudinal velocity is -1.10 m/s (approaching).  The lateral velocity is 0.18 m/s which implies some lateral movement might occur.

TTC Calculation (Longitudinal):
TTC = Distance / |Relative Velocity| = 15.33 m / |-1.10 m/s| = 13.94 seconds

MDC Calculation:
Given the persistent lateral alignment, the MDC is primarily determined by the longitudinal distance.  While the lateral velocity is non-zero, its value is minimal, therefore MDC â‰ˆ 15.33 m.

Risk Assessment:
Based on the MDC and TTC calculations:

* MDC Risk: 5 (Negligible Risk) - MDC > 5.0m
* TTC Risk: 5 (Negligible Risk) - TTC > 5.0s

Overall Risk: 5 (Negligible Risk) - Both MDC and TTC indicate no significant risk.  Although the obstacle is approaching, the distance is substantial, and the closing speed is relatively low.
