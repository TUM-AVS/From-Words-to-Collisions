### Obstacle-by-Obstacle Analysis

**Obstacle 30118**

**Trajectory Analysis:**
- The obstacle has been observed over several timesteps (0.0 to 0.9 seconds).
- Initially, it was slowly moving away from the ego vehicle (increasing longitudinal distance) but has started moving towards the ego vehicle after 0.5 seconds (decreasing longitudinal distance).

**At 0.9 seconds (most recent timestamp):**
- **Adjusted Longitudinal Distance:** Approximately 15.33 m (decreasing)
- **Adjusted Lateral Distance:** 0.00 m (same-lane alignment)
- **Relative Velocity (Longitudinal):** -1.10 m/s (obstacle is closing in)
- **Relative Velocity (Lateral):** 0.18 m/s (slightly moving sideways)
- **Relative Acceleration (Longitudinal):** -3.28 m/sÂ² (continuing to accelerate towards the ego)
- **Motion:** The obstacle is driving toward the ego vehicle longitudinally, indicating a converging trajectory.

**Calculations:**
- **Time-to-Collision (TTC) - Longitudinal:**
  - \[
  \text{TTC}_{\text{longitudinal}} = \frac{15.33}{1.10} \approx 13.94 \text{ seconds}
  \]
  Despite the closing velocity, the TTC is well over 5 seconds, which suggests no imminent collision risk.
  
- **Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC):**
  - Since lateral alignment is exact (0.00 m), the main component in focus is the longitudinal distance.
  - MDC can be considered as the current long distance of 15.33 m, indicating no immediate collision.

**Risk Level Assessment:**
- **MDC > 5.0 m** and **TTC > 5.0 s**, which falls under negligible risk.
- Longitudinal velocity shows convergence, however, the current distance and TTC do not indicate a high collision risk within the immediate timeframe.
  
**Conclusion:**
- No immediate or extreme risk present. Overall risk score reflects negligible risk level.

The evaluation shows that although the obstacle is moving towards the ego with alignment, the current risk level is negligible due to the significant distance and extended TTC.
