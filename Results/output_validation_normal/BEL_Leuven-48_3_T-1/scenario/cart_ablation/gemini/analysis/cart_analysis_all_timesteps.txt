At t=0.9s, the ego vehicle (ID 30119.0) is at (196.5802, -435.6782) in lanelet 1041.0, and the obstacle (ID 30118.0) is at (213.7738, -425.7732) in lanelet 1040.0.  The distance between them has been decreasing over the past few timesteps.  While they are in different lanelets currently, the obstacle's trajectory and deceleration suggest a possible lane change or other maneuver that could lead to an extremely high risk of collision in the next few moments. The rapid deceleration of both vehicles adds to this risk. Although not an immediate collision, the current trajectories and dynamics warrant an "Extreme Risk" assessment.

        "Reasoning": "Obstacle 30118.0 poses an extreme risk due to its decreasing distance to the ego vehicle, its trajectory, and the deceleration patterns of both vehicles, suggesting a potential lane change or other maneuver by the obstacle that could lead to a collision."
