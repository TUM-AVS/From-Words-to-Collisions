At t=0.9s, the ego vehicle (ID 30119.0) is at (196.5802, -435.6782) in lanelet 1041.0, while the obstacle (ID 30118.0) is at (213.7738, -425.7732) in lanelet 1040.0.  The distance between them has been decreasing over the past few timesteps. Although they are in different lanelets, the obstacle's trajectory and decreasing velocity suggest a possible lane change or maneuver that could lead to a collision. While not an immediate collision, the continuous approach and potential for unexpected movement from the obstacle warrant an extreme risk assessment.
