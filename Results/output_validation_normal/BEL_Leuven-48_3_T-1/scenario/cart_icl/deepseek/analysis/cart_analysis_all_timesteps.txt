### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:
- **Obstacle ID**: 30118.0  
  - **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is in a different lanelet (1040.0) compared to the ego vehicle (1041.0). The Euclidean distance between them is approximately 17.2 meters, which is relatively safe given their orientations and lane separation. Over the previous timesteps, the distance has been increasing slightly.  
  - **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)  
  - **Time Risk reason**: The relative velocity (ego: 13.815 m/s, obstacle: 12.714 m/s) is small (1.101 m/s), and both vehicles are decelerating. The time to collision (TTC) is high (~15.6 seconds), and the trend shows no immediate convergence.  
  - **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)  
  - **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low Risk)  

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. **Lanelet Separation**: The ego and obstacle are in adjacent lanelets (1041.0 and 1040.0), reducing collision risk.  
2. **Distance Trend**: The distance between them has been increasing or stable over the timesteps.  
3. **Velocity/Acceleration**: Both vehicles are decelerating, and the relative velocity is minimal.  
4. **TTC**: High TTC indicates no immediate collision risk.  
5. **Conclusion**: No collision or extreme risk detected.
