### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 30116.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is laterally separated and moving away from ego.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason:  Relative velocity and acceleration suggest no immediate risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 30117.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is laterally separated and far from ego.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Relative velocity and acceleration suggest no immediate risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 30118.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is in a different lane but longitudinally closer.  History shows it's getting closer.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Relative speeds suggest a low risk, though continued monitoring is needed.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4


### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
No obstacle poses an immediate collision risk. The ego vehicle maintains a safe distance and trajectory from all obstacles within the observed timeframe. Though obstacle 30118 is getting closer longitudinally, it remains in a different lane and current data doesn't indicate an immediate collision risk. Thus, this is not a collision scenario.
