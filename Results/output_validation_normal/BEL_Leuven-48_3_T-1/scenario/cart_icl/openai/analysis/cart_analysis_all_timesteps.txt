### Obstacle Analysis:

#### Obstacle 30116.0:
- **Distance Risk reason**: This obstacle is far from the ego vehicle and located in a different lanelet. Relative position change suggests it is on a gradual diverging path.
- **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- **Time Risk reason**: With its positive acceleration and maintained distance, collision is unlikely. The velocity trend remains fairly constant.
- **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

#### Obstacle 30117.0:
- **Distance Risk reason**: This obstacle is consistently slowing down and is located far laterally in another lanelet, indicating it is not converging towards the ego vehicle's path.
- **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- **Time Risk reason**: Steady deceleration and position imply no interception risk within the observed period. 
- **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

#### Obstacle 30118.0:
- **Distance Risk reason**: Positioned ahead in the lanelet adjacent to Ego. Showing gradual reduction in speed while keeping a consistent trajectory.
- **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
- **Time Risk reason**: The trajectory and deceleration imply that with timely adjustments, potential collision can be managed.
- **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
- **Overall Risk score**: 4

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
Based on trajectory and speed analysis, no collisions are imminent under current conditions. The timelines and distances support this assertion, as none of the obstacles pose a significant interception threat within the timeline.
