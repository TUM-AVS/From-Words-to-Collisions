Obstacle 30118 is moving towards the ego vehicle longitudinally, with a decreasing longitudinal distance.  While the lateral distance is zero (indicating perfect alignment in the ego frame), the small positive lateral velocity suggests a slight drift away, though this is happening very slowly. The longitudinal distance is still significant at 15.33m, and the relative velocity is -1.10 m/s at 0.9 seconds.  Given the moderate relative longitudinal speed and the substantial remaining distance, a collision is not imminent within the next few timesteps. It presents a potential risk if the closing velocity continues increasing, which requires attention. Hence a medium risk rating is assigned.
