Obstacle 30118 is approaching the ego vehicle longitudinally, with a decreasing distance (15.33m) and a negative relative longitudinal velocity (-1.10 m/s). While the lateral distance is zero, the small positive lateral velocity (0.18 m/s) suggests a slight lateral movement.  The negative relative acceleration indicates the closing speed is increasing. Although the obstacle is getting closer, at the current rate, a collision is not imminent in the next timestep. However, the trend suggests a potential for collision in the near future if the current dynamics continue.
