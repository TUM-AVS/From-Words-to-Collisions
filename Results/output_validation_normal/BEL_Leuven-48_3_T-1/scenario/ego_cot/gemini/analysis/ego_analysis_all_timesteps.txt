### Safety analysis for timestep 0.9 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 30118
- Distance Risk reason: At 0.9 seconds, the obstacle is 15.33m longitudinally and 15.33m laterally away from the ego vehicle. While this distance might seem substantial, the obstacle's motion and relative velocity suggest a potential risk. Although the lateral distance may appear safe, it must be noted that the description explicitly states "Exact lateral alignment or unknown case." This introduces uncertainty about the true lateral separation and necessitates careful attention.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: The obstacle's longitudinal relative velocity is -1.10 m/s (moving towards the ego vehicle) and the lateral relative velocity is 0.18m/s.  The longitudinal relative acceleration is negative, indicating the closing rate is increasing. Combining decreasing distance and increasing closing velocity points towards an increasing risk, though it is not immediate as the distances are currently substantial. We don't have enough information to calculate exact TTC values.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3

{
    "CollisionObstacle": null,
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null,
    "IsCollisionScenario": false,
    "Justification": "No immediate collision is detected. However, Obstacle 30118 presents a medium risk due to its closing longitudinal velocity and the uncertainty surrounding the lateral alignment."
