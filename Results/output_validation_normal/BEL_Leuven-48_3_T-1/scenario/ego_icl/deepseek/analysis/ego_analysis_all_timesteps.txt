### Obstacle-by-Obstacle Analysis (Most Recent Timestep: 0.9s)

#### Obstacle 30118 (Front of ego car)
- **Adjusted Distances**: 
  - Longitudinal: 15.33 m (raw distance provided, adjusted distance assumed same due to lack of explicit adjusted values)
  - Lateral: 0.00 m (exact alignment)
- **Relative Velocity**: 
  - Longitudinal: -1.10 m/s (approaching ego)
  - Lateral: 0.18 m/s (moving slightly away laterally)
- **Relative Acceleration**: 
  - Longitudinal: -3.28 m/s² (decelerating toward ego)
  - Lateral: -1.90 m/s² (decelerating laterally)
- **Motion Description**: "Obstacle is driving toward the ego car longitudinally. Exact lateral alignment or unknown case."

#### Trajectory Analysis (0.0s to 0.9s)
- Longitudinal distance decreases from 15.68m to 15.33m over 0.9s, with increasing approach velocity (from -0.13 m/s to -1.10 m/s).
- Lateral distance remains 0.00m (exact alignment), but lateral velocity is slightly positive (0.18 m/s), indicating minor divergence.

#### TTC Calculation:
- **Longitudinal TTC**: Distance / |Relative Velocity| = 15.33 / 1.10 ≈ 13.94 seconds (No Risk, TTC > 5s)
- **Lateral TTC**: Not applicable (lateral distance stable/increasing)

#### MDC Calculation:
- **Longitudinal MDC**: 15.33 m (No Risk, MDC > 5m)
- **Lateral MDC**: 0.00 m (alignment, but no convergence)

#### Risk Assessment:
- **Primary Risk**: Longitudinal approach (TTC = 13.94s, MDC = 15.33m) → **No Risk (5)**
- **Lateral Risk**: Exact alignment but diverging (lateral velocity positive) → **No Risk (5)**
- **Overall Risk**: **No Risk (5)** (no imminent collision threat)

### Conclusion
- No collision (risk score 0) or extreme risk (risk score 1) detected.
- Obstacle is longitudinally aligned and approaching, but at a safe distance and TTC.
