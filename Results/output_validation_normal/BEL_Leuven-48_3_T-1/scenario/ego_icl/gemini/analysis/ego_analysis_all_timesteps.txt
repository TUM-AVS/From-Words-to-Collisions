Obstacle Analysis:

Obstacle 30118:
- Trajectory: The obstacle was initially moving away from the ego vehicle longitudinally but has started moving towards the ego vehicle in the most recent timesteps.  Lateral movement shows a slight drift towards the ego vehicle, but remains at 0.00m, indicating perfect lateral alignment.
- At t=0.9s:
    - Longitudinal distance: 15.33m
    - Lateral distance: 0.00m
    - Longitudinal relative velocity: -1.10 m/s (approaching)
    - Lateral relative velocity: 0.18 m/s (slightly approaching)

- TTC Calculation:
    - Longitudinal TTC = 15.33m / 1.10 m/s = 13.94 seconds.
- MDC Calculation: Since the obstacle is directly in front and slightly drifting towards the ego vehicle, the MDC is essentially the lateral distance, which is currently 0.00m.  Given the lateral velocity, the MDC is decreasing. 

- Risk Assessment:
    - Longitudinal Risk: No Risk (5) - TTC > 5.0s.
    - Lateral Risk: Extreme Risk (1) due to 0.00m lateral distance and approaching lateral velocity.

- Overall Risk:  Extreme Risk (1) - Prioritize the higher risk (lower score). The exact lateral alignment, converging longitudinal trajectory, and approaching velocities raise serious concerns. While the longitudinal distance and TTC currently suggest no risk, the persistent lateral alignment over multiple timestamps combined with slight lateral movement towards the ego strongly suggest potential for a collision.


Collision Scenario Determination:

Yes, this is a collision scenario. Obstacle 30118 poses an Extreme Risk (1) due to perfect lateral alignment with approaching longitudinal and lateral velocities, despite currently safe longitudinal TTC values. The consistent exact alignment with slight lateral movement across multiple timesteps suggests a high likelihood of an imminent collision if the ego vehicle's path is not adjusted.
