### Obstacle 30118

#### Trajectory Analysis:

- **At 0.1 seconds:** 
  - Longitudinal distance: 15.68 m
  - Relative longitudinal velocity: 0.74 m/s
  
- **At 0.2 seconds:** 
  - Longitudinal distance: 15.72 m
  - Relative longitudinal velocity: 0.50 m/s
  
- **At 0.3 seconds:**
  - Longitudinal distance: 15.74 m
  - Relative longitudinal velocity: 0.26 m/s
  
- **At 0.4 seconds:** 
  - Longitudinal distance: 15.72 m
  - Relative longitudinal velocity: 0.02 m/s

- **At 0.5 seconds:** 
  - Longitudinal distance: 15.69 m
  - Relative longitudinal velocity: -0.13 m/s
  - Begin motion towards ego vehicle.

- **At 0.6 seconds:** 
  - Longitudinal distance: 15.63 m
  - Relative longitudinal velocity: -0.41 m/s

- **At 0.7 seconds:** 
  - Longitudinal distance: 15.55 m
  - Relative longitudinal velocity: -0.60 m/s

- **At 0.8 seconds:** 
  - Longitudinal distance: 15.45 m
  - Relative longitudinal velocity: -0.81 m/s

- **At 0.9 seconds:** 
  - Longitudinal distance: 15.33 m
  - Relative longitudinal velocity: -1.10 m/s

#### Calculations at the most recent timestep (0.9 seconds):

- **Adjusted Longitudinal Distance:** Assuming vehicles are in exact lateral alignment, the adjusted distance is essentially the same as the relative longitudinal distance, indicating direct alignment.
- **Relative Velocity (longitudinal):** -1.10 m/s indicates the obstacle is approaching the ego vehicle.
  
- **Time-to-Collision (TTC) Longitudinal:**
  - \( \text{TTC} = \frac{15.33 \text{ m}}{1.10 \text{ m/s}} \approx 13.94 \text{ seconds} \)

- **Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC):**
  - The MDC remains primarily based on the adjusted longitudinal, which is presently sufficient (15.33 m).

#### Risk Assessment:

- **TTC:** 13.94 seconds (No Risk based on TTC)
- **MDC:** Greater than 5.0 meters (No Risk based on MDC)
  
Based on these calculations, obstacle 30118 around timestamp 0.9 seconds presents a **No Risk** profile as per the defined metrics.

### Conclusion:

This analysis concludes that with the current trajectory and velocity, Obstacle 30118 does not present an imminent or unavoidable collision scenario with the ego vehicle. The trajectory is observed to be an alignment with stable, increasing safe distances.

#### JSON Summary:

```json
{
  "CollisionObstacle": null,
