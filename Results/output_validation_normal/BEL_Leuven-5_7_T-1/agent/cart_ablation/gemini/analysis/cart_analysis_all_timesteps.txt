Obstacle 30295 is initially located in a different lanelet (853) than the ego vehicle (509). However, at t=0.3s, this obstacle transitions to the ego vehicle's lanelet (509).  The x-positions of the ego and obstacle 30295 are converging, and by t=0.9s, they are only about 13 meters apart and approaching each other.  While not an immediate collision, this represents a rapidly increasing risk given the closing speeds.

There's a possibility of a collision with obstacle 30295 given the current trajectories.
