At t=0.9s, the ego vehicle is at (476.40, -176.37) with a velocity of 4.65 m/s and heading 2.46 rad.  Let's analyze the risk posed by each obstacle:

* **Obstacle 30295:** Located at (489.34, -187.34), velocity 8.72 m/s, heading 2.43 rad. This obstacle is relatively close to the ego vehicle and traveling in a similar direction.  The obstacle's y-coordinate is significantly smaller (more negative) than the ego vehicle's but its x-coordinate is converging towards the ego's.  Given the velocity vectors, a collision is possible within the next few seconds unless either vehicle changes its trajectory or speed. **Risk Score: 2 (High Risk)**
* **Obstacle 30298:** Located at (458.87, -178.53), velocity 6.74 m/s, heading -2.13 rad.  This obstacle is somewhat far from the ego vehicle and traveling in the opposite direction. The difference in y-coordinates is small.  There is no immediate risk of collision. **Risk Score: 5 (Negligible Risk)**
* **Obstacle 30301:** Located at (469.37, -166.10), velocity 7.63 m/s, heading -2.39 rad. This obstacle poses no immediate threat as its y-coordinate is much larger and they are moving away.  **Risk Score: 5 (Negligible Risk)**
* **Obstacle 30304:** Located at (482.85, -154.00), velocity 8.85 m/s, heading -2.42 rad. Similar to Obstacle 30301, the difference in y-coordinates is very high with the trajectories diverging.  **Risk Score: 5 (Negligible Risk)**

Obstacle 30295 presents the highest risk. We need to perform a more precise TTC calculation to determine if evasive action is absolutely necessary.  Assuming constant velocity for both ego and obstacle 30295:

* **Relative velocity (x):** 8.72 - 4.65 = 4.07 m/s  (Obstacle 30295 is catching up)
* **Relative velocity (y):** -187.34 - (-176.37) = -10.97 (They are slowly diverging along y)
* **Relative position (x):** 489.34 - 476.40 = 12.94m
* **Relative position (y):** -187.34 - (-176.37) = -10.97 m

Approximate TTC (longitudinal) = Relative position (x) / Relative velocity (x) = 12.94 / 4.07 â‰ˆ 3.18 seconds

Considering the lateral motion, the constant velocity assumption is showing the vehicles diverging vertically. Thus, a detailed analysis needs to look at turning rate and curvature of trajectories. However, the longitudinal TTC of ~3.18 seconds indicates there is still time to maneuver.
