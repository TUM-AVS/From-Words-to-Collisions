### Analysis:

1. **Obstacle 30295**:  
   - **Position**: At 0.9s, the obstacle is at (489.3402, -187.3402), while the ego is at (476.4035, -176.3654).  
   - **Relative Motion**: The obstacle is ahead of the ego in the same lanelet (509.0). The distance between them is decreasing over time.  
   - **TTC**: The relative velocity is approximately 8.7199 m/s (obstacle) - 4.6543 m/s (ego) = 4.0656 m/s. The distance is ~13.0m, so TTC â‰ˆ 3.2s.  
   - **Risk**: The obstacle is in the same lane and closing in, but the TTC is still manageable. **Risk Score: 3 (Medium Risk)**.  

2. **Obstacle 30298**:  
   - **Position**: At 0.9s, the obstacle is at (458.8689, -178.5295), while the ego is at (476.4035, -176.3654).  
   - **Relative Motion**: The obstacle is behind the ego and moving in the opposite direction (orientation -2.134 vs. ego's 2.457).  
   - **Lateral Distance**: The lateral separation is significant (~2.16m).  
   - **Risk**: No immediate threat due to opposite motion and lateral separation. **Risk Score: 5 (Negligible Risk)**.  

3. **Obstacle 30301**:  
   - **Position**: At 0.9s, the obstacle is at (469.3711, -166.1021), while the ego is at (476.4035, -176.3654).  
   - **Relative Motion**: The obstacle is laterally offset (~10.26m) and moving away from the ego.  
   - **Risk**: No immediate threat due to large lateral distance. **Risk Score: 5 (Negligible Risk)**.  

4. **Obstacle 30304**:  
   - **Position**: At 0.9s, the obstacle is at (482.8466, -153.9987), while the ego is at (476.4035, -176.3654).  
   - **Relative Motion**: The obstacle is far ahead and laterally offset (~22.37m).  
   - **Risk**: No immediate threat due to large distance and lateral separation. **Risk Score: 5 (Negligible Risk)**.
