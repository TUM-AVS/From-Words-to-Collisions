At t=0.9s, the ego vehicle is at (476.40, -176.37) with a velocity of 4.65 m/s. Let's analyze each obstacle:

* **Obstacle 30295:** Located at (489.34, -187.34), in the same lanelet (509) as the ego vehicle.  The obstacle is ahead and to the left of the ego vehicle.  Distance is approximately 19.26m.  The relative velocity indicates the obstacle is closing in on the ego vehicle. Due to being in the same lanelet and the closing velocity, this represents a high risk.  Further calculations for TTC and MDC would refine the analysis, but visual inspection and relative movement suggest elevated risk.

* **Obstacle 30298:**  Located at (458.87, -178.53). This obstacle is significantly to the left and slightly behind the ego vehicle and poses no immediate threat.

* **Obstacle 30301:** Located at (469.37, -166.10).  This obstacle is behind and to the left of the ego vehicle.  The Y-coordinate difference suggests this obstacle might be in an adjacent or merging lane.  Without lanelet map information, it's hard to be definitive, but the current trajectory doesn't appear to directly intersect the ego vehicle's path.

* **Obstacle 30304:** Located at (482.85, -153.99). This obstacle is behind the ego vehicle, with a significant difference in Y-coordinates, indicating it is likely in a different lane. No immediate risk.
