Based on the most recent timestep at 0.9 seconds, let's examine each obstacle relative to the Ego vehicle:

1. **Obstacle 30295**:
   - **Position**: (489.3402, -187.3402)
   - **Relative Position to Ego (476.4035, -176.3654)**:  
     - Longitudinal: |489.3402 - 476.4035| = 12.9367 m
     - Lateral: |-187.3402 - (-176.3654)| = 10.9748 m
   - **Velocity**: 8.7199 m/s, still within the same lanelet as Ego (509.0).
   - **Analysis**: Although in the same lanelet, the longitudinal and lateral clearances are sufficient and velocities are similar. 

2. **Obstacle 30298**:
   - **Position**: (458.8689, -178.5295)
   - **Relative Position to Ego**:
     - Longitudinal: |-458.8689 + 476.4035| = 17.5346 m
     - Lateral: |-178.5295 + 176.3654| = 2.1641 m
   - **Velocity**: 6.7434 m/s, located in a different lanelet (33.0).
   - **Analysis**: Different lanelet ensures a negligible risk of collision, despite moderately close positions.

3. **Obstacle 30301**:
   - **Position**: (469.3711, -166.1021)
   - **Relative Position to Ego**:
     - Longitudinal: |469.3711 - 476.4035| = 7.0324 m
     - Lateral: |-166.1021 + 176.3654| = 10.2633 m
   - **Velocity**: 7.6318 m/s, different lanelet (792.0).
   - **Analysis**: No immediate risk of collision due to lanelet difference, moderate separation.

4. **Obstacle 30304**:
   - **Position**: (482.8466, -153.9987)
   - **Relative Position to Ego**:
     - Longitudinal: |482.8466 - 476.4035| = 6.4431 m
     - Lateral: |-153.9987 + 176.3654| = 22.3667 m
   - **Velocity**: 8.8465 m/s, located in a different lanelet (41.0).
   - **Analysis**: Far lateral separation, different lanelet, low risk of collision.

**Risk Summary**:
- The remaining distance and different lanelets significantly reduce risk in most cases.
- No immediate collision predicted, but Obstacle 30295's proximity warrants attention, although not classified as extreme.
