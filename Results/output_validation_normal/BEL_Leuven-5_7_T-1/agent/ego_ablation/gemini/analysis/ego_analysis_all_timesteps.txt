At t=0.9s, Obstacle 30301 is the highest risk obstacle. It is located at longitudinal 7.43m and lateral -1.90m relative to the ego vehicle, placing it in the Front-right zone.  The longitudinal velocity indicates it is moving towards the ego vehicle (-3.61 m/s) and its lateral velocity suggests it is moving towards the ego vehicle from the right (7.56 m/s). The decreasing longitudinal distance combined with the lateral movement towards the ego vehicle's path raises significant concern. At this rate, Obstacle 30301 will very soon cut into the ego vehicle's path, posing a high risk of collision in the next couple of timesteps. So this is a high risk obstacle.

Obstacle 30304 is also in the Front-right zone at longitudinal 4.64m and lateral -19.79m. While it is longitudinally closer than 30301, its greater lateral distance and lateral velocity vector moving away from the ego vehicle suggest a lower overall risk.  Though categorized as medium risk, the longitudinal velocity towards the ego vehicle warrants close monitoring.

Obstacle 30298 poses negligible risk, being located at longitudinal 7.71m and lateral 11.15m with a lateral velocity moving away from the ego. Obstacle 30295 is moving towards the ego from behind but currently poses no immediate threat.
