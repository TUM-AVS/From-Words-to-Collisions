At t=0.9s, obstacle 30304 is closest to the ego vehicle with a longitudinal distance of 4.64m and a lateral distance of -19.79m.  It's approaching the ego vehicle longitudinally at -3.24 m/s and laterally at 8.73 m/s. While the lateral distance suggests it might pass to the right, the relatively small longitudinal distance and continuous approach warrants attention, placing it in a High-Risk category.

Other obstacles are further away and present lower risk. Obstacle 30301 is also approaching longitudinally and laterally, but its greater longitudinal distance (7.43m) makes it less of an immediate concern than 30304.
