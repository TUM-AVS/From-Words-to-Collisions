### Safety analysis for timestep 0.9s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

It's important to note that calculating accurate TTC values requires relative velocity and acceleration.  Since precise adjusted distances (accounting for vehicle size) are not provided, the distance and TTC calculations will be estimations based on the given real distances.  For a real-world application, you would integrate precise vehicle dimensions and more sophisticated TTC calculations. Also, I'll assume a safety buffer/margin of 1 meter for MDC calculations as a placeholder for proper vehicle size consideration.


### Obstacle Analysis:

**- Obstacle ID: 30295**
- Distance Risk reason: Located behind the ego vehicle at a safe distance.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Approaching from behind, but current velocity and distance suggest sufficient time to react if needed.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

**- Obstacle ID: 30298**
- Distance Risk reason:  Although in the front-left, lateral movement suggests diverging paths, reducing risk.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason:  Closing longitudinally, but the lateral motion adds a safety margin.  Requires monitoring.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3

**- Obstacle ID: 30301**
- Distance Risk reason: In the front-right and moving closer both longitudinally and laterally.
- Distance safety score: 2
- Time Risk reason: The combined longitudinal and lateral movement increases collision risk.
- Time safety score: 2
- Overall Risk score: 2

**- Obstacle ID: 30304**
- Distance Risk reason: Closest obstacle, located in the front-right and moving closer both longitudinally and laterally.
- Distance safety score: 1
- Time Risk reason:  High risk due to proximity and movement towards the ego vehicle.
- Time safety score: 1
- Overall Risk score: 1
