## Obstacle 30295 Analysis:
- **Direction:** Behind
- **Adjusted Distances at 0.9s:** Longitudinal: -12.45m, Lateral: 0.00m
- **Relative Velocity:** Longitudinal: 4.06 m/s, Lateral: -0.21 m/s

### Trajectory Analysis:
- The obstacle is showing an increasing longitudinal distance (from -14.30m at 0.1 seconds to -12.45m at 0.9 seconds), indicating it is closing in on the ego vehicle from behind.
- Relative longitudinal velocity is positive, confirming it is approaching the ego vehicle.

### Calculations:
- **TTC (Longitudinal):** Since it's closing in (-12.45m/4.06 m/s) ≈ 3.07s
- **MDC (Lateral):** Given the exact lateral alignment, if maintained, the MDC matches the longitudinal distance of 12.45m (because vehicles aligned laterally).

### Risk Assessment:
- **Longitudinal Risk:** With a TTC of 3.07s, the risk is Medium (score 3).
- **Overall Risk:** As there's no immediate collision threat or extremely close proximity, the risk score is **3 (Medium Risk).**

## Obstacle 30298 Analysis:
- **Direction:** Front-Left
- **Adjusted Distances at 0.9s:** Longitudinal: 7.71m, Lateral: 11.15m
- **Relative Velocity:** Longitudinal: -5.47 m/s, Lateral: 6.69 m/s

### Trajectory Analysis:
- The obstacle is moving away laterally to the left while closing in longitudinally.
- Longitudinal distance decreasing (from 10.3m at 0.5 seconds to 7.71m at 0.9 seconds).

### Calculations:
- **TTC (Longitudinal):** (7.71m/5.47 m/s) ≈ 1.41s
- **MDC:** With the lateral distance increasing, MDC is determined primarily by longitudinal distance (7.71m).

### Risk Assessment:
- **Longitudinal Risk:** With a TTC of 1.41s, the risk is Medium (score 3).
- **Overall Risk:** Given there's no direct collision imminent, the risk score is **3 (Medium Risk).**

## Obstacle 30301 Analysis:
- **Direction:** Front-Right
- **Adjusted Distances at 0.9s:** Longitudinal: 7.43m, Lateral: -1.90m
- **Relative Velocity:** Longitudinal: -3.61 m/s, Lateral: 7.56 m/s

### Trajectory Analysis:
- The obstacle is approaching longitudinally and slightly closing in laterally from the right.
- Longitudinal and lateral distances are decreasing.

### Calculations:
- **TTC (Longitudinal):** (7.43m/3.61 m/s) ≈ 2.06s
- **MDC (Lateral):** As both distances are decreasing, MDC limited by the smallest distance, 1.90m.

### Risk Assessment:
- **Converging in Both Directions**: Medium risk overall due to both distances reducing but not critically.
- **Overall Risk:** Risk score **3 (Medium Risk).**

## Obstacle 30304 Analysis:
- **Direction:** Front-Right
- **Adjusted Distances at 0.9s:** Longitudinal: 4.64m, Lateral: -19.79m
- **Relative Velocity:** Longitudinal: -3.24 m/s, Lateral: 8.73 m/s

### Trajectory Analysis:
- Approaching from the front-right with a significant lateral spacing.
- Longitudinal distance decreasing, confirming an approach.

### Calculations:
- **TTC (Longitudinal):** (4.64m/3.24 m/s) ≈ 1.43s
- **MDC (Lateral):** Primarily influenced by longitudinal distance (4.64m).

### Risk Assessment:
- **Longitudinal Risk:** With a TTC of 1.43s, risk is Medium.
- **Overall Risk:** Risk score **3 (Medium Risk)** due to rapid closure in one dimension.
