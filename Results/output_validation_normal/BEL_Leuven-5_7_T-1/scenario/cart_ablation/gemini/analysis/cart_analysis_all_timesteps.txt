At t=0.9s, Ego is in lanelet 509.0 at (476.40, -176.37) with a velocity of 4.65 m/s. Obstacle 30295 is also in lanelet 509.0 at (489.34, -187.34) with a velocity of 8.72 m/s.  The y-coordinates suggest a potential lane change or cut-in by obstacle 30295 towards Ego's path. The x coordinates and velocity difference indicate that a collision is possible in the next few timesteps if obstacle 30295 continues its current trajectory. This warrants an "Extreme Risk" assessment.  Other obstacles are further away and do not pose an immediate risk.
