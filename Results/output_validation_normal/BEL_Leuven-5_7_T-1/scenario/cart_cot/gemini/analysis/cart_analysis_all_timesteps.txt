### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 30295.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 30295.0 is in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle and, despite the ego vehicle's deceleration, the obstacle is approaching it from behind. The relative positions over the past timesteps indicate a decreasing distance. Although not immediately colliding, the proximity and closing speed represent a significant risk.
- Distance safety score: 2
- Time Risk reason: The obstacle's velocity is higher than the ego vehicle's and although there's some fluctuation in its acceleration, the overall trend indicates a potential for the distance to close even further. The time to collision is relatively short and requires attention.
- Time safety score: 2
- Overall Risk score: 2

- Obstacle ID: 30298.0
- Distance Risk reason:  This obstacle is in a different lanelet and poses no immediate threat. The distance has remained relatively constant throughout the scenario and the trajectory suggests no intersection with the ego vehicle's path.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: The lateral separation and different trajectories minimize the risk of collision, despite the differing velocities and accelerations.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 30301.0
- Distance Risk reason:  This obstacle is in a different lanelet and poses no immediate threat.  It maintains a safe lateral distance from the ego vehicle throughout the provided timeframe.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Due to the different lanelets and directions of travel, there is no immediate time-related collision risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 30304.0
- Distance Risk reason: This obstacle is in a different lanelet and poses no immediate threat. It maintains a safe lateral distance from the ego vehicle.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: The obstacle's movement, even considering its acceleration history, does not present a time-related risk of collision with the ego vehicle.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5


### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. **Most critical obstacle:** Obstacle 30295.0 is the most critical as it is in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle and approaching it from behind.
2. **Trajectory Analysis:** Over the 10 timesteps, Obstacle 30295.0 consistently follows the ego vehicle. Initially, the distance is somewhat large but decreases progressively.
3. **Relative Motion:** The ego vehicle is decelerating, while Obstacle 30295.0 maintains a slightly higher velocity, leading to the closing distance. Although the obstacle's acceleration fluctuates, it doesn't decelerate enough to mitigate the risk.
4. **Collision Assessment:** No collision has occurred within the first second, but given the current trends, a collision is possible if these behaviors continue.
5. **Reasoning:** The continuous decrease in the distance between the ego vehicle and Obstacle 30295.0, combined with their relative speeds, raises significant concern about a potential rear-end collision in the near future if appropriate action isn't taken.

  "CollisionObstacles": [],
  "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {
    "ObstacleID": "30295.0",

  },
  "ScenarioAnalysis": {
    "IsCollisionScenario": false,
    "Reasoning": "No collision has occurred within the analyzed timeframe. However, Obstacle 30295.0 poses a high risk due to its proximity, same-lane position, higher velocity, and closing distance relative to the ego vehicle. A collision is possible if these trends continue, requiring close monitoring and potential evasive maneuvers."
