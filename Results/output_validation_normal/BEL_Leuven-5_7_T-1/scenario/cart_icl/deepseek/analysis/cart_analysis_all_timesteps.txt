### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep:

### Obstacle Analysis:
1. **Obstacle ID: 30295.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is in the same lanelet (509.0) as the ego vehicle and has been consistently moving towards the ego vehicle over the past timesteps. The distance has decreased from ~13.6m to ~12.9m.
   - **Distance safety score**: 2 (High Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: The relative velocity is decreasing (ego decelerating faster than the obstacle), but the obstacle is still approaching. TTC is ~3.5s based on current relative velocity.
   - **Time safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 2 (High Risk)

2. **Obstacle ID: 30298.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is in a different lanelet (33.0) and moving away from the ego vehicle. Distance has increased from ~19.4m to ~21.6m.
   - **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: The obstacle is moving away with stable velocity. No collision risk.
   - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)

3. **Obstacle ID: 30301.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is in a different lanelet (792.0) and moving away from the ego vehicle. Distance has increased from ~19.5m to ~20.8m.
   - **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: The obstacle is moving away with stable velocity. No collision risk.
   - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)

4. **Obstacle ID: 30304.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is in a different lanelet (41.0) and moving away from the ego vehicle. Distance has increased from ~30.1m to ~30.5m.
   - **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: The obstacle is moving away with stable velocity. No collision risk.
   - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. Only Obstacle 30295.0 is in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle.
2. The distance between ego and 30295.0 is decreasing but still >10m.
3. The ego is decelerating faster than the obstacle, reducing collision risk.
4. No immediate collision risk, but high risk due to proximity and same lanelet.
5. Other obstacles are moving away or in different lanelets.
