Obstacle 30301 shows a high risk of collision. It is approaching the ego vehicle both longitudinally and laterally, with a decreasing distance over time.  At 0.9 seconds, the longitudinal distance is only 7.43m and the lateral distance is -1.90m, meaning a potential collision will occur from the front-right side of the ego vehicle. While the lateral velocity suggests it might be moving away, the decreasing lateral distance and its position in the Front-right indicate an increasing collision risk.

Obstacle 30304 also presents a significant risk. Although further laterally (-19.79 m) than 30301 at 0.9 seconds, it's closing in longitudinally at 4.64 meters and its lateral movement still poses a threat.

Obstacle 30298 is moving away laterally and poses a negligible risk. Obstacle 30295, while approaching from behind, is still at a safe distance.

    "Reasoning": "Obstacle 30301 poses an extreme risk of collision, with rapidly decreasing longitudinal and lateral distances. It's on a near-certain collision path with the ego vehicle from the front-right.  Obstacle 30304, although further out laterally, is also approaching quickly and might pose a collision risk shortly after 30301."
