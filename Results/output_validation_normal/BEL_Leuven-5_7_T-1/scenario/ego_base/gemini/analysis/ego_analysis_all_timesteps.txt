At t=0.9s, Obstacle 30304 is the closest to the ego vehicle, with a longitudinal distance of 4.64m and a lateral distance of -19.79m (front-right). It's approaching the ego longitudinally at -3.24 m/s and laterally at 8.73 m/s.  While Obstacle 30301 is also in the front-right and approaching, it is further away longitudinally (7.43m) and laterally (-1.90m). Obstacle 30298 (front-left) and 30295 (behind) pose less immediate risk due to their distances and relative motions. Although obstacle 30304 is the closest, a collision is not imminent in the next timestep, however, it is getting close, and thus represents an extreme risk.

**Risk Levels and Definitions:**
<Collision (Score: 0)>: Actual collision has occurred or is unavoidable within the next timestep.
<Extreme Risk (Score: 1)>: Immediate collision or very high likelihood of impact. Urgent action is required.
<High Risk (Score: 2)>: Close to collision or highly probable collision path. Needs prompt attention and quick manoeuvring.
<Medium Risk (Score: 3)>: Moderate collision risk but manageable with timely reactions and proper strategies.
<Low Risk (Score: 4)>: Minimal collision risk. The situation is controllable with sufficient time to react.
<Negligible Risk (Score: 5)>: No significant collision risk. Obstacles are either moving away or far enough not to interfere.
