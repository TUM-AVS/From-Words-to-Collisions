### Safety analysis for timestep 0.9 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

**Assumptions and Clarifications:**

* The prompt mentions "adjusted distances" (adjusted_d_long and adjusted_d_lat), but these values are not provided in the scenario context.  Therefore, the analysis will be based on the provided "real distance" (DTClong and DTClat) values.  This might lead to less precise risk assessments.
* TTC will be approximated using distance and relative velocity. Since acceleration data is provided, a more accurate TTC calculation involving constant acceleration could be used if deemed necessary upon seeing actual values.  Since only relative velocities are given, the analysis assumes the ego vehicle is stationary for simplification.
* A general heuristic will be used for risk assessment based on the provided definitions due to the lack of concrete thresholds for TTC and distance in the prompt.

### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 30295**
- Distance Risk reason: Located behind the ego vehicle at a longitudinal distance of -12.45m and a lateral distance of -12.45m. While it is approaching the ego vehicle from behind (longitudinal velocity 4.06 m/s), the lateral movement is negligible (-0.21 m/s).  The negative distances suggest it's slightly offset diagonally behind.
- Distance safety score: 4 (Low Risk -  There's some distance, but the closing velocity needs monitoring)
- Time Risk reason:  TTClong is approximately 3.06 seconds (-12.45m / 4.06 m/s).
- Time safety score: 3 (Medium Risk - The closing speed is moderately high)
- Overall Risk score: 4 (Low Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 30298**
- Distance Risk reason: Situated front-left of the ego vehicle at a longitudinal distance of 7.71m and a lateral distance of 7.71m. Moving towards the ego vehicle longitudinally (-5.47 m/s) but away laterally (6.69 m/s).
- Distance safety score: 3 (Medium Risk - Moderately close and approaching longitudinally.)
- Time Risk reason: TTClong is approximately 1.41 seconds (7.71m / 5.47m/s).  Lateral motion is divergent, decreasing risk.
- Time safety score: 2 (High Risk -  The closing longitudinal speed is high.)
- Overall Risk score: 3 (Medium Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 30301**
- Distance Risk reason:  Located front-right of the ego vehicle at 7.43m longitudinal and 7.43m lateral distance. Approaching both longitudinally (-3.61 m/s) and laterally (7.56 m/s). This lateral movement towards the ego vehicle raises concern.
- Distance safety score: 3 (Medium Risk - Close and approaching.)
- Time Risk reason: TTClong is approximately 2.06 seconds (7.43m / 3.61 m/s). The concerning lateral movement suggests potential future collision even though the longitudinal TTC appears moderate.
- Time safety score: 2 (High Risk due to converging lateral motion)
- Overall Risk score: 2 (High Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 30304**
- Distance Risk reason: Positioned front-right at 4.64m longitudinal and 4.64m lateral distance. Closing in both longitudinally (-3.24 m/s) and laterally (8.73 m/s). The proximity and converging motion represent a significant risk.
- Distance safety score: 2 (High Risk - Very close.)
- Time Risk reason: TTClong is around 1.43 seconds (4.64m / 3.24 m/s). The rapid lateral convergence increases the risk.
- Time safety score: 1 (Extreme Risk due to close proximity and high lateral closing speed.)
- Overall Risk score: 1 (Extreme Risk)


### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
  "CollisionObstacle": null,
  "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {
    "ObstacleID": "30304",
    "OverallRiskScore": "1"
  },
  "IsCollisionScenario": false,
  "Justification": "Obstacle 30304 poses an extreme risk due to its close proximity, converging longitudinal and lateral motion, and high lateral speed. While no immediate collision is predicted at this timestep, the rapid convergence suggests a high probability of collision in the next few timesteps if no evasive action is taken."
