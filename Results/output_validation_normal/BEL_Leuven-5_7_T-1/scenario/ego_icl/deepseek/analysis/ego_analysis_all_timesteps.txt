Let me analyze each obstacle at the most recent timestep (0.9 seconds) and assess collision risks:

1. **Obstacle 30295 (Behind)**
   - Longitudinal distance: -12.45m (behind)
   - Lateral distance: 0.00m (exact alignment)
   - Relative velocity: longitudinal 4.06 m/s (approaching), lateral -0.21 m/s (minimal)
   - Motion: Approaching from behind with exact lateral alignment
   - MDC: Lateral distance is 0.00m but trajectories are parallel (no crossing)
   - TTC: Not applicable since lateral distance isn't closing meaningfully
   - Risk: No immediate collision risk (5)

2. **Obstacle 30298 (Front-left)**
   - Longitudinal distance: 7.71m
   - Lateral distance: 11.15m
   - Relative velocity: longitudinal -5.47 m/s (approaching), lateral 6.69 m/s (moving away)
   - Motion: Approaching longitudinally but moving away laterally
   - MDC: Increasing lateral distance means no crossing path
   - TTC: Not applicable (diverging paths)
   - Risk: No immediate collision risk (5)

3. **Obstacle 30301 (Front-right)**
   - Longitudinal distance: 7.43m
   - Lateral distance: -1.90m
   - Relative velocity: longitudinal -3.61 m/s (approaching), lateral 7.56 m/s (approaching)
   - Motion: Approaching from front-right diagonally
   - MDC: Projected minimum distance is decreasing but still >1m
   - TTC (lateral): 1.90/7.56 = 0.25s (extreme risk)
   - TTC (longitudinal): 7.43/3.61 = 2.06s (medium risk)
   - Risk: Extreme risk (1) due to very low lateral TTC

4. **Obstacle 30304 (Front-right)**
   - Longitudinal distance: 4.64m
   - Lateral distance: -19.79m
   - Relative velocity: longitudinal -3.24 m/s (approaching), lateral 8.73 m/s (approaching)
   - Motion: Approaching from far front-right diagonally
   - MDC: Large lateral distance despite approaching
   - TTC (lateral): 19.79/8.73 = 2.27s (medium risk)
   - TTC (longitudinal): 4.64/3.24 = 1.43s (medium risk)
   - Risk: Medium risk (3)

**Trajectory Analysis:**
- Obstacle 30301 is the critical concern, showing rapid lateral closure (from -7.72m at 0.1s to -1.90m at 0.9s) with high lateral velocity
- The lateral TTC of 0.25s indicates imminent collision risk
- Other obstacles either have diverging paths or sufficient distance

**Conclusion:**
This is a collision scenario due to Obstacle 30301's extreme risk status with TTC < 0.5s in the lateral dimension.

    "CollisionObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": null,
        "OverallRiskScore": null
    },
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "30301",
        "OverallRiskScore": "1"
    },
    "IsCollisionScenario": true,
    "Justification": "Obstacle 30301 has extreme collision risk (TTC 0.25s laterally) with rapidly decreasing distance from the right side of the ego vehicle, making collision imminent without intervention."
