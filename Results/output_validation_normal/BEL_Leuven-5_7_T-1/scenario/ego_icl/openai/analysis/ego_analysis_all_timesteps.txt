**Analysis of the Latest Timestep (0.9 seconds):**

### Obstacle 30295 (Behind):
- **Position:** Longitudinal: -12.45 m, Lateral: 0.00 m
- **Relative Velocity:** Longitudinal: 4.06 m/s (approaching), Lateral: -0.21 m/s (stable)
- **Trajectory:** The obstacle is maintaining longitudinal alignment and moving toward the ego vehicle.
- **Time-to-Collision (TTC):**
  - Longitudinal: 12.45 m / 4.06 m/s = 3.07 seconds
- **Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC):**
  - Alignment implies MDC = 0.00m longitudinally, but the lateral component ensures no immediate collision.
- **Risk Assessment:** Medium Risk (3)
  - TTC between 1.0 and 3.0 seconds and stable lateral distance.

### Obstacle 30298 (Front-left):
- **Position:** Longitudinal: 7.71 m, Lateral: 11.15 m
- **Relative Velocity:** Longitudinal: -5.47 m/s (moving away), Lateral: 6.69 m/s (moving away)
- **Trajectory:** The obstacle is diverging both longitudinally and laterally.
- **Time-to-Collision (TTC):** Not applicable due to positive velocity components indicating diverging path.
- **Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC):**
  - Due to diverging path, projected paths will not intersect.
- **Risk Assessment:** No Risk (5)
  - Diverging paths indicate no reasonable collision path.

### Obstacle 30301 (Front-right):
- **Position:** Longitudinal: 7.43 m, Lateral: -1.90 m
- **Relative Velocity:** Longitudinal: -3.61 m/s (approaching), Lateral: 7.56 m/s (approaching)
- **Trajectory:** The obstacle approaches longitudinally and laterally.
- **Time-to-Collision (TTC):**
  - Longitudinal: 7.43 m / 3.61 m/s = 2.06 seconds
  - Lateral: 1.90 m / 7.56 m/s = 0.25 seconds (approaching)
- **Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC):**
  - Crossing path suggests a low MDC of the lateral component.
- **Risk Assessment:** Extreme Risk (1)
  - Lateral TTC < 0.5 seconds and converging trajectory.

### Obstacle 30304 (Front-right):
- **Position:** Longitudinal: 4.64 m, Lateral: -19.79 m
- **Relative Velocity:** Longitudinal: -3.24 m/s (approaching), Lateral: 8.73 m/s (approaching)
- **Trajectory:** The obstacle is converging longitudinally and laterally.
- **Time-to-Collision (TTC):**
  - Longitudinal: 4.64 m / 3.24 m/s = 1.43 seconds
  - Lateral: 19.79 m / 8.73 m/s = 2.27 seconds
- **Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC):**
  - No immediate intersection as lateral distance significantly exceeds safe margins.
- **Risk Assessment:** Medium Risk (3)
  - Neither TTC nor MDC are below critical values. Paths likely diverging over time.

### Conclusion:
- The collision scenario is primarily indicated by Obstacle 30301, with an Extreme Risk due to critical lateral convergence and low TTC.
- Obstacle 30301 has an extreme risk (score 1) due to rapid convergence in lateral displacement despite its apparent diverging trajectory in the other dimension.

**Scenario Conclusion:** This is identified as a collision scenario due to the extreme risk posed by Obstacle 30301.
