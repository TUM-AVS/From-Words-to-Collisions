Both Ego and Obstacle 30297.0 are in the same lanelet (41.0) and moving in roughly the same direction (similar orientations).  The obstacle is behind the ego vehicle and closing the distance between them over time.  Let's analyze the longitudinal distance:

* **0.1s:** Distance ≈ 11.3 meters
* **0.2s:** Distance ≈ 10.5 meters
* **0.3s:** Distance ≈ 9.8 meters
* **0.4s:** Distance ≈ 9.2 meters
* **0.5s:** Distance ≈ 8.8 meters
* **0.6s:** Distance ≈ 8.5 meters
* **0.7s:** Distance ≈ 8.2 meters
* **0.8s:** Distance ≈ 7.9 meters
* **0.9s:** Distance ≈ 7.7 meters


While the distance is decreasing, the rate of decrease is slowing down as the obstacle is decelerating faster than the ego vehicle. At the current rate, a collision is not imminent in the next few timesteps, but the situation needs to be monitored closely. It currently poses a high risk.
