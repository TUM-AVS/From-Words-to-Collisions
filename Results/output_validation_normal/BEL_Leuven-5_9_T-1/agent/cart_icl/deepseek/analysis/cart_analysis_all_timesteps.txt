### Analysis:

1. **Relative Motion and Trajectory**:
   - Both the ego vehicle (ID: 30298) and the obstacle (ID: 30297) are moving in the same lanelet (41.0) with similar orientations (~-2.4 radians).
   - The obstacle is ahead of the ego vehicle and moving faster (12.4664 m/s vs. 10.8181 m/s at 0.9s). However, the obstacle is decelerating more aggressively (-3.7348 m/s² vs. -1.1928 m/s² for ego).

2. **Time to Collision (TTC)**:
   - At 0.9s:
     - Relative longitudinal position: ~(509.9047 - 498.6205) = 11.2842m (obstacle ahead).
     - Relative longitudinal velocity: (12.4664 - 10.8181) = 1.6483 m/s (closing speed).
     - TTC = 11.2842 / 1.6483 ≈ 6.85s (manageable time to react).

3. **Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC)**:
   - The lateral distance is negligible (same lanelet), but the longitudinal distance is sufficient (~11.28m at 0.9s).
   - The trend shows the distance is decreasing slowly due to the closing speed.

4. **Risk Assessment**:
   - The obstacle is ahead and moving faster, but the closing speed is low, and the TTC is relatively high (~6.85s). The deceleration of both vehicles further reduces the risk.
   - **Overall Risk Score**: 4 (Low Risk) – Minimal risk, sufficient time to react.
