At t=0.9s, the ego vehicle (ID 30298) is at (509.90, -129.98) with a velocity of 10.82 m/s and the obstacle (ID 30297) is at (498.62, -139.99) with a velocity of 12.47 m/s. Both are in the same lane (41).

The obstacle is behind and to the left of the ego vehicle.  Let's approximate TTC using longitudinal and lateral components separately.

**Longitudinal:**
* Relative longitudinal position: 498.62 - 509.90 = -11.28 m (obstacle is behind)
* Relative longitudinal velocity: 12.47 - 10.82 = 1.65 m/s (obstacle is approaching)
* Longitudinal TTC: -11.28 / 1.65 = -6.84 s (negative implies the obstacle is catching up, but the magnitude suggests ample time)

**Lateral:**
* Lateral distance: |-129.98 - (-139.99)| = 10.01 m (significant lateral separation)

Considering both longitudinal and lateral components, along with similar orientations, a collision appears unlikely in the near future. The obstacle is approaching from behind but relatively slowly and with significant lateral separation.  The risk appears low. Using the provided risk levels and incorporating recent time steps to observe the trend, a score of 4 (Low Risk) seems appropriate.
