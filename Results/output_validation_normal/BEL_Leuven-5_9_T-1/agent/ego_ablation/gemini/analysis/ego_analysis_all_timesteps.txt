At t=0.9s, obstacle 30297 is 10.58m ahead of the ego vehicle and moving away longitudinally at 1.65 m/s.  The lateral distance is 0.0m and the lateral velocity is -0.0 m/s indicating the obstacle is directly in front of the ego vehicle or the lateral movement is unknown. Given the increasing longitudinal distance and the positive longitudinal velocity (moving away), the risk of collision is negligible.
