The obstacle is moving away from the ego vehicle with a longitudinal velocity of 1.65 m/s and a lateral velocity of 0.00 m/s. The longitudinal distance is increasing, suggesting no immediate collision risk.  The lateral distance is 0.00m, indicating the obstacle is directly in front of the ego vehicle. While the lateral velocity is also 0.00 m/s at this moment, the situation warrants monitoring for any potential lateral movement in subsequent time steps.  Given the current state, the risk level is considered low.
