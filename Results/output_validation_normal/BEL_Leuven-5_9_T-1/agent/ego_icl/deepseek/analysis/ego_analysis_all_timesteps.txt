### Analysis for Obstacle 30297 (Most Recent Timestep: 0.9 seconds)

#### Position and Motion:
- **Direction**: Front (longitudinally aligned)
- **Adjusted Distances**: 
  - Longitudinal: 10.58 m (increasing over time)
  - Lateral: 0.00 m (exact alignment, no lateral deviation)
- **Relative Velocity**: 
  - Longitudinal: 1.65 m/s (positive, but obstacle is moving away from ego)
  - Lateral: -0.00 m/s (negligible lateral motion)
- **Motion Description**: "Obstacle is moving away longitudinally. Exact lateral alignment or unknown case."

#### Trajectory Analysis:
- Over the timesteps (0.1s to 0.9s), the longitudinal distance increases from 9.35 m to 10.58 m, indicating the obstacle is moving away from the ego vehicle.
- The lateral distance remains 0.00 m, confirming exact alignment in the lateral dimension, but there is no lateral movement toward the ego vehicle.

#### Time-to-Collision (TTC):
- **Longitudinal TTC**: Not applicable (relative velocity is positive, meaning the obstacle is moving away).
- **Lateral TTC**: Not applicable (relative velocity is ~0 m/s, no lateral movement).

#### Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC):
- **Longitudinal MDC**: 10.58 m (increasing, no risk of collision).
- **Lateral MDC**: 0.00 m (exact alignment, but no closing velocity).

#### Risk Assessment:
- The obstacle is moving away longitudinally, and there is no lateral movement toward the ego vehicle. 
- The longitudinal distance is large (10.58 m) and increasing, and the lateral alignment does not pose a risk since there is no closing velocity.
- **Overall Risk**: Negligible (5).

### Final JSON Summary:
```json
{
    "CollisionObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": null,
        "OverallRiskScore": null
    },
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": null,
        "OverallRiskScore": null
    },
    "HighRiskObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": null,
        "OverallRiskScore": null
    }
}
```

### Explanation:
- No collision or extreme/high-risk obstacles are present. The only obstacle (30297) is moving away from the ego vehicle with no closing velocity in any dimension, resulting in negligible risk (score 5). The JSON summary reflects this with null values for collision and high-risk categories.
