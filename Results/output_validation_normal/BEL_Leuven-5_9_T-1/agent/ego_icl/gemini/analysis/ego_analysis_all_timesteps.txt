Obstacle 30297 is in front of the ego vehicle and has been consistently moving away longitudinally over the observed time steps. The lateral distance remains at 0.00m throughout, indicating the obstacle is in the same lane as the ego vehicle.

At the most recent timestep (0.9 seconds), the longitudinal distance is 10.58m and increasing.  The relative longitudinal velocity is 1.65 m/s, which although positive, represents the *difference* in velocities, and since the obstacle is moving away, this suggests the ego vehicle is moving faster. Since the longitudinal distance is increasing, TTC calculation is not relevant in this case. The consistent lateral alignment (0.00m) in this case doesn't present a risk because the longitudinal distance is substantial and increasing.

MDC is primarily determined by the lateral distance in this front/behind scenario. Given the constant 0.0m lateral distance, if the obstacle was approaching rapidly, MDC would be a concern. However, the obstacle is moving away, resulting in an increasing longitudinal distance, further diminishing any collision risk. In this case, the MDC can be approximated as greater than 5.0m due to the direction of travel.

Based on the increasing distance and the direction of movement, the risk level for Obstacle 30297 is negligible.
