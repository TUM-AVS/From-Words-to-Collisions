### Obstacle Analysis

#### Obstacle 30297 Analysis
- **Trajectory Analysis over Timesteps:**
  - At each timestep, the longitudinal distance between the ego vehicle and Obstacle 30297 increases, indicating that the obstacle is moving away from the ego vehicle.
  - The relative longitudinal velocity is consistently positive, indicating that the obstacle's speed is greater than the ego vehicle's speed, causing it to move away.
  - Relative lateral velocity is slightly negative, which is negligible and shows minimal lateral movement.

- **Most Recent Timestep (0.9 seconds):**
  - **Adjusted Longitudinal Distance:** 10.58 m
  - **Adjusted Lateral Distance:** 0.00 m (aligned laterally, but not a collision since the longitudinal distance is large)
  - **Relative Velocity:**
    - Longitudinal: 1.65 m/s (Obstacle is moving away)
    - Lateral: -0.00 m/s (No significant lateral movement)

- **Time-to-Collision (TTC) Calculation:**
  - Since the relative longitudinal velocity is positive, TTC is not applicable as the obstacle is moving away from the ego vehicle.

- **Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC) Calculation:**
  - Longitudinal movement indicates diverging paths; hence MDC > 10.58 m.
  - Lateral alignment presents no risk since the longitudinal component shows diverging paths.

- **Motion Description Verification:**
  - "Obstacle is moving away longitudinally" confirms diverging motion and non-collision trajectory.

- **Risk Assessment:**
  - Despite the lateral alignment, the increasing longitudinal distance and positive relative velocity indicate no risk.
  - Given the calculated parameters and motion direction, the risk level is assessed as 5 (Negligible Risk).
