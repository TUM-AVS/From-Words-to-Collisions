At t=0.9s, Ego is at (509.90, -129.98) and Obstacle 30297.0 is at (498.62, -139.99). Both are in the same lanelet (41.0) and moving in roughly the same direction (similar orientations).  The obstacle is behind the ego and both are decelerating. The distance between them is approximately sqrt((509.90-498.62)^2 + (-129.98 - -139.99)^2) â‰ˆ 15.7 meters.

While the obstacle is behind the ego, the provided data doesn't give us information about the dimensions of the vehicles or lateral movement.  We can see that the velocity difference is decreasing over time, but purely based on longitudinal distance at this single timestep (0.9s), a collision isn't imminent in the next instant.  However, given they are in the same lane and the obstacle is closing in while both decelerate, the risk is significant and merits attention. Therefore, I classify it as high risk (2), not extreme risk (1).

{
    "CollisionObstacles": [],
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null,
    "ScenarioAnalysis": {
        "IsCollisionScenario": false,
        "Reasoning": "Obstacle 30297.0 is behind Ego and closing in within the same lanelet while decelerating, posing a high but not immediate collision risk at t=0.9s. Insufficient information to classify as extreme risk based on distance alone."
    }
}
