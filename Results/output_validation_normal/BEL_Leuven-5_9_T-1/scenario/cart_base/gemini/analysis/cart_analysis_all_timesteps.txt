At t=0.9s, Ego is at (509.90, -129.98) and Obstacle 30297.0 is at (498.62, -139.99). Both are in the same lanelet (41.0).  The obstacle is behind the ego, and both are moving in roughly the same direction (similar orientations). While the distance is closing slightly (obstacle decelerating less aggressively than ego), the current separation and velocity difference don't suggest an immediate collision. Based on the provided data, the trajectory doesn't indicate an immediate or unavoidable collision within the next immediate timestep.
