### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 30297.0
- Distance Risk reason: The obstacle is in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle and the distance between them is decreasing over time. At the last timestep, the distance is approximately 11.3 meters. While not immediately dangerous, the continuous approach poses a medium risk. The orientations suggest both are moving in roughly the same direction.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: Both vehicles are moving in the same general direction with the obstacle having a slightly higher velocity initially. However, both vehicles are decelerating. The obstacle's deceleration is more significant than the ego vehicle, reducing the TTC.  This dynamic situation requires careful monitoring.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. **Most critical obstacle:** Obstacle 30297.0 is the only obstacle identified in the scenario and it shares the same lanelet as the ego vehicle.

2. **Trajectory analysis:** Over the 10 timesteps, both the ego vehicle and the obstacle are moving in the same general direction and decelerating. The obstacle consistently remains ahead of the ego vehicle, and the distance between them decreases over time.

3. **Relative position, velocity, and acceleration:** The relative positions show the obstacle is ahead of the ego vehicle in the same lane.  Initially, the obstacle has a slightly higher velocity, but it decelerates more rapidly than the ego vehicle.

4. **Collision determination:** At the last timestep (0.9 seconds), a collision has not occurred. While the distance is decreasing, it is not imminent within the timeframe of the provided data.  The relative velocities and decelerations suggest a potential for collision if these trends continue, but it is not certain based on the limited data.

5. **Reasoning:** Although the obstacle's deceleration is more substantial, the current separation and the limited timeframe of the data don't definitively confirm a collision. Continued monitoring of relative motion and further data points are needed to confirm if a collision will indeed occur. The decreasing distance and the dynamics of deceleration raise concern, indicating a medium risk level.
