### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:
- **Obstacle ID**: 30297.0  
  - **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is in the same lanelet (41.0) as the ego vehicle and has been consistently moving closer over the previous timesteps. The distance between the ego and the obstacle has decreased from ~11.3m at 0.1s to ~9.3m at 0.9s.  
  - **Distance safety score**: 2 (High Risk)  
  - **Time Risk reason**: The relative velocity (ego: 10.8181 m/s, obstacle: 12.4664 m/s) suggests the obstacle is approaching the ego vehicle. The time to collision (TTC) is approximately 9.3m / (12.4664 - 10.8181) â‰ˆ 5.6s, which is decreasing but not yet critical.  
  - **Time safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk)  
  - **Overall Risk score**: 2 (High Risk)  

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. **Lanelet Proximity**: Both ego and obstacle are in lanelet 41.0, indicating shared space.  
2. **Trajectory**: The obstacle is consistently moving toward the ego vehicle, with decreasing distance over time.  
3. **Relative Velocity**: The obstacle is faster than the ego, but the ego is decelerating more aggressively.  
4. **TTC**: The TTC is currently ~5.6s, which is not immediate but warrants attention.  
5. **Trend**: The risk is increasing due to decreasing distance and converging velocities.
