### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 30294.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is in a different lanelet and far away.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason:  No imminent threat based on current trajectories.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 30295.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is in a different lanelet and far away.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: No imminent threat based on current trajectories.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 30296.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is in the same lanelet but relatively far based on the provided data.  Monitoring is needed.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: The obstacle and ego vehicle are moving in the same direction, and the obstacle is decelerating more aggressively than the ego vehicle, slightly decreasing the risk over time.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- Obstacle ID: 30297.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is in the same lanelet and closer than 30296.0. Requires attention.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: Obstacle is moving in the same direction but decelerating more aggressively than the ego vehicle, suggesting the risk might decrease soon.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3

- Obstacle ID: 30299.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is in a different lanelet and far away.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: No imminent threat based on current trajectories.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5


### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
No immediate collision detected at this timestep. Obstacles 30296.0 and 30297.0 pose a potential risk in the future as they share the same lanelet with the ego vehicle and are relatively close. However, they appear to be decelerating, which might mitigate the risk. Continuous monitoring is crucial, especially for these two obstacles.  No obstacles have a risk score of 0 or 1.
