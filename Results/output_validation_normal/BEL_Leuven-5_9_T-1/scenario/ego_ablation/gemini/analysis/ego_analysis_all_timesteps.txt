The obstacle 30297 is moving away from the ego vehicle longitudinally and is positioned directly in front (laterally aligned).  The longitudinal distance is increasing over time, and the relative longitudinal velocity is positive, indicating separation. While the lateral velocity is negligible, the increasing longitudinal distance suggests no immediate collision risk.
