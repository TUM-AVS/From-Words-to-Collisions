### Obstacle-by-Obstacle Analysis

**Obstacle ID: 30297**  
**Most Recent Timestep (0.9s):**  
- **Direction:** Front  
- **Adjusted Distances:** Longitudinal 10.58 m, Lateral 0.00 m  
- **Relative Velocity:** Longitudinal 1.65 m/s (moving away), Lateral -0.00 m/s (stable alignment)  
- **Relative Acceleration:** Longitudinal 1.90 m/s², Lateral 1.69 m/s²  
- **Motion Description:** Obstacle is moving away longitudinally. Exact lateral alignment or unknown case.  

#### Trajectory Analysis (0.1s to 0.9s):  
- **Longitudinal Distance Trend:** Increasing (9.35m → 10.58m)  
- **Lateral Distance Trend:** Stable (0.00m)  
- **Relative Velocity Trend:**  
  - Longitudinal: Positive but decreasing (2.17 m/s → 1.65 m/s)  
  - Lateral: Very small fluctuations around 0.00 m/s  
- **Conclusion:** The obstacle is steadily moving away from the ego vehicle with no lateral deviation.  

#### Time-to-Collision (TTC) Calculation:  
- **Longitudinal TTC:** Not applicable (relative velocity is positive, meaning the obstacle is moving away).  
- **Lateral TTC:** Not applicable (relative velocity is ~0.00 m/s, no convergence).  
- **Effective TTC:** Infinite (no collision course).  

#### Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC):  
- Since the obstacle is directly ahead (lateral = 0.00m) but moving away longitudinally, the MDC is effectively the current longitudinal distance (10.58m).  

#### Risk Assessment:  
- **MDC = 10.58m** → **No Risk (5)**  
- **TTC = Infinite** → **No Risk (5)**  
- **Overall Risk Score:** **5 (No Risk)**  

### Conclusion  
- The obstacle is moving away from the ego vehicle with no signs of convergence.  
- No collision or extreme risk is detected.
