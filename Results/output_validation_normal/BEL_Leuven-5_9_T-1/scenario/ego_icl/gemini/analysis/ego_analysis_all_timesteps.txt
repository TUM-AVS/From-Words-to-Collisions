Obstacle 30297 Analysis:

Trajectory Analysis:  Over the observed time period (0.0s to 0.9s), Obstacle 30297 consistently remains in front of the ego vehicle.  While laterally aligned (0.00m lateral distance), the longitudinal distance *increases* from 9.35m to 10.58m, indicating the obstacle is moving away from the ego vehicle.

TTC Calculation: Since the obstacle is moving away longitudinally, a positive relative longitudinal velocity indicates divergence, and TTC is not applicable in the longitudinal direction as a collision is not possible given the current trajectories.  Lateral velocity is negligible and moving away from the ego vehicle.

MDC Calculation: The minimum distance to collision (MDC) is based on the longitudinal distance, which is increasing. At the last timestep (0.9s), the MDC is 10.58m.

Risk Assessment:
* Longitudinal: With increasing distance and positive relative velocity, there is no longitudinal risk.  Risk score: 5 (No Risk)
* Lateral:  Although laterally aligned, the lateral velocity shows the obstacle slightly moving away from the ego vehicle, so there's no lateral risk.  Risk score: 5 (No Risk)

Overall Risk Score for Obstacle 30297: 5 (No Risk)

Collision Scenario Determination:
Since no obstacle has a risk score of 0 (Collision) or 1 (Extreme Risk), this is NOT a collision scenario.
