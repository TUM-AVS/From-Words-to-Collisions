### Obstacle Analysis

#### Obstacle 30297
- **Position Over Time:**
  - At 0.1 seconds: Longitudinal 9.35m, Lateral 0.00m
  - At 0.9 seconds (Most Recent): Longitudinal 10.58m, Lateral 0.00m

- **Relative Motion:**
  - Relative Velocity (Most Recent): Longitudinal 1.65 m/s, Lateral 0.00 m/s
  - Relative Acceleration (Most Recent): Longitudinal 1.90 m/s², Lateral 1.69 m/s²
  - Motion: Obstacle is moving away longitudinally. Exact lateral alignment or unknown case.

- **Trajectory Analysis:**
  - Over the time steps, the longitudinal distance consistently increases, indicating the obstacle is moving away from the ego vehicle.
  - The lateral distance remains zero, highlighting the precise alignment with the ego vehicle's path but moving away longitudinally.

- **Time-to-Collision (TTC) Calculation:**
  - Longitudinal: Since the obstacle is moving away, TTC is not applicable for collision prediction in this scenario.

- **Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC) Calculation:**
  - Evaluate primarily the longitudinal distance, as the lateral alignment is exact, but paths are diverging with increasing distance.
  - Longitudinal Distance at 0.9 seconds is 10.58m.

- **Risk Assessment:**
  - **TTC:** Not applicable due to diverging paths.
  - **MDC Score:** Based on the longitudinal distance of > 5.0m, the risk is categorized as "No Risk."
  - **Overall Risk:** Considering the motion description and increasing longitudinal distance, the obstacle has a **No Risk** score of 5.

### Conclusion
- The assessment of Obstacle 30297 shows that it is moving away from the ego vehicle with an increasing longitudinal distance, indicating no imminent risk of collision.
- This scenario is not a collision scenario, as there is no obstacle with a risk score of 0 or 1.
