Obstacle 30261 is consistently in the same lane (304) as the ego vehicle and exhibits concerning behavior.  Its velocity decreases significantly over the observed time steps (from 7.3003 at t=0.1s to 2.9388 at t=0.9s) while the ego vehicle maintains a relatively constant velocity.  The continuous decrease in velocity and proximity in the same lane suggests a high risk of collision. The x-positions also show a closing distance, starting at ~9m apart and converging towards ~1m apart. The y-position delta is also very small.

Obstacle 30268 is also in the same lane (304) as the ego vehicle. Although the velocity initially decreased, it is now increasing, suggesting a possibility of catching up to the Ego if the Ego also breaks. Its position relative to the ego vehicle raises concerns. While not as imminent as 30261, it warrants attention as it could transition into a more severe risk category if the velocities converge further or the ego slows.

Obstacle 30271 is in a different lane (942), therefore, a collision risk is deemed minimal despite its decreasing velocity.
