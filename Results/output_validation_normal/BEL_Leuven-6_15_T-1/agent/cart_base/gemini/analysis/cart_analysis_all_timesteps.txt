Obstacle 30261 is in the same lane as the ego vehicle and initially about 9 meters ahead and closing.  Its velocity is initially similar to the ego vehicle but decelerates rapidly over the provided timesteps. This strong deceleration suggests a potential hazard and increases the risk of a rear-end collision if the ego vehicle doesn't react appropriately. Obstacle 30268 is also in the same lane as the ego vehicle, but further away and moving slower than both the ego vehicle and obstacle 30261. Obstacle 30271 is in a different lane and doesn't represent a significant risk. Although 30261 decelerates significantly, it does not pose a direct collision threat in the observed timeframe. Therefore, the risk assessment is primarily focused on Obstacle 30261, classifying it as a high risk due to the closing distance and relative speeds.
