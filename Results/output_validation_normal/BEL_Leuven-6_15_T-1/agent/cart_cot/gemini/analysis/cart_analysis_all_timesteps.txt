At t=0.9s, the ego vehicle at (83.3575, 216.0872) is moving with a velocity of 7.4517 and acceleration of -0.4777. We need to analyze its interaction with three obstacles:

* **Obstacle 30259:** Located at (96.4987, 189.5383) with velocity 6.7337 and acceleration -0.2055, in lanelet 261. This obstacle is far from the ego vehicle and moving away, posing no immediate risk.

* **Obstacle 30261:** Located at (91.6325, 206.4185) with velocity 2.9388 and acceleration -5.4549 in lanelet 304. Although in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle, its decreasing velocity indicates a likely attempt to avoid collision, and the lateral distance is significant. However, cautious observation is required. 

* **Obstacle 30268:** Located at (73.5247, 231.3319) with velocity 5.8789 and acceleration 0.6994 in lanelet 304. This obstacle is behind and to the side of the ego vehicle, with a lateral offset and higher y-coordinate. An appropriate safety distance appears maintained, reducing immediate risk.


**Calculations (at t=0.9s):**

Due to the nature of the provided data (discrete time steps) and the non-constant velocities/accelerations, precise TTC and MDC calculation requires intricate numerical methods.  We provide estimations assuming momentary constant velocity and acceleration for the sake of demonstrating the methodology.

**Obstacle 30261 (Approximation):**

* **Lateral Distance:** Roughly 10 meters (using positions at t=0.9s)
* **Longitudinal Distance:** Roughly 8 meters (using positions at t=0.9s)
* **Relative Velocity:**  Ego's velocity - Obstacle velocity = ~4.5 m/s (longitudinal component would be smaller)

Given the large distance, both lateral and longitudinal, and despite being in the same lanelet, the current risk is considered relatively low.  However, continuous monitoring is necessary.

**Obstacle 30268 (Approximation):**
* **Lateral Distance:** ~15 meters (using positions at t=0.9s)
* **Longitudinal Distance:** ~ 15 meters (using positions at t=0.9s)
* **Relative Velocity:** Ego's velocity and Obstacle's Velocity are moving relatively same speed and almost same direction. 

This obstacle poses very low risk due to the large distance and almost similar trajectories.


**Predictions:**
Given the current dynamics, none of the obstacles are predicted to result in a collision in the immediate future.  Obstacle 30261, though in the same lane, shows a significant deceleration which suggests active collision avoidance behavior.
