### Analysis:

1. **Obstacle 30261**:
   - **Position**: (91.6325, 206.4185) at 0.9s
   - **Relative Position to Ego**: Ego is at (83.3575, 216.0872), so obstacle is ahead and to the left.
   - **Velocity**: 2.9388 m/s (decelerating rapidly at -5.4549 m/s²).
   - **TTC**: Not directly approaching ego (lateral distance is significant, and longitudinal distance is increasing due to ego's motion).
   - **Risk**: Low (4) - Obstacle is decelerating and not on a collision course.

2. **Obstacle 30268**:
   - **Position**: (73.5247, 231.3319) at 0.9s
   - **Relative Position to Ego**: Ego is at (83.3575, 216.0872), so obstacle is behind and to the right.
   - **Velocity**: 5.8789 m/s (slightly increasing at 0.6994 m/s²).
   - **TTC**: Not directly approaching ego (lateral distance is significant, and longitudinal distance is increasing due to ego's motion).
   - **Risk**: Low (4) - Obstacle is not on a collision course.

3. **Obstacle 30271** (last seen at 0.6s):
   - **Position**: (66.6419, 243.5250) at 0.6s
   - **Relative Position to Ego**: Ego was at (81.9887, 217.8880), so obstacle is far behind and to the right.
   - **Velocity**: 5.3043 m/s (nearly constant).
   - **TTC**: Not a threat (large lateral and longitudinal distance).
   - **Risk**: Negligible (5) - No significant risk.

4. **Obstacle 30259** (appears at 0.9s):
   - **Position**: (96.4987, 189.5383) at 0.9s
   - **Relative Position to Ego**: Ego is at (83.3575, 216.0872), so obstacle is ahead and far to the left (different lanelet).
   - **Velocity**: 6.7337 m/s (decelerating slightly at -0.2055 m/s²).
   - **TTC**: Not a threat (large lateral and longitudinal distance).
   - **Risk**: Negligible (5) - No significant risk.

### Summary:
- No obstacles pose an immediate or extreme risk to the ego vehicle.
- All obstacles are either decelerating or maintaining a safe distance.
