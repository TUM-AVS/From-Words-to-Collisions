At t=0.9s, obstacle 30261 is positioned directly in front of the ego vehicle, at a longitudinal distance of 8.20 meters and with a closing relative velocity of -4.52 m/s. This represents a very high risk of collision, potentially within the next 2 seconds if the relative velocity remains constant or increases.

Obstacle 30259, while further away at 24.54 meters, is approaching at a high relative longitudinal velocity of -7.98 m/s and poses a medium term risk. Its lateral motion and relative acceleration also need monitoring.

Obstacle 30268 is moving away from the ego vehicle and does not pose any risk.
