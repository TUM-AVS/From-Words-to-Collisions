### Safety analysis for timestep 0.9s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 30259**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is located 24.54m longitudinally and 24.54m laterally in the front-right of the ego vehicle.  While approaching (-7.98 m/s longitudinal velocity), the lateral movement is away from the ego vehicle (-6.71 m/s).
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: The high longitudinal distance and the fact that the obstacle is moving away laterally suggest a low risk of collision.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 30261**
- Distance Risk reason: Located longitudinally at 8.20m in front and 8.20m laterally. It's approaching the ego vehicle with a longitudinal velocity of -4.52 m/s. Lateral velocity is minimal (0.23 m/s).  The continuous approach longitudinally represents a higher risk.
- Distance safety score: 2
- Time Risk reason:  Given the decreasing longitudinal distance and relative velocity, the TTC is low, increasing the risk of collision.
- Time safety score: 2
- Overall Risk score: 2

- **Obstacle ID: 30268**
- Distance Risk reason: This obstacle is behind the ego vehicle at -13.57m longitudinally and -13.57m laterally. It is moving away at -1.72 m/s longitudinally and -1.31 m/s laterally.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason:  The obstacle's movement away from the ego vehicle significantly reduces the risk of collision.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5
