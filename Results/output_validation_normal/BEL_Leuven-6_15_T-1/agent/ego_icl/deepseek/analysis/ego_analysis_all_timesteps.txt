### Obstacle-by-Obstacle Analysis:

#### Obstacle 30259 (Front-right of ego car)
- **Adjusted Distance**: Longitudinal 24.54 m, Lateral -4.19 m  
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal -7.98 m/s (approaching), Lateral -6.71 m/s (moving away to the right)  
- **Motion**: Obstacle is driving toward the ego car longitudinally but moving away laterally to the right.  
- **Trajectory Analysis**:  
  - Longitudinal distance is decreasing rapidly (high closing speed).  
  - Lateral distance is increasing (moving away).  
- **TTC (Longitudinal)**:  
  - TTC = 24.54 / 7.98 ≈ 3.07 seconds (Medium Risk)  
- **MDC (Lateral)**:  
  - Since lateral distance is increasing, MDC is not applicable for collision risk.  
- **Overall Risk**: Medium Risk (3) due to longitudinal approach.  

#### Obstacle 30261 (Front of ego car)
- **Adjusted Distance**: Longitudinal 8.20 m, Lateral 0.00 m  
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal -4.52 m/s (approaching), Lateral 0.23 m/s (minimal lateral movement)  
- **Motion**: Obstacle is driving toward the ego car longitudinally with exact lateral alignment.  
- **Trajectory Analysis**:  
  - Longitudinal distance is decreasing at an accelerating rate (increasing relative speed).  
  - Lateral alignment is stable (no significant lateral movement).  
- **TTC (Longitudinal)**:  
  - TTC = 8.20 / 4.52 ≈ 1.81 seconds (Medium Risk)  
- **MDC (Lateral)**:  
  - Since lateral distance is 0.00 m but not closing, MDC is not a collision risk.  
- **Overall Risk**: Medium Risk (3) due to longitudinal approach.  

#### Obstacle 30268 (Behind of ego car)
- **Adjusted Distance**: Longitudinal -13.57 m, Lateral 0.00 m  
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal -1.72 m/s (moving away), Lateral -1.31 m/s (moving away to the left)  
- **Motion**: Obstacle is moving away longitudinally and laterally.  
- **Trajectory Analysis**:  
  - Both longitudinal and lateral distances are increasing (no collision risk).  
- **TTC**: Not applicable (diverging paths).  
- **MDC**: Not applicable (diverging paths).  
- **Overall Risk**: Negligible Risk (5).  

#### Obstacle 30271 (Rear-left of ego car)
- **Adjusted Distance**: Longitudinal -25.00 m, Lateral 1.04 m (from previous timestep, not in most recent)  
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal -2.39 m/s (moving away), Lateral 1.07 m/s (moving away to the left)  
- **Motion**: Obstacle is moving away both longitudinally and laterally.  
- **Trajectory Analysis**:  
  - Distances are increasing (no collision risk).  
- **TTC**: Not applicable (diverging paths).  
- **MDC**: Not applicable (diverging paths).  
- **Overall Risk**: Negligible Risk (5).

}
```

### Key Findings:
- No obstacles pose a collision (0), extreme risk (1), or high risk (2).  
- Obstacles 30259 and 30261 are at Medium Risk (3) due to longitudinal approach but with sufficient time to react.  
- Obstacles 30268 and 30271 are moving away and pose no risk.  

### Final Note:
The ego vehicle should monitor Obstacle 30261 (front) closely due to its stable lateral alignment and decreasing longitudinal distance, though current risk remains manageable.
