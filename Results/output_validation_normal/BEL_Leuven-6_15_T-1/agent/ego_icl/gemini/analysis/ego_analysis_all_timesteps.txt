Obstacle 30259 (Front-right):
- Trajectory: This obstacle appears at the last timestep. It is located diagonally front-right of the ego vehicle.
- Longitudinal Analysis: Distance is 24.54m, relative velocity is -7.98 m/s (moving away).  TTC is not applicable due to separating trajectories. No longitudinal risk.
- Lateral Analysis: Distance is -4.19m (to the right), relative velocity is -6.71 m/s (moving away). TTC is not applicable due to separating trajectories. No lateral risk.
- Overall Risk: Negligible (5)

Obstacle 30261 (Front):
- Trajectory: Consistently in front and laterally aligned with the ego vehicle across all timesteps. Longitudinal distance decreasing.
- Longitudinal Analysis: Distance 8.20m, relative velocity -4.52 m/s (closing). TTC = 8.20 / 4.52 = 1.81s. This indicates a High risk (2).
- Lateral Analysis: Lateral distance is 0.00m (perfect alignment). However, the lateral relative velocity is 0.23 m/s (slightly diverging), decreasing the immediate lateral collision risk.  Since the motion description states the obstacle is driving toward the ego car longitudinally, we focus on the longitudinal risk.
- Overall Risk: High (2) due to the decreasing longitudinal distance and TTC.

Obstacle 30268 (Behind):
- Trajectory: Consistently behind and laterally aligned with the ego vehicle. Longitudinal distance increasing (moving further behind).
- Longitudinal Analysis: Distance -13.57m, relative velocity -1.72 m/s (moving away). TTC is not applicable due to separating trajectories. No longitudinal risk.
- Lateral Analysis: Lateral distance 0.00m (perfect alignment), relative velocity -1.31 m/s (moving away). TTC is not applicable due to separating trajectories. No lateral risk.
- Overall Risk: Negligible (5)
