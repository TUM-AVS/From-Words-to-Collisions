### Analysis of Obstacles at the Most Recent Timestep (0.9 seconds):

#### Obstacle 30259 (Front-Right)
- **Trajectory Analysis:**
  - The obstacle is in the front-right position and moving toward the ego vehicle.
  - Longitudinal distance: 24.54 m
  - Lateral distance: -4.19 m
  - Relative velocity: longitudinal -7.98 m/s, lateral -6.71 m/s
  - According to previous analysis, it has been moving both longitudinally and laterally away from the ego vehicle.

- **Calculation:**
  - **TTC (Longitudinal)** = 24.54 m / 7.98 m/s ≈ 3.07 seconds
  - **TTC (Lateral)** = 4.19 m / 6.71 m/s ≈ 0.62 seconds
  - **MDC** estimated primarily based on the potential crossing trajectory, focusing on lateral alignment ultimately leading to a tight front-right pass.

- **Risk Level:**
  - The quicker lateral arrival with a TTC less than 1 second indicates a **High Risk (2)**, though the longitudinal clearance is more comfortable.

#### Obstacle 30261 (Front)
- **Trajectory Analysis:**
  - The obstacle is directly in front of the ego vehicle and closing in.
  - Longitudinal distance: 8.20 m
  - Lateral distance: 0.00 m
  - Relative velocity: longitudinal -4.52 m/s, lateral 0.23 m/s
  - The longitudinal distance is decreasing, indicating a closing trajectory.

- **Calculation:**
  - **TTC (Longitudinal)** = 8.20 m / 4.52 m/s ≈ 1.81 seconds
  - **MDC (Longitudinal alignment)**, hence primarily focused on the longitudinal dimension in same-lane alignment.
  
- **Risk Level:**
  - With a TTC between 1 and 3 seconds, the risk is **Medium Risk (3)**.

#### Obstacle 30268 (Behind)
- **Trajectory Analysis:**
  - The obstacle is behind and moving away from the ego vehicle.
  - Longitudinal distance: -13.57 m
  - Lateral distance: 0.00 m
  - Relative velocity: longitudinal -1.72 m/s, indicating moving away and alignment.

- **Calculation:**
  - TTC is not applicable as the obstacle is moving away, indicating no active collision risk.
  - **MDC** itself is moot given the movement is diverging.

- **Risk Level:**
  - With divergent paths, the risk is **Negligible Risk (5)**.
