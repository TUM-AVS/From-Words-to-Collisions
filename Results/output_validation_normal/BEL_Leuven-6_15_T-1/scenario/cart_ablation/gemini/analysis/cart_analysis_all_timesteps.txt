At t=0.9s, Ego is in lanelet 304.0 at (83.3575, 216.0872) with velocity 7.4517 m/s.

Obstacle 30259.0 is in a different lanelet (261.0) and poses no immediate risk despite its relatively high velocity.

Obstacle 30261.0 is in the same lanelet as Ego (304.0) at (91.6325, 206.4185). While it's somewhat close longitudinally, its lateral position and rapidly decreasing velocity (2.9388 m/s and decelerating at -5.4549 m/sÂ²) suggest it's not an immediate collision risk.  It's worth monitoring in subsequent timesteps though.

Obstacle 30268.0 is in the same lanelet as Ego at (73.5247, 231.3319). It's further behind Ego than 30261.0 and moving slower.  It's not a high risk.
