At t=0.9s, Ego is in lanelet 304.0 at (83.3575, 216.0872) with a velocity of 7.4517 m/s.

Obstacle 30259.0 is in a different lanelet (261.0) and poses no immediate risk despite its proximity.

Obstacle 30261.0 is in the same lanelet as Ego at (91.6325, 206.4185) with a velocity of 2.9388 m/s. While it's ahead of Ego, the y-coordinate suggests it might be slightly offset and its velocity is significantly lower than Ego's.  Based on the provided data, it's hard to definitively determine an extreme risk of collision in the very next timestep without more precise lanelet information and obstacle dimensions.  However, the decreasing velocity trend of 30261.0 suggests it may be braking heavily, making an eventual collision possible if Ego does not react. We classify this as a high risk (2) and not an extreme risk (1) due to this uncertainty.

Obstacle 30268.0 is in the same lanelet as Ego at (73.5247, 231.3319).  The y-coordinate difference suggests it's likely in a different lane within the same lanelet.  No immediate collision risk.

Therefore, no obstacle presents an extreme or collision risk in the next immediate timestep based on the provided data.
