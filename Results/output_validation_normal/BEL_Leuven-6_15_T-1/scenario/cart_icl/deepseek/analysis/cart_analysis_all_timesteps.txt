### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep (0.9 seconds):

### Obstacle Analysis:
1. **Obstacle ID: 30259.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Located in lanelet 261.0, far from ego's lanelet (304.0). Position (96.4987, 189.5383) is distant and moving away.
   - **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: Velocity (6.7337) is similar to ego but trajectory diverges. No convergence.
   - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 5

2. **Obstacle ID: 30261.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Same lanelet (304.0), but position (91.6325, 206.4185) is ahead and decelerating rapidly (accel: -5.4549). Distance increasing.
   - **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: Relative velocity decreasing (ego: 7.4517, obstacle: 2.9388). TTC increasing.
   - **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 4

3. **Obstacle ID: 30268.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Same lanelet (304.0), position (73.5247, 231.3319) is behind ego but closing distance slowly (velocity: 5.8789 vs ego's 7.4517).
   - **Distance safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: Small positive relative velocity (ego faster). Minimal convergence.
   - **Time safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 3

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. No obstacles are on a direct collision course (all trajectories diverge or have safe separation).
2. Obstacle 30261.0 is decelerating rapidly, increasing separation.
3. Obstacle 30268.0 is behind and slower, posing minimal risk.
4. No abrupt direction changes observed in any obstacle's history.
5. Ego's deceleration (-0.4777) further reduces risks.
