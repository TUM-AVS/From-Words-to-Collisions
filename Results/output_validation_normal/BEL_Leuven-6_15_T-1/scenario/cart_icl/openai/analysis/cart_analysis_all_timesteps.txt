### Obstacle Analysis for the Most Recent Timestep:

**Ego Vehicle Current Position**: `(83.3575, 216.0872)`, **Orientation**: `-0.9141933259512524`, **Velocity**: `7.4517`

1. **Obstacle 30261.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Approaching ego as both are in lanelet 304.0, longitudinal position is reducing.
   - **Distance safety score**: 3
   - **Time Risk reason**: Steadily decelerating, indicating possibility of stopping before collisionâ€”velocity reduced significantly.
   - **Time safety score**: 3
   - **Overall Risk score**: 3

2. **Obstacle 30268.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Close proximity in lanelet 304.0, trajectory approaching ego.
   - **Distance safety score**: 2
   - **Time Risk reason**: Consistent speed with minor acceleration changes poses moderate risk due to direction.
   - **Time safety score**: 2
   - **Overall Risk score**: 2

3. **Obstacle 30257.0 to 30274.0 (Other obstacles not sharing lanelet with ego)**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Not in collision path, distinct lanelet or path well isolated from ego.
   - **Distance safety score**: 4
   - **Time Risk reason**: Consistent or diverging velocities and trajectories minimize immediate collision risk.
   - **Time safety score**: 4
   - **Overall Risk score**: 4

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
- Assess all obstacles relative to ego; prioritize those sharing the same lanelet.
- Of those:
  - Obstacle 30261.0 in same lanelet, posing a moderate risk due to reducing distance and deceleration behavior.
  - Obstacle 30268.0 potentially problematic due to proximity and converging paths.
- Given moderate risk scores and lack of extreme or collision scoring, no urgent collision scenario is present.
