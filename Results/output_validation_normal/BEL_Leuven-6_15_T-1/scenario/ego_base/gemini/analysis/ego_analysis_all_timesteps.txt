At t=0.9s, Obstacle 30261 is in front of the ego vehicle, at a longitudinal distance of 8.20m and closing at -4.52 m/s.  While the lateral distance is 0.00 m, the lateral velocity is 0.23 m/s and positive lateral acceleration suggests a potential lateral movement away from the ego, slightly reducing the immediate risk. However, the closing longitudinal velocity and distance combined with the relatively high deceleration (-3.37 m/sÂ²) warrants classifying this obstacle as a high risk.

Obstacle 30259 is approaching the ego at -7.98m/s longitudinally and moving away laterally at -6.71 m/s to the right, from an initial distance of 24.54m longitudinally and -4.19 m laterally. While the longitudinal speed is high, the distance and the fact it's moving away laterally makes it medium risk. Obstacle 30268 is behind the ego and moving away, posing negligible risk.


**Risk Levels and Definitions:**
<Collision (Score: 0)>: Actual collision has occurred or is unavoidable within the next timestep.
<Extreme Risk (Score: 1)>: Immediate collision or very high likelihood of impact. Urgent action is required.
<High Risk (Score: 2)>: Close to collision or highly probable collision path. Needs prompt attention and quick manoeuvring.
<Medium Risk (Score: 3)>: Moderate collision risk but manageable with timely reactions and proper strategies.
<Low Risk (Score: 4)>: Minimal collision risk. The situation is controllable with sufficient time to react.
<Negligible Risk (Score: 5)>: No significant collision risk. Obstacles are either moving away or far enough not to interfere.
