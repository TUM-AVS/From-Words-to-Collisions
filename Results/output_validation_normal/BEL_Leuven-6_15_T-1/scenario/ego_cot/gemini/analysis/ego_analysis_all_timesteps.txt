### Safety analysis for timestep 0.9 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

**- Obstacle ID: 30259**
- Distance Risk reason:  Obstacle 30259 is located 24.54m in front and to the right of the ego vehicle. While the distance is significant, the high closing velocity (-7.98 m/s longitudinal, -6.71 m/s lateral) raises concern. This obstacle needs further observation.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Without vehicle dimensions, precise TTC calculation is impossible. However, the high closing velocity and moderately large distance suggest a TTC that might be cause for concern in the near future. More data points are needed to assess the actual risk accurately.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3

**- Obstacle ID: 30261**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 30261 poses the most immediate risk. It is only 8.20m in front of the ego vehicle and moving closer longitudinally at -4.52 m/s. The lateral movement (0.23 m/s) seems minimal and the "Exact lateral alignment or unknown case" description raises the likelihood of a direct collision.
- Distance safety score: 2
- Time Risk reason: The combination of decreasing longitudinal distance and negative longitudinal velocity indicates a high risk of imminent collision. Without vehicle sizes, an exact TTC cannot be calculated, but it is estimated to be very low.
- Time safety score: 1
- Overall Risk score: 1

**- Obstacle ID: 30268**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 30268 is behind the ego vehicle (-13.57m) and moving further away (-1.72 m/s longitudinally).  It poses no immediate risk.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: The negative longitudinal velocity and increasing distance indicate no collision risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5



### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
  "CollisionObstacle": null,
  "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {
    "ObstacleID": "30261",
    "OverallRiskScore": "1"
  },
  "IsCollisionScenario": false,
  "Justification": "Obstacle 30261 has an Overall Risk Score of 1, signifying an extreme risk of collision due to its close proximity, closing velocity and being directly in front of the ego vehicle.  While a collision is not guaranteed, the risk is high enough to warrant immediate evasive action. No obstacle has an Overall Risk Score of 0 indicating immediate collision."
