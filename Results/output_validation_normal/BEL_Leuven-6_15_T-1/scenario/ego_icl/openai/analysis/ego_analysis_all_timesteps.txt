Here's a detailed collision risk analysis based on the most recent timestep provided:

### Analysis of Each Obstacle

**Obstacle 30259:**
- **Position:** Front-right of ego vehicle
- **Adjusted Distances:** Longitudinal = 24.54 m, Lateral = -4.19 m
- **Relative Velocity:** Longitudinal = -7.98 m/s, Lateral = -6.71 m/s
- **MDC:** For diagonal positions, consider both longitudinal and lateral velocities. Since MDC is the minimum distance when projected paths intersect, I'll assume minimum proximity is lateral distance here (4.19 m).
- **TTC:** Longitudinal TTC = 24.54 m / 7.98 m/s ≈ 3.07 s (approaching longitudinally)
- **Risk Assessment:** 
  - MDC > 3.0 m
  - Longitudinal TTC < 5.0 s
- **Risk Score:** 4 (Low Risk)
- **Conclusion:** Not an immediate collision threat, requires monitoring.

**Obstacle 30261:**
- **Position:** Front of ego vehicle
- **Adjusted Distances:** Longitudinal = 8.20 m, Lateral = 0.00 m
- **Relative Velocity:** Longitudinal = -4.52 m/s, Lateral = 0.23 m/s
- **MDC:** Essentially zero in lateral direction due to alignment, but relevant is longitudinal movement (8.20 m).
- **TTC:** Longitudinal TTC = 8.20 m / 4.52 m/s ≈ 1.81 s
- **Acceleration Context:** Consistent negative longitudinal acceleration indicates increasing risk, trajectory is converging longitudinally.
- **Risk Assessment:**
  - MDC > 1.0 m but < 3.0 m - High converging speed
  - Longitudinal TTC < 3.0 s
- **Risk Score:** 3 (Medium Risk)
- **Conclusion:** Potential risk exists, cautious monitoring required.

**Obstacle 30268:**
- **Position:** Behind of ego vehicle
- **Adjusted Distances:** Longitudinal = -13.57 m, Lateral = 0.00 m
- **Relative Velocity:** Longitudinal = -1.72 m/s, Lateral = -1.31 m/s
- **MDC:** Longitudinal distance remains the focus with potential impact; lateral alignment but divergence increases MDC.
- **TTC:** Considerable backward movement (velocity and trajectory), though effectively diverging.
- **Risk Assessment:**
  - MDC > 5.0 m
- **Risk Score:** 5 (No Risk)
- **Conclusion:** Trajectories diverge, not a threat.

### Trajectory Analysis Across Timesteps
- **Obstacle 30261:** This obstacle shows the most converging trend with accelerating longitudinal approach, requiring adjustment in real-time to avoid future collision.
- **Obstacle 30259 and 30268:** Generally diverging, offering more relaxed observation trends; however, 30259 is showing concerning approach but lateral trajectory offsets risk.

### Conclusion
- **Collision or Extreme Risk Scenario:** No obstacle currently scores a 0. Obstacle 30261, with a medium level of concern, needs monitoring, but the present conditions do not confirm an immediate collision scenario.
