Obstacle 30269 is consistently in the same lanelet (304.0) as the ego vehicle and exhibits erratic acceleration changes.  Initially, its acceleration increases, then sharply decreases to a negative value before increasing again. While not immediately colliding, this unpredictable behavior poses a high risk, especially given the relatively close proximity within the same lanelet.  Other obstacles are either in different lanelets or maintain a safe distance.  The closest obstacle in the same lanelet, 30261, is also moving at a similar speed and  maintaining a safe distance, thus representing a lower risk than 30269.
