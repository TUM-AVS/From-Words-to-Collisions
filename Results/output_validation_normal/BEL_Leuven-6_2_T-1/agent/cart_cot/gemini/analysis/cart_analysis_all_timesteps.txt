At t=0.9s, the ego vehicle (ID 30265.0) is at (89.7152, 208.4665) with a velocity of 7.8991 m/s and heading -0.8578 radians.  We will analyze the risk posed by each obstacle at this timestep, considering their trajectories.

* **Obstacle 30259.0:** Located in lanelet 921.0 at (82.1792, 181.4679), moving with velocity 8.8611 m/s and heading -2.5799 radians. This obstacle is geographically separated from the ego vehicle and poses no immediate threat.  Given its trajectory and lanelet, a collision is highly unlikely.  Risk Score: 5 (Negligible Risk)

* **Obstacle 30261.0:** Located in lanelet 950.0 at (100.0438, 196.7597), moving with velocity 7.701 m/s and heading -1.0181 radians. While in a different lanelet, the proximity in the y-coordinate and the x-coordinate ahead of the ego warrants attention. This obstacle needs further observation in subsequent timesteps to assess its future trajectory more accurately.  Risk Score: 4 (Low risk).

* **Obstacle 30262.0:** Located in lanelet 219.0 at (117.6861, 198.1101), moving with velocity 9.2741 m/s and heading 0.6713 radians. The large difference in x-coordinate and opposite heading suggests this obstacle is moving away from the ego vehicle and does not present a risk.  Risk Score: 5 (Negligible Risk)

* **Obstacle 30269.0:** Located in lanelet 304.0 (same as ego) at (80.005, 220.6578) with velocity 7.8351 m/s and heading -0.9549 radians. This obstacle is behind the ego vehicle but significantly to its left within the same lane.  The y-coordinate separation is significant enough to avoid immediate collision, but continued monitoring is needed.  Risk Score: 3 (Medium Risk)

Given the current positions and trajectories, no obstacle presents an immediate collision risk. However, obstacle 30269.0 requires attention due to its proximity and shared lanelet with the ego vehicle, making a future lane change by either vehicle a potential area for conflict.
