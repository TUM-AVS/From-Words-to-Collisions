### Analysis:

1. **Obstacle 30261 (ID: 30261)**:
   - **Position**: (100.0438, 196.7597) at 0.9s.
   - **Relative Motion**: Moving in the same lanelet (304.0) as the ego vehicle but is ahead and to the right. The lateral distance is significant (~11.7m), and the longitudinal distance is ~8.3m ahead. The relative velocity is minimal (ego: 7.8991 m/s, obstacle: 7.701 m/s).
   - **TTC**: Not immediately critical due to the lateral separation and similar speeds.
   - **Risk**: **Low (4)**.

2. **Obstacle 30269 (ID: 30269)**:
   - **Position**: (80.005, 220.6578) at 0.9s.
   - **Relative Motion**: Located behind and to the left of the ego vehicle in the same lanelet (304.0). The lateral distance is ~12.2m, and the longitudinal distance is ~9.7m behind. The obstacle is accelerating (7.8351 m/s vs. ego's 7.8991 m/s).
   - **TTC**: Not critical due to the lateral separation and similar speeds.
   - **Risk**: **Low (4)**.

3. **Obstacle 30259 (ID: 30259)**:
   - **Position**: (82.1792, 181.4679) at 0.9s.
   - **Relative Motion**: Located in a different lanelet (921.0) and is moving away from the ego vehicle. The lateral distance is ~27m, and the longitudinal distance is ~7.5m behind.
   - **TTC**: No immediate risk due to the large lateral separation and divergent paths.
   - **Risk**: **Negligible (5)**.

4. **Obstacle 30262 (ID: 30262)**:
   - **Position**: (117.6861, 198.1101) at 0.9s.
   - **Relative Motion**: Located in a different lanelet (219.0) and is far ahead (~28m longitudinally) and to the right (~10.5m laterally). The obstacle is moving away from the ego vehicle.
   - **TTC**: No immediate risk due to the large separation and divergent paths.
   - **Risk**: **Negligible (5)**.

### Summary:
- No obstacles pose an immediate collision or extreme risk to the ego vehicle.
- All obstacles are either in different lanelets or have sufficient lateral separation to avoid collision.
