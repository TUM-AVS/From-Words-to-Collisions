At t=0.9s, the ego vehicle (ID 30265) is located at (89.7152, 208.4665) with a velocity of 7.8991 m/s and an orientation of -0.8578 radians.  Let's analyze the risk posed by each obstacle:

* **Obstacle 30259:** Located in lanelet 921, significantly to the left and slightly behind the ego vehicle.  Its trajectory suggests it is moving roughly parallel to the ego vehicle but not posing an immediate threat. The lateral distance is substantial, and the longitudinal velocity difference is minimal.  Risk: **Negligible (5)**

* **Obstacle 30261:** Located in lanelet 950. While its Y-coordinate (196.7597) puts it behind the ego vehicle, its X-coordinate (100.0438) suggests a potential lane change or cut-in maneuver by this obstacle. Given the closing longitudinal distance and potential lateral movement into the ego vehicle's path, this warrants close monitoring. Risk: **Medium (3)**

* **Obstacle 30262:** Located in lanelet 219 with coordinates (117.6861, 198.1101), placing it significantly to the right and slightly behind the ego vehicle. With a velocity of 9.2741 m/s, it is moving faster than the ego vehicle. While the current lateral separation suggests no immediate danger, the speed difference and different lanelets warrant attention. Risk: **Low (4)**

* **Obstacle 30269:** In the same lanelet (304) as the ego vehicle, but significantly behind and to the left. Its trajectory shows no immediate sign of cutting in or approaching the ego's path. Risk: **Negligible (5)**
