At t=0.9s, Obstacle 30259 is moving towards the ego vehicle longitudinally while moving away laterally. It poses no immediate threat. Obstacle 30261 is almost directly in front of the ego vehicle and moving slowly towards it longitudinally, presenting a possible risk. Obstacle 30262 is approaching the ego vehicle longitudinally but moving away laterally, so it is not a high risk. Obstacle 30269 is behind the ego vehicle and moving away, not a risk.

Focusing on the most concerning obstacle, 30261, its longitudinal distance is decreasing but at a slow rate, and its lateral velocity suggests it might not be perfectly aligned with the ego vehicle's path. While the current risk is not extreme, its position directly ahead requires monitoring and warrants a medium risk level.
