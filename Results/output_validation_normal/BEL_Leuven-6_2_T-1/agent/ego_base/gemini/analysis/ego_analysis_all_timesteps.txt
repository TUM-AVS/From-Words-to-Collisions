At t=0.9s, obstacle 30259 is at a longitudinal distance of 10.98m and approaching the ego vehicle at -9.23 m/s.  Laterally, it is moving away from the ego vehicle. It represents a potential risk due to its proximity and approach speed but not high or extreme.

Obstacle 30261 is at a longitudinal distance of 11.10m and approaching slowly at -0.30 m/s. It is moving laterally at -1.23 m/s.  This obstacle doesn't present an immediate high risk.

Obstacle 30262 is at a longitudinal distance of 21.62m and approaching at -7.51 m/s.  Laterally, it is moving away from the ego car. Its larger longitudinal distance reduces the immediate risk.

Obstacle 30269 is behind the ego vehicle at -11.07m and moving away at -0.10 m/s longitudinally. Laterally, it is moving at -0.76 m/s. This obstacle poses no immediate risk.

Since none of the obstacles present an immediate collision risk or are extremely close with high closing speeds, there are no high-risk obstacles in this timestep.
