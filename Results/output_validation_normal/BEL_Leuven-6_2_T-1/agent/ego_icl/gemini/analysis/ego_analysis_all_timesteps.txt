Obstacle 30259 (Front-Right):
- Trajectory: Consistently moving to the front-right and away from the ego vehicle both longitudinally and laterally.
- Longitudinal distance: Increasing, indicating decreasing longitudinal risk.
- Lateral distance: Increasing, indicating decreasing lateral risk.
- At 0.9s, longitudinal distance is 10.98m and lateral distance is -21.75m.  Relative longitudinal velocity is -9.23 m/s and lateral velocity is -8.76 m/s (moving away).
- TTC: Not applicable as the obstacle is moving away.
- MDC: > 5m.
- Risk: 5 (Negligible Risk)

Obstacle 30261 (Front):
- Trajectory: The obstacle has maintained a 0 lateral distance to the ego vehicle and has been slowly approaching longitudinally.
- Longitudinal distance: Decreasing slowly across timesteps.
- Lateral distance: Remains at 0.00m, indicating continued longitudinal alignment.
- At 0.9s, the longitudinal distance is 11.10m, and relative longitudinal velocity is -0.30 m/s, lateral velocity -1.23m/s.
- TTC (longitudinal): 11.10m / 0.30 m/s ≈ 37s.
- MDC:  Since it's directly in front, MDC is primarily based on longitudinal distance, which is > 5m.
- Risk: 5 (Negligible Risk)

Obstacle 30262 (Front-Left):
- Trajectory: This obstacle appears at 0.9s for the first time. It's positioned diagonally to the front-left of the ego vehicle.
- At 0.9s, longitudinal distance is 21.62m and lateral distance is 12.77m. Relative longitudinal velocity is -7.51 m/s (approaching) and lateral velocity is 9.27m/s (moving away).
- TTC (longitudinal): 21.62m / 7.51 m/s ≈ 2.9s
- MDC: > 5m since both longitudinal and lateral distance are relatively large and lateral distance is increasing
- Risk: 4 (Low Risk)

Obstacle 30269 (Behind):
- Trajectory: Initially slightly behind, then moves longitudinally away from the ego vehicle.
- Longitudinal distance: Initially decreasing slightly, then increasing from timestep 0.3s and afterwards.
- Lateral distance: Remains at 0.00m, indicating continued longitudinal alignment.
- At 0.9s, the longitudinal distance is -11.07m, and relative longitudinal velocity is -0.10 m/s (moving away), lateral velocity -0.76 m/s.
- TTC: Not applicable since the obstacle is moving away longitudinally.
- MDC: > 5m (safe distance behind).
- Risk: 5 (Negligible Risk)
