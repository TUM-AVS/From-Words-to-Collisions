### Obstacle Analysis at Most Recent Timestep (0.9 seconds)

#### Obstacle 30259 (Front-Right)
- **Trajectory Analysis**: 
  - Positioned at longitudinal 10.98m, lateral -21.75m.
  - Relative velocity: longitudinal -9.23 m/s, lateral -8.76 m/s.
  - Moving toward the ego vehicle longitudinally, moving away laterally to the right.
- **TTC Calculation**:
  - Longitudinal: |10.98 m| / |9.23 m/s| ≈ 1.19s
- **MDC Calculation**:
  - Longitudinal and lateral trajectories do not intersect tightly (lateral distancing).
- **Risk Assessment**:
  - Longitudinal distance and trajectory predict potential collision in approximately 1.19 seconds.
  - **Risk Level**: Medium Risk (3)

#### Obstacle 30261 (Front)
- **Trajectory Analysis**: 
  - Positioned at longitudinal 11.10m, lateral 0.00m.
  - Relative velocity: longitudinal -0.30 m/s, lateral -1.23 m/s.
  - Driving directly toward the ego car longitudinally.
- **TTC Calculation**:
  - Longitudinal: |11.10 m| / |0.30 m/s| ≈ 37.00s
- **MDC Calculation**:
  - Exact lateral alignment but stable long distance. Minimal closing speed.
- **Risk Assessment**:
  - Low closing velocity suggests a distant, low-risk trajectory.
  - **Risk Level**: Low Risk (4)

#### Obstacle 30262 (Front-Left)
- **Trajectory Analysis**:
  - Positioned at longitudinal 21.62m, lateral 12.77m.
  - Relative velocity: longitudinal -7.51 m/s, lateral 9.27 m/s.
  - Approaching longitudinally while moving away laterally.
- **TTC Calculation**:
  - Longitudinal: |21.62 m| / |7.51 m/s| ≈ 2.88s
- **MDC Calculation**:
  - Trajectory shows diverging lateral movement, reducing risk.
- **Risk Assessment**:
  - Increasing lateral distance suggests a manageable risk of collision.
  - **Risk Level**: Medium Risk (3)

#### Obstacle 30269 (Behind)
- **Trajectory Analysis**:
  - Positioned at longitudinal -11.07m, lateral 0.00m.
  - Relative velocity: longitudinal -0.10 m/s, lateral -0.76 m/s.
  - Moving away longitudinally, exact lateral alignment.
- **TTC Calculation**:
  - Longitudinal movement diverging, negative relative velocity.
- **MDC Calculation**:
  - Consistent distance and diverging trajectory suggest minimal collision threat.
- **Risk Assessment**:
  - Negative longitudinal velocity with increasing distance, very low risk.
  - **Risk Level**: Negligible Risk (5)

The analysis concludes with Obstacle 30259 showing a Medium Risk due to its longitudinal approach outweighing its lateral distancing. Obstacle 30261 maintains a lower risk profile due to slow closing speed. Obstacle 30262 is Medium Risk as the longitudinal approach may connect despite lateral distancing, while Obstacle 30269 is assessed as not posing a significant risk due to its diverging trajectory.
