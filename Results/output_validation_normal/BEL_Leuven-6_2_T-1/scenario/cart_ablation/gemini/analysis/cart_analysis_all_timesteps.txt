At t=0.9s, Ego is in lanelet 304.0 at (89.7152, 208.4665).

* Obstacle 30259.0: Located in lanelet 921.0 at (82.1792, 181.4679).  While the lanelets differ, the obstacle's past trajectory shows movement towards the ego vehicle's lanelet.  The distance is moderately close and requires further monitoring but isn't immediately dangerous at this timestep.

* Obstacle 30261.0: Located in lanelet 950.0 at (100.0438, 196.7597).  Again, different lanelets, but the obstacle's trajectory and proximity warrant attention. Further investigation is required to deem it extremely risky.

* Obstacle 30262.0: Located in lanelet 219.0 at (117.6861, 198.1101). Different lanelet and far enough away to not pose an immediate threat.

* Obstacle 30269.0: Located in the same lanelet 304.0 at (80.005, 220.6578). Although in the same lanelet, the obstacle is behind the ego vehicle and moving in the same general direction. This presents a lower risk at this timestep.

Based on the provided data, no obstacle presents a collision or extreme risk at t=0.9s.
