At t=0.9s, Ego (30265.0) is in lanelet 304.0 at (89.7152, 208.4665).  Let's analyze the obstacles:

* **Obstacle 30259.0:** Located in lanelet 921.0 at (82.1792, 181.4679).  While the y-coordinate suggests some lateral separation, the obstacle has been consistently moving closer to the ego vehicle's y-coordinate over the previous timesteps. This combined with the relatively close x-coordinate suggests a potential lane change maneuver by the obstacle might lead to a collision risk. This requires further monitoring but does not constitute an extreme or collision risk at this moment.

* **Obstacle 30261.0:** Located in lanelet 950.0 at (100.0438, 196.7597). Its x-coordinate indicates it is ahead of the ego vehicle and potentially in a different lane based on lanelet information. The difference in y-coordinates and lanelets suggests no immediate risk.

* **Obstacle 30262.0:**  Located in lanelet 219.0 at (117.6861, 198.1101).  Its x-coordinate indicates it is significantly ahead of the ego vehicle and in a different lane. No immediate risk.

* **Obstacle 30269.0:** Located in lanelet 304.0 at (80.005, 220.6578). Although it's in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle, its x-coordinate places it behind the ego vehicle.  The differing y-coordinate and the historical trajectory suggest no immediate collision risk.
