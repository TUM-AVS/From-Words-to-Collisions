### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep (0.9 seconds):

### Obstacle Analysis:
1. **Obstacle ID: 30259.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Located in lanelet 921.0, moving away from ego (lanelet 304.0). Distance is increasing over time (from 88.2878 to 82.1792 in X-coordinate).
   - **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: Velocity is higher than ego but moving away. No convergence in trajectories.
   - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 5

2. **Obstacle ID: 30261.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Initially in same lanelet (304.0) but moved to lanelet 950.0 by 0.8s. X-coordinate increasing (96.1669 to 100.0438), moving away from ego.
   - **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: Velocity similar to ego but diverging trajectory.
   - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 5

3. **Obstacle ID: 30262.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: New obstacle at 0.9s, located in lanelet 219.0 (X=117.6861), far from ego (X=89.7152).
   - **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: High velocity but moving in opposite direction (orientation 0.6713 vs ego's -0.8578).
   - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 5

4. **Obstacle ID: 30269.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Same lanelet (304.0), but X-coordinate diverging (76.4421 to 80.005) while ego moves forward (85.1611 to 89.7152). Lateral distance remains safe.
   - **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: Velocity similar to ego with minor fluctuations. No dangerous convergence.
   - **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 4

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. No obstacles are on a collision course with ego at 0.9s.
2. All obstacles are either in different lanelets or moving away from ego.
3. Closest obstacle (30269.0) is diverging in X-coordinate and poses only low risk.
4. No sudden acceleration/deceleration patterns indicate imminent danger.
