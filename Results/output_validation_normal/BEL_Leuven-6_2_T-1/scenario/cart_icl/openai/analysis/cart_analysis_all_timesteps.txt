### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
Throughout the analyzed timesteps, no immediate or imminent collision patterns are recognized with the ego vehicle. The obstacles exhibiting common lanelets maintain non-threatening trajectories, ensuring sufficient separations. While a small subset of obstacles do show shared paths, their movement dynamics have been adequately consistent and secure in avoiding collision with the ego vehicle.
