At t=0.9s, obstacle 30259 is in the front-right, approaching the ego car longitudinally while moving laterally to the right. Obstacle 30261 is in front, driving towards the ego car longitudinally but its lateral movement is unclear. Obstacle 30262 is in the front-left, approaching longitudinally while laterally moving left. Obstacle 30269 is behind, moving away longitudinally and slightly to the left relative to the ego car.  None of the obstacles pose an immediate collision risk in the next timestep based on current information.

**Risk Levels and Definitions:**
<Collision (Score: 0)>: Actual collision has occurred or is unavoidable within the next timestep.
<Extreme Risk (Score: 1)>: Immediate collision or very high likelihood of impact. Urgent action is required.
<High Risk (Score: 2)>: Close to collision or highly probable collision path. Needs prompt attention and quick manoeuvring.
<Medium Risk (Score: 3)>: Moderate collision risk but manageable with timely reactions and proper strategies.
<Low Risk (Score: 4)>: Minimal collision risk. The situation is controllable with sufficient time to react.
<Negligible Risk (Score: 5)>: No significant collision risk. Obstacles are either moving away or far enough not to interfere.
