### Safety analysis for timestep 0.9 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 30259**
- Distance Risk reason: Located at 10.98m longitudinally and 10.98m laterally in the front-right of the ego vehicle.  While approaching, the lateral movement suggests divergence, reducing immediate risk.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason:  Closing longitudinally at -9.23 m/s.  Requires monitoring but doesn't pose an immediate threat given the lateral movement. More information about ego vehicle's intended path is needed for a more accurate assessment.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3

- **Obstacle ID: 30261**
- Distance Risk reason:  At 11.10m longitudinally and 11.10m laterally in front. The proximity represents a potential hazard.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: Approaching at -0.30 m/s longitudinally.  The slow closing speed and the lateral movement suggest the obstacle might clear the path but requires careful attention.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3

- **Obstacle ID: 30262**
- Distance Risk reason: Located 21.62m longitudinally and 21.62m laterally in the front-left.  The distance and lateral movement indicate low risk.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason:  Closing longitudinally at -7.51 m/s while moving laterally at 9.27 m/s. The lateral motion indicates it's unlikely to collide unless there's a significant change in trajectories.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4


- **Obstacle ID: 30269**
- Distance Risk reason: Located 11.07m behind and slightly to the left.  The position behind the ego car implies less risk, but its lateral movement merits continued observation.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason:  Moving away longitudinally at -0.10 m/s while moving laterally towards at -0.76 m/s. The slight closing lateral motion while moving away longitudinally poses low risk.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4


### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
  "CollisionObstacle": null,
  "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null,
  "IsCollisionScenario": false,
  "Justification": "No obstacle poses an immediate collision risk (Overall Risk Score 0 or 1). All obstacles have sufficient distance or are moving in a direction that doesn't indicate an imminent collision."
}
