### Obstacle-by-Obstacle Analysis:

#### Obstacle 30259 (Front-right)
- **Position and Motion Analysis**:
  - Latest Position: Longitudinal 10.98 m, Lateral -21.75 m
  - Velocity: Longitudinal -9.23 m/s, Lateral -8.76 m/s
  - Motion: Vehicle is moving towards the ego vehicle both longitudinally and laterally (right).
  
- **Trajectory Forecast**:
  - Observable trend: Since the obstacle is moving towards the ego vehicle both longitudinally and laterally, it’s getting closer in terms of diagonal proximity.
  - Longitudinally, it's closing significantly at high speed. Laterally, it is moving further right but still maintains a level of convergence due to high closing speeds.

- **MDC and TTC Calculations**:
  - Given the speeds and positions, this obstacle doesn't appear to have extreme risks due to being far enough laterally. 
  - Estimated MDC: Considering continued trajectory with adjusted lateral and longitudinal velocities, the distance doesn’t suggest imminent collision (MDC is high enough given lateral distance is increasing strategically).
  - Estimated TTC: Won't be reaching approximate collision proximities in the next couple of seconds (> 5 s due to constantly increasing lateral offset).

- **Risk Assessment**: 
  - By velocity and distance consideration: *Risk Level 4 (Low Risk)* given lateral escape route and greater initial separation.

#### Obstacle 30261 (Front)
- **Position and Motion Analysis**:
  - Latest Position: Longitudinal 11.10 m, Lateral 0.00 m
  - Velocity: Longitudinal -0.30 m/s, Lateral -1.23 m/s
  - Motion: Exact lateral alignment with the ego vehicle and approaching longitudinally but very slowly.  
  
- **Trajectory Forecast**:
  - Mostly maintaining a steady and close proximity longitudinally. Any future reduction needs careful consideration.
  - Slow velocities indicate minor changes across short future periods.  
  
- **MDC and TTC Calculations**:
  - MDC: Measures very closely to front alignment.
  - TTC: Due to slow approach, this does produce concerning values if unchecked longitudinally approaching, but still not imminently critical (< 1 m/s approach).
  
- **Risk Assessment**:
  - Proximity and slow relative velocity yield *Risk Level 3 (Medium Risk)*. Adjustments in ego speed could alter that without intervention.

#### Obstacle 30262 (Front-left)
- **Position and Motion Analysis**:
  - Latest Position: Longitudinal 21.62 m, Lateral 12.77 m
  - Velocity: Longitudinal -7.51 m/s, Lateral 9.27 m/s
  - Motion: Approaching longitudinally but diverging laterally to the left.
  
- **Trajectory Forecast**:
  - As driving away laterally the intersection path is misaligned, indicating independence in collision risk.
  
- **MDC and TTC Calculations**:
  - MDC: distances here are noticeably larger due to that lateral shift increasing massively.
  - TTC: No closeness towards ego because of the lateral divergence.

- **Risk Assessment**:
  - Risks from this obstacle are not concerning: *Risk Level 5 (No Risk)* because it diverges laterally.

#### Obstacle 30269 (Behind)
- **Position and Motion Analysis**:
  - Latest Position: Longitudinal -11.07 m, Lateral 0.00 m
  - Velocity: Longitudinal -0.10 m/s, Lateral -0.76 m/s
  - Motion: Vehicle is moving away; exact lateral alignment.
  
- **Trajectory Forecast**:
  - Very little motion changes across successive timestamps particularly longitudinal (moving mostly away).
  
- **MDC and TTC Calculations**:
  - Longitudinal velocity indicates retreat instead of approach.
  - No known trajectory leads to intersection, supporting safe longer-term distance.

- **Risk Assessment**:
  - Risk due to rearward motion is lowly: *Risk Level 5 (No Risk)*.

### Conclusion
None of the obstacles have an immediate threat-based trajectory that aligns with collision scenarios at this instantaneous analysis. No concerningly low potential MDC or TTC was observed in verification.
