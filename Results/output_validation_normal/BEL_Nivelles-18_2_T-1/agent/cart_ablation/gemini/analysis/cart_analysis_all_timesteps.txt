Obstacle 319 is in the same lane as the ego vehicle (lanelet 10988) from timestep 0.6 seconds onwards.  Its lateral position is consistently close to the ego vehicle.  While not colliding in the given timeframe, the consistent proximity and relatively small difference in velocity suggest a high risk of collision if their trajectories continue unchanged. Obstacle 355 is also laterally close to the ego vehicle.  It is initially in a different lanelet (10981), and at t=0.9s it transitions to lanelet 10124 which indicates a lane change trajectory that might intersect the ego vehicle's path. Since it has a much higher velocity than the ego vehicle, it poses a high collision risk. Obstacle 33, while laterally distanced from the ego vehicle and in a different lanelet, shows substantial acceleration, and itâ€™s worthwhile to monitor its future behavior.
