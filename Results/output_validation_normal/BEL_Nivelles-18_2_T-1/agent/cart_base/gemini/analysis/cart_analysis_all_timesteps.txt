Obstacle 319 is in the same lane as the ego vehicle (lanelet 10988) starting at t=0.6s.  The y-coordinates of ego and obstacle 319 are getting closer over time, indicating a possible rear-end collision risk. The x-coordinates are also converging.

Obstacle 355 starts in a different lanelet (10981) than the ego vehicle, but at t=0.9s it's located in lanelet 10124. It's moving considerably faster than the ego vehicle.  While the data doesn't provide enough information about lanelet connectivity and future trajectories, the high speed of Obstacle 355 relative to the ego warrants attention.

Obstacle 33 consistently remains in lanelet 10184 which appears to be different from the ego vehicle's lanelets.  While it's accelerating, its position doesn't suggest an immediate collision risk.

Given the lane sharing and decreasing distance between Ego and Obstacle 319, Obstacle 319 poses an extreme risk.
