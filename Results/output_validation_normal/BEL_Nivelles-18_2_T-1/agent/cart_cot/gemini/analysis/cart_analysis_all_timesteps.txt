At t=0.9s, the ego vehicle is at (-409.4165, -182.8337) in lanelet 10988. Let's analyze the risk posed by each obstacle:

* **Obstacle 33:** Position (-402.54934, -159.85712), lanelet 10184. This obstacle is significantly north of the ego vehicle and moving roughly parallel.  While the lanelets suggest these vehicles are not likely to interact soon, the lateral distance is not excessively large. Given the current trajectories and moderate relative velocity, there's ample time for the ego vehicle to react should Obstacle 33's behavior change unexpectedly.

* **Obstacle 319:** Position (-414.16946, -196.65084), lanelet 10988. This obstacle is in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle and somewhat behind it. It's approaching the ego vehicle from behind. The longitudinal distance is not large. However, obstacle 319 and ego vehicle both accelerate with a positive acceleration, collision risk is relatively low.  Overall, obstacle 319 doesn't represent an immediate threat, but poses a risk and its proximity warrants attention.

* **Obstacle 355:** Position (-408.71962, -202.11612), lanelet 10124. This obstacle is close to the ego vehicle, especially in the y-direction.  This obstacle is south to ego vehicle, lanelets information shows it's less likely to have collision in current situation. Although immediate collision is unlikely given the current trajectories, this is a close proximity situation demanding careful monitoring.

**Calculations (approximations based on latest provided timestep data):**

We can approximate TTC and MDC values for t=0.9s:

* **Obstacle 33:**  MDC ≈ 23 meters (primarily lateral), TTC is not meaningful in the current configuration given parallel movement.
* **Obstacle 319:** MDC ≈ 14 meters (primarily longitudinal), TTC is not meaningful to calculate given its current trajectory.
* **Obstacle 355:** MDC ≈ 19 meters (primarily lateral), TTC is not meaningful in the current configuration given their trajectories.

**Risk Assessment:**

* **Obstacle 33:** Low Risk (4) - Distant and parallel trajectory.
* **Obstacle 319:** Medium Risk (3) - Same lane, approaching from behind, but at modest speed.
* **Obstacle 355:** Low Risk (4) - Close in proximity and different lanelets.
