At t=0.9s, the ego vehicle is in lanelet 10988. Let's analyze the obstacles:

* **Obstacle 33:** Located in lanelet 10184.  While it's approaching the ego vehicle laterally, it maintains a safe lateral distance and is in a different lanelet.  Therefore, the risk is low.

* **Obstacle 319:** Located in the same lanelet (10988) as the ego vehicle. It is behind the ego vehicle and moving slower. This does not represent an immediate risk.

* **Obstacle 355:** This obstacle has transitioned to lanelet 10124. While previously it shared lanelet 10981 with the ego for a duration and was accelerating quickly, resulting in a medium risk score at earlier timesteps. Now, as it has changed lanelets the risk is now assessed as low.
