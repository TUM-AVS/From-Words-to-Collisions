To analyze the provided scenario, I will evaluate the potential collisions involving the ego vehicle and obstacles at the most recent timestamp (0.9 seconds) while considering their trajectories from the previous timestamps.

**Scenario Analysis:**

1. **Ego Vehicle (at 0.9 seconds):**
   - Position: (-409.4165, -182.8337)
   - Velocity: 10.5994 m/s
   - Current lanelet: 10988.0

2. **Obstacle 33.0 (at 0.9 seconds):**
   - Position: (-402.54934, -159.85712)
   - Velocity: 14.469698 m/s
   - Current lanelet: 10184.0
   - Since the obstacle is on a different lanelet and the relative distance is significant, immediate collision risk with the ego vehicle is low.

3. **Obstacle 319.0 (at 0.9 seconds):**
   - Position: (-414.16946, -196.65084)
   - Velocity: 13.461331 m/s
   - Current lanelet: 10988.0
   - This obstacle is on the same lanelet and has a significant relative longitudinal position behind (-414.16946 + 409.4165) = -4.75296 m and approaching at a rate (relative velocity) of (13.461331 - 10.5994) = 2.861931 m/s. 
   - TTC = 4.75296 / 2.861931 â‰ˆ 1.66 seconds. While the lateral separation also suggests proximity, there is a manageable risk with proper reaction.

4. **Obstacle 355.0 (at 0.9 seconds):**
   - Position: (-408.71962, -202.11612)
   - Velocity: 20.570709 m/s
   - Current lanelet: 10124.0
   - Since this obstacle is not on the same lanelet and the relative position does not indicate an immediate threat, it remains at negligible risk.

**Conclusion:**
- **Obstacle 319.0** shows a moderate risk due to its approaching trajectory, being in the same lanelet, and having a relatively short time to collision, qualifying for a High Risk score.
