At the most recent timestep (0.9 seconds):

* **Obstacle 33:** This obstacle is behind the ego vehicle and moving towards it.  While it is approaching, it's still -19.47m away longitudinally. Given the current relative velocity and acceleration, it doesn't pose an immediate collision risk. It requires monitoring but is not currently a high risk.

* **Obstacle 319:** This obstacle is in front of the ego vehicle and moving further away, posing no risk.

* **Obstacle 355:**  This obstacle is in the front-left, moving away longitudinally but slightly towards the ego vehicle laterally.  However, it's at a safe lateral and longitudinal distance, so it doesn't represent a high risk.

Therefore, at the most recent timestep, no obstacles present a collision or extreme risk.
