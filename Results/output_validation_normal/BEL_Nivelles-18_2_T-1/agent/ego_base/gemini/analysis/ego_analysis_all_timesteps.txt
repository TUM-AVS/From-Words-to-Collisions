At t=0.9s:

* **Obstacle 33:** This obstacle is behind the ego vehicle and approaching with a longitudinal relative velocity of 3.84 m/s.  The longitudinal distance is -19.47m (negative indicates behind). While it is approaching, it's not an immediate threat. Risk level: Medium (3).

* **Obstacle 319:** This obstacle is in front of the ego vehicle and moving away with a longitudinal relative velocity of 2.84 m/s and a distance of 10.09 m. Risk level: Negligible (5).

* **Obstacle 355:** This obstacle is in the front-left, moving away longitudinally (9.93 m/s, 13.79 m) but approaching laterally (-1.27 m/s, 4.51 m).  The lateral movement needs monitoring, but the longitudinal movement reduces the immediate risk. Risk level: Medium (3).
