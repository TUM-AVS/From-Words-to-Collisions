### Safety analysis for timestep 0.9s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

**- Obstacle ID: 33**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is behind the ego vehicle at a safe distance (DTClong = -19.47m, DTClat = -19.47m).  The negative longitudinal distance indicates it's behind.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: While the obstacle is approaching from behind (Vrel_long = 3.84 m/s), the distance is substantial, and no immediate collision risk is apparent.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

**- Obstacle ID: 319**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is in front of the ego vehicle at a safe distance (DTClong = 10.09m, DTClat = 10.09m).
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: The obstacle is moving further away longitudinally (Vrel_long = 2.84 m/s), decreasing collision risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

**- Obstacle ID: 355**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is in front-left of the ego vehicle at a safe distance (DTClong = 13.79m, DTClat = 13.79m).
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: The obstacle is moving further away longitudinally (Vrel_long = 9.93 m/s) but slightly towards the ego vehicle laterally (Vrel_lat = -1.27 m/s). The lateral movement poses minimal risk due to the significant longitudinal distance.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4
