Let me analyze each obstacle at the most recent timestep (0.9 seconds):

1. Obstacle 33 (Behind):
- Longitudinal distance: -19.47m (behind ego)
- Lateral distance: 0.00m (same lane)
- Relative velocity: longitudinal 3.84 m/s (approaching), lateral -0.91 m/s (moving slightly right)
- TTC calculation: 19.47/3.84 = 5.07 seconds (longitudinal)
- MDC: Current lateral distance is 0.00m but moving away laterally (-0.91 m/s)
- Risk assessment: 
  - Longitudinal: TTC >5s (No Risk)
  - Lateral: Moving away (No Risk)
- Overall Risk: 5 (Negligible)

2. Obstacle 319 (Front):
- Longitudinal distance: 10.09m (ahead)
- Lateral distance: 0.00m (same lane)
- Relative velocity: longitudinal 2.84 m/s (moving away), lateral -0.84 m/s (moving left)
- TTC: Not applicable (moving away)
- MDC: Current lateral distance 0.00m but moving away laterally
- Risk assessment:
  - Longitudinal: Moving away (No Risk)
  - Lateral: Moving away (No Risk)
- Overall Risk: 5 (Negligible)

3. Obstacle 355 (Front-left):
- Longitudinal distance: 13.79m (ahead)
- Lateral distance: 4.51m (left)
- Relative velocity: longitudinal 9.93 m/s (moving away quickly), lateral -1.27 m/s (approaching from left)
- TTC calculation:
  - Longitudinal: Moving away (N/A)
  - Lateral: 4.51/1.27 = 3.55 seconds
- MDC: Lateral distance is 4.51m (Low Risk range)
- Risk assessment:
  - Longitudinal: Moving away (No Risk)
  - Lateral: TTC 3.55s (Low Risk)
- Overall Risk: 4 (Low Risk)

Trajectory Analysis:
- Obstacle 33 is approaching from behind but at safe distance (>19m)
- Obstacle 319 is moving away in front
- Obstacle 355 is moving away longitudinally but slowly approaching laterally (still >4.5m away)
