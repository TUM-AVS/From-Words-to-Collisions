Obstacle 33 (Behind):
- Trajectory: Consistently behind the ego vehicle and laterally aligned (0.00m lateral distance). Longitudinal distance is decreasing across all timesteps, indicating it is approaching the ego vehicle from behind.
- At 0.9s: Longitudinal distance is -19.47m, relative velocity is 3.84 m/s.
- TTC (longitudinal): -19.47m / 3.84m/s ≈ -5.07s (Not applicable for collision risk since negative, but indicates closing).
- MDC: Not directly applicable due to the position behind the ego vehicle. The primary concern is the closing longitudinal distance, which is still significant.
- Risk Assessment: Low risk (4) due to the substantial distance, despite the closing velocity.

Obstacle 319 (Front):
- Trajectory: Consistently in front of the ego vehicle and laterally aligned (0.00m lateral distance). Longitudinal distance initially increases slightly, then remains relatively stable from 0.4s onwards. The obstacle's longitudinal motion indicates it is moving away from the ego car.
- At 0.9s: Longitudinal distance is 10.09m, relative velocity is 2.84 m/s.
- TTC (longitudinal): 10.09m / 2.84m/s ≈ 3.55s 
- MDC: Not applicable due to increasing distance
- Risk Assessment: Low risk (4) due to the safe distance and separating motion.

Obstacle 355 (Front-Left):
- Trajectory: Starts front-left and moves further away longitudinally while slightly approaching laterally. 
- At 0.9s: Longitudinal distance is 13.79m, lateral distance is 4.51m, longitudinal relative velocity is 9.93m/s (moving away), lateral relative velocity is -1.27m/s (approaching).
- TTC (longitudinal): 13.79m / 9.93m/s ≈ 1.39s (moving away, so not a collision risk).
- TTC (lateral): 4.51m/1.27m/s ≈ 3.55s
- MDC: Due to diverging longitudinal trajectory and a safe lateral distance, MDC is not a major concern.
- Risk Assessment: Low risk (4) based on the overall trajectory and distances.
