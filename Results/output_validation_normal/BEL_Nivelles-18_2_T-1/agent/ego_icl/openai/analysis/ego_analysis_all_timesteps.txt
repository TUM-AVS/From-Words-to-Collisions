### Obstacle-by-Obstacle Analysis

#### Obstacle 33
- **Position and Motion**: Behind the ego vehicle, exact longitudinal alignment, moving towards the ego vehicle.
- **Adjusted Distances**: Longitudinal: -19.47 m, Lateral: 0.00 m.
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal: 3.84 m/s (approaching), Lateral: -0.91 m/s.
- **Trajectory Analysis**: Speed increasing from previous timestamps, moving towards the ego vehicle.
- **TTC Calculation (Longitudinal)**: \( \text{TTC} = \frac{19.47}{3.84} \approx 5.07 \) seconds.
- **MDC Calculation**: Given direct alignment behind the ego vehicle with increasing velocity and decreasing distance, MDC depends on continued trajectory. Still, significant distance exists with decreasing trend aligning with the longitudinal trajectory.
- **Risk Evaluation**: Given the significant time until the ego can be caught and the increasing distance, the risk is low.
- **Risk Score**: 4

#### Obstacle 319
- **Position and Motion**: In front of the ego vehicle, moving away longitudinally.
- **Adjusted Distances**: Longitudinal: 10.09 m, Lateral: 0.00 m.
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal: 2.84 m/s (moving away), Lateral: -0.84 m/s.
- **Trajectory Analysis**: Velocity trend confirms moving away from ego vehicle.
- **TTC Calculation (not applicable as moving away)**: Since the vehicle is moving away, collision risk based on longitudinal trajectory is negligible.
- **MDC Calculation**: Not applicable as the obstacle is moving away.
- **Risk Evaluation**: No risk due to the obstacle moving away at increasing distances.
- **Risk Score**: 5

#### Obstacle 355
- **Position and Motion**: Front-left of the ego vehicle, moving away longitudinally but approaching laterally.
- **Adjusted Distances**: Longitudinal: 13.79 m, Lateral: 4.51 m.
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal: 9.93 m/s (moving away), Lateral: -1.27 m/s (approaching).
- **Trajectory Analysis**: Moving away longitudinally yet closing laterally.
- **TTC Calculation (Lateral)**: \( \text{TTC} = \frac{4.51}{1.27} \approx 3.55 \) seconds.
- **MDC Calculation**: Verified to be in the safe zone given the decrease in lateral distance but moving away longitudinally.
- **Risk Evaluation**: Medium risk due to lateral closing while longitudinally diverging, however, sufficient time provided to act.
- **Risk Score**: 3

### Summary
- **Obstacle 33** has a low risk as it approaches from behind but exhibits a considerable longitudinal distance, allowing ample reaction time.
- **Obstacle 319** poses no risk due to its movement away from the ego vehicle.
- **Obstacle 355** presents a medium risk chiefly because of lateral closing; however, the longitudinal trajectory trends away, offering a manageable risk level.

This analysis accounts for trajectory and velocity trends, showing that no immediate or critical risks necessitating urgent action were found. Adjusted distances confirm no collisions or extreme risks ensue on these trajectories.
