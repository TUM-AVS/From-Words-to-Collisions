At t=0.9s, Ego is in lanelet 10988.

Obstacle 319 is also in lanelet 10988, posing a high risk.  Its position (-414.16946, -196.65084) is very close to Ego's (-409.4165, -182.8337), and they are moving in roughly the same direction (similar orientations). The trajectories over the past timesteps suggest they are converging. This is extremely risky and could easily become a collision in the next timestep.

Obstacle 355 is now in lanelet 10124. While its velocity (20.57) is high, its current position (-408.71962, -202.11612) places it further from the ego vehicle and it appears to be moving away based on the trajectory.  Thus, despite the high velocity, it does not present an immediate collision risk at this specific timestep.

Obstacle 33 is in a different lanelet (10184) and its position (-402.54934, -159.85712) suggests no immediate risk to Ego.
