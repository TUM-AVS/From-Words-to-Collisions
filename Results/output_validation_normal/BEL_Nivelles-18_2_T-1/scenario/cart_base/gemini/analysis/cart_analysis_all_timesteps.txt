At t=0.9s, Ego is in lanelet 10988.

Obstacle 319 is also in lanelet 10988, posing a high risk.  Its position (-414.16946, -196.65084) is very close to Ego's (-409.4165, -182.8337), and they are moving in roughly the same direction (similar orientations). While not an immediate collision, the proximity and shared lanelet make a collision likely soon if their trajectories don't diverge.

Obstacle 355 has moved to lanelet 10124. It's further away from the ego vehicle and doesn't pose an immediate collision risk.


Obstacle 33 is in a different lanelet (10184) and poses no immediate risk.
