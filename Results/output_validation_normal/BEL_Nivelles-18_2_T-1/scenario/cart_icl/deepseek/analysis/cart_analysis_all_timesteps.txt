### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep (0.9 seconds):

### Obstacle Analysis:
1. **Obstacle ID: 33.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Moving away from the ego vehicle in both X and Y coordinates over time. The distance is increasing.
   - **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: Relative velocity is positive (obstacle is moving away), and acceleration is decreasing.
   - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)

2. **Obstacle ID: 319.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Moving in the same lanelet (10988.0) as the ego vehicle but at a safe distance behind. The distance is stable over time.
   - **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: Relative velocity is low (ego: 10.5994, obstacle: 13.461331), and acceleration is stable.
   - **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low Risk)

3. **Obstacle ID: 355.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Moving away from the ego vehicle in both X and Y coordinates over time. The distance is increasing.
   - **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: Relative velocity is high (obstacle: 20.570709) but moving away, and acceleration is stable.
   - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. **Obstacle 33.0**: Moving away, no collision risk.
2. **Obstacle 319.0**: In the same lanelet but at a safe distance behind, low risk.
3. **Obstacle 355.0**: Moving away, no collision risk.
- **Conclusion**: No immediate or high-risk collision scenarios detected.
