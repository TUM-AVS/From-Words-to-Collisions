### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 33
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 33 is in a different lanelet and its y-coordinate is significantly smaller than the ego vehicle's, indicating no immediate risk. The trajectories show diverging paths.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Relative velocities and accelerations do not indicate a collision course based on current trajectories.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 319
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 319 is in lanelet 10988 while the ego vehicle has just entered 10988. The y-coordinate difference is small and decreasing, indicating potential risk.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: The obstacle is behind the ego vehicle and traveling at a slightly lower speed. This lessens the immediate risk, but the closing distance needs monitoring.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3

- Obstacle ID: 329
- Distance Risk reason:  This obstacle is in a different lanelet and far behind the ego vehicle.  Poses no immediate risk.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Relative positions and velocities indicate no collision risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 355
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 355 is in a different lanelet and its y-coordinate is slightly smaller than the ego vehicle's. The trajectories show no immediate intersection.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Although obstacle 355 has a high velocity, its trajectory does not intersect with the ego vehicle's in the short term.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- Obstacle ID: 357
- Distance Risk reason: This obstacle is in a different lanelet and its x and y coordinates are significantly smaller than the ego vehicle, indicating no immediate risk.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Relative velocities and accelerations suggest no imminent collision based on trajectories.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
No obstacles are on a direct collision course with the ego vehicle in the immediate future. Obstacle 319 presents the highest risk due to proximity but is currently behind and moving slower than the ego vehicle.


### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
  "CollisionObstacles": [],
  "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null,
  "ScenarioAnalysis": {
    "IsCollisionScenario": false,
    "Reasoning": "No obstacle has a risk score of 0. While obstacle 319 has a moderate risk score of 3 due to its proximity, it is currently behind the ego vehicle and traveling slower, thus not posing an immediate collision risk."
  }
