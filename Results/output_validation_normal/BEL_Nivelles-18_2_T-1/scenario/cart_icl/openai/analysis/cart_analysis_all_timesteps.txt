### Obstacle Analysis:

#### Obstacle 33.0
- **Distance Risk Reason**: Obstacle 33.0 is persistently located in a different lanelet from the ego vehicle. Although it is approaching and accelerating, it does not cross into Ego's path over the recorded time.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 4 (Low risk, mainly due to lanelet separation)

- **Time Risk Reason**: The obstacle shows a consistent increase in velocity and acceleration, suggesting potential future closeness, but it remains significantly apart in terms of lanelets.
- **Time Safety Score**: 4 (Low risk considering its trajectory and relative velocity)

- **Overall Risk Score**: 4

#### Obstacle 319.0
- **Distance Risk Reason**: At the most recent timestep, Obstacle 319.0 is in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle and approaching faster, implying a potential collision risk if trends continue.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 3 (Medium risk due to proximity in the same lanelet)

- **Time Risk Reason**: The relative velocity and consistent acceleration towards Ego imply a relatively short time to potential collision.
- **Time Safety Score**: 2 (High risk, mainly due to closing speed and same lanelet trajectory)

- **Overall Risk Score**: 3 (Medium risk, needs monitoring)

#### Obstacle 329.0
- **Distance Risk Reason**: This obstacle is in a different lanelet and shows minimal changes in position relative to the ego vehicle.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 5 (Negligible risk)

- **Time Risk Reason**: The velocity is stable while remaining out of Ego's path, no immediate collision threat.
- **Time Safety Score**: 5 (Negligible risk)

- **Overall Risk Score**: 5

#### Obstacle 355.0
- **Distance Risk Reason**: Obstacle 355.0 remains in a different lanelet, although it shows some proximity due to high speed.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 3 (Medium risk due to speed increment)

- **Time Risk Reason**: Increased velocity and trajectory could potentially intersect with the ego vehicle's future path if not corrected, posing a possible threat over time.
- **Time Safety Score**: 3 (Medium risk as it could become a threat)

- **Overall Risk Score**: 3

#### Obstacle 357.0
- **Distance Risk Reason**: The obstacle is consistently located in a different lanelet, keeping a safe distance from the ego vehicle's trajectory.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 5 (Negligible risk)

- **Time Risk Reason**: Its speed and orientation suggest it is moving away or parallel without threatening interaction.
- **Time Safety Score**: 5 (Negligible risk)

- **Overall Risk Score**: 5

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
Upon examining the trajectory and position history of each obstacle relative to the ego vehicle, none are currently on a direct collision path. While Obstacle 319.0 is in the same lanelet and closing in, its current and near-future positions have not yet indicated an imminent collision, largely due to the short duration of the data. However, consistent monitoring and possible mild corrective action may be required for risk mitigation.
