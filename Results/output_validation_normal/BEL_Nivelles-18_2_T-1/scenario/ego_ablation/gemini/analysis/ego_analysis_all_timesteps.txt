Obstacle 33 is behind the ego vehicle and approaching, but it is still relatively far away (-19.47m).  While its longitudinal relative velocity is increasing, there's no immediate danger of collision. Obstacle 319 is in front of the ego vehicle and moving further away, posing no risk. Obstacle 355 is also moving away longitudinally and its lateral movement does not represent an immediate risk given the current distance (13.79m longitudinal, 4.51m lateral).
