At t=0.9s:
- **Obstacle 33:** This obstacle is behind the ego vehicle and approaching it longitudinally with a relative velocity of 3.84 m/s.  While it's closing the distance, the longitudinal distance is still -19.47m.  It doesn't pose an immediate collision risk in the next timestep.
- **Obstacle 319:** This obstacle is in front of the ego vehicle and moving away longitudinally with a relative velocity of 2.84 m/s. It poses no risk.
- **Obstacle 355:** This obstacle is in the front-left, moving away longitudinally (9.93 m/s) but approaching laterally (-1.27 m/s).  Although it is moving towards the ego car laterally, the longitudinal movement significantly reduces the risk of an immediate collision.  Given the current distances (13.79m longitudinal and 4.51m lateral) a collision in the next timestep is unlikely.

Since none of the obstacles pose an immediate collision risk, the scenario isn't a collision scenario.
