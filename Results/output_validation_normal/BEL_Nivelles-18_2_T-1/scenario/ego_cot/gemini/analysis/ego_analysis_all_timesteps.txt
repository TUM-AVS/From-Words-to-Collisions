### Safety analysis for timestep 0.9 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 33**
- Distance Risk reason:  Obstacle 33 is behind the ego vehicle at a longitudinal distance of -19.47m and a lateral distance of -19.47m.  The negative longitudinal distance indicates it's behind the ego vehicle. The lateral distance suggests it is not directly behind but somewhat offset.  While not an immediate threat, its motion indicates it is approaching the ego vehicle.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason:  We need more information to accurately calculate TTC.  The provided data shows the obstacle is closing in longitudinally, but without consistent acceleration data, precise TTC calculation is difficult. Since the obstacle is approaching, some risk exists.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 319**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 319 is in front of the ego vehicle at a longitudinal distance of 10.09m and a lateral distance of 10.09m. The positive longitudinal distance and the motion description ("moving away longitudinally") indicate no immediate risk.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: The obstacle is moving away longitudinally, further reducing any collision risk.  The lateral movement doesn't pose an immediate threat due to sufficient distance.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 355**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 355 is in the front-left of the ego vehicle at a longitudinal distance of 13.79m and a lateral distance of 13.79m. Although the obstacle is moving away longitudinally, it is moving toward the ego vehicle laterally. However, the distances are still significant.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: The increasing longitudinal distance mitigates some risk.  While the lateral motion is concerning, the distance and limited time window analyzed (0.9 seconds) suggest a low immediate risk.  We need more data to assess longer-term lateral movement risk.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4
