Let me analyze each obstacle at the most recent timestep (0.9 seconds) and determine the collision risk.

### Obstacle 33 (Behind)
- Position: Longitudinal -19.47m, Lateral 0.00m (exact lateral alignment)
- Relative velocity: Longitudinal 3.84 m/s (approaching), Lateral -0.91 m/s (moving right)
- Motion: Driving toward ego from behind
- Analysis:
  - Longitudinal TTC = 19.47/3.84 = 5.07s (No Risk)
  - Lateral distance stable at 0.00m but moving away (-0.91m/s)
  - MDC is effectively infinite since trajectories are diverging laterally
  - Overall Risk: 5 (No Risk)

### Obstacle 319 (Front)
- Position: Longitudinal 10.09m, Lateral 0.00m (exact lateral alignment)
- Relative velocity: Longitudinal 2.84 m/s (moving away), Lateral -0.84 m/s (moving right)
- Motion: Moving away longitudinally
- Analysis:
  - TTC not applicable (moving away in both dimensions)
  - MDC is effectively infinite (diverging paths)
  - Overall Risk: 5 (No Risk)

### Obstacle 355 (Front-left)
- Position: Longitudinal 13.79m, Lateral 4.51m
- Relative velocity: Longitudinal 9.93 m/s (moving away), Lateral -1.27 m/s (approaching)
- Motion: Moving away longitudinally but approaching laterally
- Analysis:
  - Lateral TTC = 4.51/1.27 = 3.55s (Low Risk)
  - MDC is the current lateral distance (4.51m) since longitudinal distance is increasing
  - Overall Risk: 4 (Low Risk)

### Trajectory Analysis
Looking at previous timesteps:
- Obstacle 33 is gradually increasing speed toward ego but still far away
- Obstacle 319 is consistently moving away from ego
- Obstacle 355 is maintaining steady lateral approach while moving away longitudinally

### Collision Scenario Determination
No obstacles meet the criteria for:
- Collision (score 0)
- Extreme Risk (score 1)

The closest risk is Obstacle 355 with Low Risk (score 4).

### Final JSON Summary
```json
{
    "CollisionObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": null,
        "OverallRiskScore": null
    },
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": null,
        "OverallRiskScore": null
    },
    "IsCollisionScenario": false,
    "Justification": "No obstacles have collision (0) or extreme risk (1) scores. The highest risk is Obstacle 355 with Low Risk (4) due to lateral approach while moving away longitudinally."
}
