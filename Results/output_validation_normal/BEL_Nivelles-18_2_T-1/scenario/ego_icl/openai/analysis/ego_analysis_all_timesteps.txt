Let's analyze the collision risks for each obstacle at the most recent timestep, which is 0.9 seconds.

## Obstacle 33:
- **Position**: Behind the ego vehicle
- **Adjusted Longitudinal Distance**: -19.47 m 
- **Adjusted Lateral Distance**: 0.00 m 
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal 3.84 m/s, Lateral -0.91 m/s
- **Relative Acceleration**: Longitudinal -0.32 m/s², Lateral -0.87 m/s²
- **Trajectory and Motion**: Obstacle is driving toward the ego car from behind with exact lateral alignment.
  
**TTC Calculation**:
- Longitudinal: TTC_long = |Distance_long| / Relative Velocity_long = |-19.47| / 3.84 = 5.07 seconds (approx)
- Lateral movement is minimal due to alignment, less impact on the collision assessment.

**MDC Calculation**:
- Primary risk for rear obstacle is based on longitudinal distance, which remains > 5 m across the timestep without sharp convergence.
  
**Risk Assessment**:
- Both TTC > 5 seconds and MDC > 5 meters indicate a **No Risk** (5) for immediate collision.

## Obstacle 319:
- **Position**: In front of the ego vehicle
- **Adjusted Longitudinal Distance**: 10.09 m
- **Adjusted Lateral Distance**: 0.00 m
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal 2.84 m/s, Lateral -0.84 m/s
- **Relative Acceleration**: Longitudinal -0.77 m/s², Lateral -2.13 m/s²
- **Trajectory and Motion**: Obstacle moving away, with exact lateral alignment and increasing longitudinal distance.

**TTC Calculation**:
- Longitudinal: Not applicable as the vehicle is moving away.
  
**MDC Calculation**:
- Primarily on longitudinal position due to alignment; increasing distance further reduces risk.

**Risk Assessment**:
- As the relative position is increasing and the obstacle moves away, we maintain a risk score of **No Risk** (5).

## Obstacle 355:
- **Position**: Front-left of the ego vehicle
- **Adjusted Longitudinal Distance**: 13.79 m
- **Adjusted Lateral Distance**: 4.51 m
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal 9.93 m/s, Lateral -1.27 m/s
- **Relative Acceleration**: Longitudinal -0.73 m/s², Lateral -2.02 m/s²
- **Trajectory and Motion**: Moving away longitudinally but approaching laterally toward the ego car.

**TTC Calculation**:
- Lateral: TTC_lat = |Distance_lat| / |Relative Velocity_lat| = |4.51| / 1.27 = 3.55 seconds (approx).

**MDC Calculation**:
- Given both trajectories, MDC measured when crossing path risks are marginally accounted, considering a lateral approach but longitudinal withdrawal.

**Risk Assessment**:
- Given the increasing longitudinal and partially offset lateral closing, the effective risk remains at **No Risk** (5), even with lateral convergence.

## Conclusion
For all obstacles, there are no immediate risk indications due to adequate separation, increasing longitudinal distances, and lack of rapid approach indicators. Thus, this scenario does not meet the threshold of a collision. All calculated TTC figures are substantial to allow braking or evasive actions if necessary.
