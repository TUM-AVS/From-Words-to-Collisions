Obstacle 335 poses a high risk of collision.  Initially, it is in a different lanelet (10691) than the Ego vehicle (10934). However, by 0.7 seconds, obstacle 335 has moved into the Ego vehicle's lanelet (10934). Both are moving in roughly the same direction (slightly converging orientations) and obstacle 335's x-position is getting closer to the Ego vehicle's x-position over the observed timesteps.  While the Ego vehicle is decelerating, Obstacle 335 is moving with a positive velocity.  The combination of lane change by Obstacle 335 and the closing distance suggests a high risk of collision if current trajectories are maintained.

Obstacles 312 and 329 are consistently in different lanelets and maintain a sufficient distance from the Ego vehicle throughout the observed timesteps, thus presenting negligible risk.
