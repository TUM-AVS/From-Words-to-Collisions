Obstacle 335 poses a high risk of collision. Initially, it is in a different lane (10691) than the ego vehicle (10934). However, at t=0.7s, obstacle 335's lanelet changes to 10934, the same as the ego vehicle.  Simultaneously, the distance between the ego vehicle and obstacle 335 is decreasing while both are traveling in the same direction. This creates a high risk of a rear-end collision if the ego vehicle does not decelerate or obstacle 335 doesn't accelerate/change lanes.  The other obstacles are not a significant risk as their trajectories and lanelets indicate no immediate danger to the ego vehicle.
