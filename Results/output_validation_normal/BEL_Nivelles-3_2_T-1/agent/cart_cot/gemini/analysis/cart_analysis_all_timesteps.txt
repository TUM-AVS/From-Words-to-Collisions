Here's the collision risk analysis for the provided scenario:

**Analysis at t=0.9s:**

* **Ego Vehicle (ID 1.0):**
    * Position: (-902.3943, -643.3602)
    * Velocity: 6.9209
    * Acceleration: 0.2422
    * Orientation: -0.8123 radians

* **Obstacle 312.0:**
    * Position: (-881.52483, -658.05095)
    * Velocity: 0.3599846
    * Acceleration: -0.1226858
    * This obstacle is relatively far from the ego vehicle and poses no immediate threat.

* **Obstacle 329.0:**
    * Position: (-887.63274, -655.0779)
    * Velocity: 0.63409122
    * Acceleration: -0.311224
    * This obstacle is also relatively far and not on a direct collision course.  

* **Obstacle 335.0:**
    * Position: (-911.77363, -639.30559)
    * Velocity: 6.8608586
    * Acceleration: 0.3270265
    * This obstacle is the closest to the ego vehicle.  It is important to analyze its trajectory relative to the ego vehicle to determine the risk of collision.


**Risk Assessment:**

Given that the provided dataset has relatively sparse time intervals (0.1s), precise TTC and MDC calculations are difficult. However, we can make approximations and qualitative assessments based on the given data:

* **Ego Vehicle vs. Obstacle 335.0:**  Obstacle 335 and the Ego vehicle are in the same lanelet (10934) based on the most recent data and also close in Y values, indicating potential for a collision. Both vehicles have comparable velocities (ego - 6.92, obstacle - 6.86).  Since obstacle 335 is behind and to the left of the ego vehicle, there's risk if ego vehicle turns more to the left. While the distance between them might not indicate a collision in the next second, if current trajectories hold, there's a possibility for collision in the coming seconds.

* **Ego Vehicle vs. Obstacles 312 and 329:** These obstacles are much further away from the ego vehicle. Given their current speeds and positions, they don't pose an immediate threat.


**Predictions:**

* At the present time, if the current trajectories for ego and obstacle 335 hold, and there's a lane change maneuver by the ego towards the left, there is a chance of a collision. This would indicate a high risk.
