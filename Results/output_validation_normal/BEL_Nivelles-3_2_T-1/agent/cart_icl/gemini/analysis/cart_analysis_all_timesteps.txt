At t=0.9s, the ego vehicle is at (-902.39, -643.36) with a velocity of 6.92 m/s and an orientation of -0.81 radians.  Let's analyze the risk posed by each obstacle:

* **Obstacle 312:** Located far laterally and longitudinally with minimal relative velocity changes, posing no immediate risk.  Risk: **Negligible (5)**

* **Obstacle 329:**  Located laterally and slightly behind the ego vehicle. While in a different lanelet, its slow velocity and minimal relative motion suggest low risk. Risk: **Low (4)**

* **Obstacle 335:** This obstacle is in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle and is closing in. It's located ahead of the ego vehicle at (-911.77, -639.31) with a velocity of 6.86 m/s. This suggests a potential risk.  Approximating TTC using the most recent time step:
    - Longitudinal distance: -911.77 - (-902.39) = -9.38m (ego is behind)
    - Longitudinal velocity difference (ego - obstacle): 6.92 - 6.86 = 0.06 m/s (closing very slowly)
    - Approximate TTC: -9.38 / 0.06 = -156.33 seconds. Lateral distance is approximately: -639.31 - (-643.36) = 4.05 m.  It's unlikely to collide within a reasonable lookahead window. Risk: **Low (4)**
