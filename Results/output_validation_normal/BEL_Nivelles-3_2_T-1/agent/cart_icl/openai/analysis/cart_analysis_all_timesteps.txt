## Detailed Evaluation:

### Ego Vehicle Analysis:
- As of the latest time step at 0.9 seconds, the Ego vehicle is positioned at (-902.3943, -643.3602) in lanelet 10934.0, with an orientation of -0.8123 radians. 
- The velocity of the Ego vehicle is 6.9209 m/s, and it is slightly accelerating with 0.2422 m/sÂ².
- Given that the Ego remains in the same lanelet throughout the scenario, it suggests a relatively stable trajectory.

### Obstacle Analysis:
- **Obstacle 312**: Located at (-881.52483, -658.05095) in lanelet 10962.0, with a very low velocity of 0.3599846 m/s, maintaining a significant lateral distance from Ego and not in the same lanelet. Minimal risk is posed by this obstacle.
  
- **Obstacle 329**: Positioned at (-887.63274, -655.0779) in lanelet 10912.0, moving at 0.63409122 m/s. This obstacle is significantly ahead of the Ego vehicle with a lateral distance. The relative velocity suggests no imminent collision risk.

- **Obstacle 335**: Positioned at (-911.77363, -639.30559) with a moderate velocity of 6.8608586 m/s in the same lanelet (10934.0) as the Ego. The obstacle's trajectory is closing in on the Ego vehicle (same lanelet, increasing closeness).

### Risk Analysis:
- The most concerning obstacle is **Obstacle 335**, which has the same lanelet as the Ego vehicle upon entering the 0.7-second mark and continues to remain in close proximity by 0.9 seconds. The trajectory suggests convergence with a relatively low time to collision (TTC). This indicates a potential collision if no adjustments are made quickly.
  
- **TTC Calculation for Obstacle 335**: 
  - Relative longitudinal position (at 0.9s): Approximately 9.38 meters (ahead of Ego)
  - Relative longitudinal velocity: |6.8609 - 6.9209| = 0.06 m/s (approaching)
  - **TTC** = 9.38 / 0.06 = Approximately 156.33 seconds, suggests converging, however, they remain in the same lanelet, increasing risk of direct contact soon.
  
  Despite the long TTC here, the same lanelet presence with natural trajectory convergence increases risk significantly.

- **Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC)** for Obstacle 335: Given the small lateral offset and closing relative position, there is potential for MDC to decrease unsafely.
  
### Conclusions:
- Obstacle 335 poses an **Extreme Risk (1)** due to the same lanelet presence and encroaching trajectory. Immediate action such as lane change or speed adjustment is necessary to prevent collision.
  
- Other obstacles, given their trajectories and lanelets, maintain low or negligible risk levels.
