At t=0.9s, Obstacle 329 is closest to the ego vehicle with a longitudinal distance of 14.15m and a small lateral distance of 1.05m, indicating potential risk. It's moving towards the ego longitudinally at -6.36 m/s and laterally at 0.30 m/s.  While the lateral movement slightly increases the lateral distance, the longitudinal velocity poses a moderate concern. Obstacle 312 is further away longitudinally (20.51m) and laterally (3.43m) and moving away laterally, posing less of a risk. Obstacle 335 is behind the ego and moving away longitudinally, also posing minimal risk, even though the lateral distance is decreasing.

Given these observations, Obstacle 329 requires attention. Since the prediction horizon is limited, and the combined longitudinal and lateral movement could lead to a risky situation, the risk level with Obstacle 329 is categorized as medium.
