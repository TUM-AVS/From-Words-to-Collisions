At t=0.9s:
- Obstacle 312: Located front-left (20.51m longitudinal, 3.43m lateral), moving towards the ego vehicle longitudinally at -7.27 m/s and laterally at -0.09 m/s.  While approaching, the lateral movement is slight, and the longitudinal distance provides ample reaction time.  This poses a low risk currently.

- Obstacle 329: Located front-left (14.15m longitudinal, 1.05m lateral), moving towards the ego vehicle longitudinally at -6.36 m/s and laterally at 0.30 m/s (away from ego). The longitudinal distance is shorter than 312, requiring more attention.  The lateral movement suggests it may be passing the ego vehicle.  This presents a medium risk.

- Obstacle 335: Located rear-right (-4.89m longitudinal, -2.41m lateral), moving away longitudinally (-0.15 m/s) and laterally towards the ego car at 1.08 m/s.  Although moving closer laterally, the longitudinal movement suggests it is not a significant threat. This is a low risk.
