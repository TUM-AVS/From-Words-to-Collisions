### Safety analysis for timestep 0.9s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 312**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is located at 20.51m longitudinally and 20.51m laterally (front-left), posing no immediate collision risk.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason:  Without clear ego vehicle motion, TTC cannot be precisely calculated. However, the closing longitudinal velocity suggests potential risk if the ego vehicle maintains its course. Lateral motion suggests a decreasing lateral risk as the obstacle is slightly moving away.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 329**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is at 14.15m longitudinally and 14.15m laterally (front-left), indicating a moderate distance risk.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: Similar to Obstacle 312, precise TTC calculation is impossible without ego vehicle motion details. The negative longitudinal velocity and the positive lateral velocity suggest potential risks and necessitate monitoring.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3

- **Obstacle ID: 335**
- Distance Risk reason:  Obstacle is at -4.89m longitudinally and -4.89m laterally (rear-right), suggesting it's moving away.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason:  The obstacle is moving away longitudinally and moving quickly towards ego car laterally from right.  Requires attention
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 4
