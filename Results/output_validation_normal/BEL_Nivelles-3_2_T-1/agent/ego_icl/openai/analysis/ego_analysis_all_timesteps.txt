To analyze the collision risk in the scenario provided, we will focus on the last timestep (0.9 seconds) for each obstacle while considering their trajectories across previous timesteps for a comprehensive assessment.

### Obstacle Analysis

#### Obstacle 312:
- **Last Known Position:** Front-left of ego vehicle
  - **Adjusted Longitudinal Distance:** 20.51 m
  - **Adjusted Lateral Distance:** 3.43 m
- **Relative Velocity:**
  - **Longitudinal:** -7.27 m/s (approaching)
  - **Lateral:** -0.09 m/s (approaching)
- **Motion Description:** Driving towards the ego vehicle longitudinally and from the left.

**Trajectory & Predictions:**
- Consistently approaching longitudinally and laterally.
- Stable reduction in distances over time, consistent with driving towards ego vehicle.

**Risk Assessment:**
- **TTC (Longitudinal):** 20.51 / 7.27 ≈ 2.82 seconds
- **TTC (Lateral):** 3.43 / 0.09 ≈ 38.11 seconds (not relevant due to large time window)
- **MDC Longitudinal:** Approaching aligned in the same lane.
- Assigning a **Medium Risk** score. As the longitudinal TTC is less than 3 seconds but over 1 second, Medium Risk applies.

#### Obstacle 329:
- **Last Known Position:** Front-left of ego vehicle
  - **Adjusted Longitudinal Distance:** 14.15 m
  - **Adjusted Lateral Distance:** 1.05 m
- **Relative Velocity:**
  - **Longitudinal:** -6.36 m/s (approaching)
  - **Lateral:** 0.30 m/s (moving away)
- **Motion Description:** Approaching ego vehicle longitudinally, moving laterally away.

**Trajectory & Predictions:**
- Continuous approach longitudinally with a stable approach rate.
- Small lateral movement away reducing proximity.

**Risk Assessment:**
- **TTC (Longitudinal):** 14.15 / 6.36 ≈ 2.22 seconds
- **TTC (Lateral):** Not relevant here as situation stabilizes due to lateral increase.
- **MDC Longitudinal:** Significant approach requires caution.
- Assigning a **Medium Risk** score. The longitudinal contact risk justifies a medium score due to fast closing distance despite mitigating lateral position increase.

#### Obstacle 335:
- **Last Known Position:** Rear-right of the ego vehicle
  - **Adjusted Longitudinal Distance:** -4.89 m
  - **Adjusted Lateral Distance:** -2.41 m
- **Relative Velocity:**
  - **Longitudinal:** -0.15 m/s (slowly moving away)
  - **Lateral:** 1.08 m/s (approaching from right)
- **Motion Description:** Moving away longitudinally, while laterally approaching from the right.

**Trajectory & Predictions:**
- Longitudinally moving away slightly stabilizing relative position.
- Faster lateral convergence indicates potential future alignment risks on lateral trajectory alone.

**Risk Assessment:**
- **TTC (Longitudinal):** Not applicable, since separation is slightly increasing.
- **TTC (Lateral):** Not immediately concerning due to overall divergent path.
- **MDC Lateral:** Lateral stabilization reduces collision risk significantly.
- Assigning a **Negligible Risk** score due to very slow lateral change and lack of urgency in trajectory intersections.

### Final Risk Interpretation
- **Obstacle 312 and 329**: Medium risk due to reduced longitudinal TTC and consistent approach pattern.
- **Obstacle 335**: Negligible risk, with decreasing lateral proximity reducing the collision trajectory concern.
