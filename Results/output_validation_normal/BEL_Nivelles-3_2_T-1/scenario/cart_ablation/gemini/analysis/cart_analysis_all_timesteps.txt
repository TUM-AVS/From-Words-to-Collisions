At t=0.9s, Obstacle 335 is in the same lanelet (10934) as the Ego vehicle and their positions are relatively close: Ego (-902.3943, -643.3602) and Obstacle 335 (-911.77363, -639.30559).  Obstacle 335 is ahead and slightly to the left of the Ego vehicle. Considering their respective velocities and accelerations, there is a high risk of collision in the immediate future. While Obstacle 329 is also relatively close, it's in a different lanelet and its slow speed and negative acceleration suggest it's not an immediate threat.  Obstacle 312 is far away and poses no risk.
