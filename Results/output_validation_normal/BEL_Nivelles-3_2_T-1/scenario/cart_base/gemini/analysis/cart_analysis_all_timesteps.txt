At t=0.9s, Ego is located at (-902.3943, -643.3602) in lanelet 10934.0.

Obstacle 335 is now in the same lanelet as Ego (10934.0) at position (-911.77363, -639.30559).  Given the proximity and differing velocities (Ego: 6.9209, Obstacle 335: 6.8608586), this represents an extreme risk of collision. Although the velocities are similar, the positions suggest they are converging. The small velocity difference, combined with the proximity and likely future trajectories based on past positions, means a collision is highly likely without immediate corrective action.

Obstacle 329 at (-887.63274, -655.0779) in lanelet 10912.0 and Obstacle 312 at (-881.52483, -658.05095) in lanelet 10962.0 do not pose an immediate threat.
