### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep (0.9 seconds):

### Obstacle Analysis:
1. **Obstacle ID: 312**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Located at (-881.52483, -658.05095), far from ego (-902.3943, -643.3602). Distance has been increasing over time.
   - **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: Very low velocity (0.3599846) and decelerating. No convergence with ego trajectory.
   - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)

2. **Obstacle ID: 329**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Located at (-887.63274, -655.0779), moving slowly away from ego. Distance has been stable/increasing.
   - **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: Low velocity (0.63409122) and decelerating. No immediate threat.
   - **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low Risk)

3. **Obstacle ID: 335**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Located at (-911.77363, -639.30559), in same lanelet as ego (10934.0). Distance is closing but still moderate (~9m).
   - **Distance safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: Velocity (6.8608586) is slightly lower than ego (6.9209) but accelerating. Relative velocity suggests potential convergence.
   - **Time safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 3 (Medium Risk)

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. No obstacles are in immediate collision course (no risk score 0).
2. Obstacle 335 is the closest threat but still at medium risk due to moderate distance and non-critical relative velocity.
3. Ego is decelerating overall (despite small recent acceleration), which helps mitigate risks.
4. Historical trajectories show no abrupt changes that would indicate imminent collision.
