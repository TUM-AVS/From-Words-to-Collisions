### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 312.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is far from ego vehicle and poses no immediate threat.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason:  The obstacle's slow speed and distance suggest no time-related risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 329.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is relatively far and not on a direct collision course.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason:  The obstacle's slow speed and trajectory suggest low risk over time.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- Obstacle ID: 331.0
- Distance Risk reason:  While the obstacle is somewhat distant, its trajectory warrants monitoring.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: The obstacle is moving at a moderate speed, but its trajectory doesn't indicate an immediate threat.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- Obstacle ID: 335.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is in the same lanelet as ego and relatively close.  The distance is decreasing over time, indicating potential risk.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: Although moving in the same general direction, the closing distance and relative speeds warrant attention and potential evasive actions.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3



### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
Based on the provided data, this is not a collision scenario. No obstacles are on a direct collision course with the ego vehicle within the predicted timeframe. While obstacle 335 warrants monitoring due to its proximity and closing distance, it does not represent an immediate collision risk.

### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
  "CollisionObstacles": [],
  "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null,
  "ScenarioAnalysis": {
    "IsCollisionScenario": false,
    "Reasoning": "No obstacle poses an immediate collision risk in the predicted timeframe, though obstacle 335 requires continued monitoring due to its proximity and closing distance."
  }
}
