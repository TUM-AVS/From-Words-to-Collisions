### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 312**
  - **Distance Risk Reason**: Despite proximity, consistent slow velocity and opposing direction indicate measures to move away.
  - **Distance Safety Score**: 4
  - **Time Risk Reason**: Slow velocity and minor decelerations; not significantly threatening.
  - **Time Safety Score**: 4
  - **Overall Risk Score**: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 329**
  - **Distance Risk Reason**: Relative distance maintained, slow speed, no converging path detected.
  - **Distance Safety Score**: 4
  - **Time Risk Reason**: Slow velocity and consistent deceleration, not approaching ego path.
  - **Time Safety Score**: 4
  - **Overall Risk Score**: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 331**
  - **Distance Risk Reason**: While moving relatively fast, it's maintaining or increasing distance from the ego vehicle.
  - **Distance Safety Score**: 5
  - **Time Risk Reason**: Moderate speed, acceleration upward; trajectory diverging.
  - **Time Safety Score**: 5
  - **Overall Risk Score**: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 335**
  - **Distance Risk Reason**: Shares lanelet with the ego, potentially converging paths in immediate proximity.
  - **Distance Safety Score**: 2
  - **Time Risk Reason**: Minimal lateral separation, velocity similar to ego and trajectory linearly aligning.
  - **Time Safety Score**: 2
  - **Overall Risk Score**: 2

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. **Obstacle 312**: Minimal risk due to slow movement and opposing path.
2. **Obstacle 329**: Minor risk, not interfering with ego's path.
3. **Obstacle 331**: Highest speed but trajectory indicating outward path; negligible risk.
4. **Obstacle 335**: Highest risk due to potential path convergence within the same lanelet.
