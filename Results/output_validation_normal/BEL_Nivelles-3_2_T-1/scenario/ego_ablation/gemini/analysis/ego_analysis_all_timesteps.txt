Obstacle 329 is approaching the ego vehicle longitudinally at a moderate speed (-6.36 m/s) and is relatively close (14.15 m).  While it is moving slightly away laterally, the longitudinal approach poses a medium-term risk. Obstacle 312 is further away (20.51 m) and approaching longitudinally at a similar speed (-7.27 m/s), but it's moving laterally away from the ego vehicle, presenting a lower risk currently. Obstacle 335 is behind the ego vehicle and moving away longitudinally, posing no immediate risk despite some lateral movement.  No obstacle presents an immediate collision risk in this timestep.
