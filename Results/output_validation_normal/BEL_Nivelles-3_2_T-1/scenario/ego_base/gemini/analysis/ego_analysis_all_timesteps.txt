At t=0.9s, Obstacle 312 is at longitudinal 20.51m and lateral 3.43m, moving towards the ego vehicle both longitudinally and laterally (from the left). Obstacle 329 is at longitudinal 14.15m and lateral 1.05m, also approaching the ego longitudinally and moving laterally away to the left.  Obstacle 335 is behind the ego vehicle at longitudinal -4.89m and lateral -2.41m, moving away longitudinally but approaching laterally (from the right). None of the obstacles are extremely close or on a direct collision course in this timestep. Although the lateral movement of obstacle 335 is concerning, the longitudinal distance suggests it is moving behind and away from the ego's path.

**Risk Levels and Definitions:**
<Collision (Score: 0)>: Actual collision has occurred or is unavoidable within the next timestep.
<Extreme Risk (Score: 1)>: Immediate collision or very high likelihood of impact. Urgent action is required.
<High Risk (Score: 2)>: Close to collision or highly probable collision path. Needs prompt attention and quick manoeuvring.
<Medium Risk (Score: 3)>: Moderate collision risk but manageable with timely reactions and proper strategies.
<Low Risk (Score: 4)>: Minimal collision risk. The situation is controllable with sufficient time to react.
<Negligible Risk (Score: 5)>: No significant collision risk. Obstacles are either moving away or far enough not to interfere.
