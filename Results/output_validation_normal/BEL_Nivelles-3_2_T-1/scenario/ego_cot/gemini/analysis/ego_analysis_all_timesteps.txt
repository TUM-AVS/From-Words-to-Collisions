### Safety analysis for timestep 0.9 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

**Assumptions and Clarifications:**

* **Missing Adjusted Distances:** The prompt emphasizes using *adjusted* distances (`adjusted_d_long`, `adjusted_d_lat`), but these values are not provided in the scenario context.  Therefore, the analysis will proceed using the provided `DTClong` and `DTClat` values, acknowledging that the results might not be entirely accurate without the adjusted values.  The absence of adjusted distances makes accurate TTC calculations impossible.
* **TTC Approximation:** Due to the lack of adjusted distances and the complex interplay of relative velocity and acceleration, precise TTC calculations are not feasible. The analysis will provide an *estimated* TTC based on current relative velocity and distance, assuming constant velocity.  This is a simplification.
* **Lateral Movement Complexity:** The lateral motion descriptions ("driving toward" or "moving away") are sometimes inconsistent with the signs of `Vrel_lat`. The analysis will prioritize the numerical values of `Vrel_lat` for assessment.

### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 312**
- Distance Risk reason: Located at 20.51m longitudinally and 20.51m laterally (front-left), presenting a currently safe distance.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Approaching the ego vehicle longitudinally (-7.27 m/s) but moving slightly leftward (-0.09 m/s).  TTC estimation is difficult without acceleration information and accurate distances, but seems moderate-low with lateral movement slightly mitigating risk.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3

- **Obstacle ID: 329**
- Distance Risk reason:  Closer than Obstacle 312 at 14.15m longitudinally and 14.15m laterally (front-left). This represents a greater potential risk.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason:  Approaching longitudinally (-6.36 m/s) and moving slightly leftward (0.30 m/s). The smaller longitudinal distance compared to Obstacle 312, and moderate approach speed suggests some risk.
- Time safety score: 2
- Overall Risk score: 2

- **Obstacle ID: 335**
- Distance Risk reason: Located behind (-4.89m long, -4.89 lat) and moving away longitudinally, posing no immediate risk.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Moving away longitudinally (-0.15 m/s), and although moving towards the ego laterally (1.08 m/s), its already behind and the lateral distance is not negligible.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4
