### Obstacle-by-Obstacle Analysis (Most Recent Timestep: 0.9s)

#### **Obstacle 312 (Front-left)**
- **Adjusted Position**: Longitudinal 20.51m, Lateral 3.43m  
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal -7.27 m/s (approaching), Lateral -0.09 m/s (moving left, away from ego)  
- **Motion**: Driving toward ego longitudinally but moving away laterally.  
- **TTC (Longitudinal)**: 20.51 / 7.27 ≈ 2.82s → **Medium Risk (3)**  
- **MDC (Lateral)**: 3.43m → **Low Risk (4)**  
- **Overall Risk**: Medium (3)  

#### **Obstacle 329 (Front-left)**
- **Adjusted Position**: Longitudinal 14.15m, Lateral 1.05m  
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal -6.36 m/s (approaching), Lateral 0.30 m/s (moving left, away from ego)  
- **Motion**: Driving toward ego longitudinally but moving away laterally.  
- **TTC (Longitudinal)**: 14.15 / 6.36 ≈ 2.23s → **Medium Risk (3)**  
- **MDC (Lateral)**: 1.05m → **Medium Risk (3)**  
- **Overall Risk**: Medium (3)  

#### **Obstacle 335 (Rear-right)**
- **Adjusted Position**: Longitudinal -4.89m (behind), Lateral -2.41m (right)  
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal -0.15 m/s (moving away), Lateral 1.08 m/s (approaching from right)  
- **Motion**: Moving away longitudinally but approaching laterally from right.  
- **TTC (Lateral)**: 2.41 / 1.08 ≈ 2.23s → **Medium Risk (3)**  
- **MDC (Longitudinal)**: 4.89m → **Low Risk (4)**  
- **Overall Risk**: Medium (3)

### Trajectory Analysis
- **Obstacle 312**: Consistently approaching longitudinally but lateral distance is increasing (low lateral risk).  
- **Obstacle 329**: Similar to 312 but with smaller longitudinal distance (still medium risk).  
- **Obstacle 335**: Moving away longitudinally but closing laterally (medium risk due to lateral proximity).  

### Critical Observations
- **No collisions (risk 0) or extreme risks (risk 1)** detected.  
- All obstacles have **medium or low risk** based on TTC/MDC.  
- Lateral movements for 312/329 are diverging, reducing collision likelihood.  
- Obstacle 335's lateral approach is slow (TTC > 2s).
