**Obstacle Analysis at Most Recent Timestep (0.9 seconds):**

### Obstacle 312
- **Position and Motion:**
  - Longitudinal Distance: 20.51 m
  - Lateral Distance: 3.43 m
  - Relative Velocity: Longitudinal -7.27 m/s, Lateral -0.09 m/s
  - Relative Acceleration: Longitudinal -0.06 m/s², Lateral 0.11 m/s²
  - Motion: Driving toward the ego car longitudinally and laterally from the left.

- **Trajectory Analysis:**
  - This obstacle is approaching the ego vehicle with a negative relative velocity indicating it is closing in on the ego vehicle both longitudinally and laterally.
  - The lateral distance is increasing slightly, indicating a slight divergence laterally.

- **Calculations:**
  - **TTC (Longitudinal)**: 20.51 m / 7.27 m/s ≈ 2.82 seconds
  - **TTC (Lateral)**: Not significant due to lateral divergence.
  - **MDC (Minimum Distance to Collision)**: Considering lateral divergence, MDC is now more longitudinal focused: 20.51 m

- **Risk Assessment:**
  - **TTC Longitudinal (2.82 seconds):** Medium Risk (3)
  - **MDC (20.51 m):** No Risk (5)

- **Final Risk Score for Obstacle 312:** Medium Risk (3)

### Obstacle 329
- **Position and Motion:**
  - Longitudinal Distance: 14.15 m
  - Lateral Distance: 1.05 m
  - Relative Velocity: Longitudinal -6.36 m/s, Lateral 0.30 m/s
  - Relative Acceleration: Longitudinal -0.46 m/s², Lateral 0.28 m/s²
  - Motion: Driving toward the ego car longitudinally and moving away laterally to the left.

- **Trajectory Analysis:**
  - The obstacle is approaching the ego vehicle with a longitudinal closing velocity and slight lateral divergence.
  - Relative lateral velocity suggests the obstacle is moving away laterally.

- **Calculations:**
  - **TTC (Longitudinal):** 14.15 m / 6.36 m/s ≈ 2.22 seconds
  - **TTC (Lateral):** Difficult to determine given lateral divergence.
  - **MDC:** Primarily longitudinal focus due to the trajectory: 14.15 m

- **Risk Assessment:**
  - **TTC Longitudinal (2.22 seconds):** Medium Risk (3)
  - **MDC (14.15 m):** No Risk (5)

- **Final Risk Score for Obstacle 329:** Medium Risk (3)

### Obstacle 335
- **Position and Motion:**
  - Longitudinal Distance: -4.89 m (Rear-right)
  - Lateral Distance: -2.41 m
  - Relative Velocity: Longitudinal -0.15 m/s, Lateral 1.08 m/s
  - Relative Acceleration: Longitudinal 0.09 m/s², Lateral -0.02 m/s²
  - Motion: Moving away longitudinally and driving toward the ego car laterally from the right.

- **Trajectory Analysis:**
  - The obstacle is slightly diverging longitudinally with no real risk of acceleration into the ego vehicle.
  - The lateral trajectory and velocity indicate the obstacle is rapidly moving laterally.

- **Calculations:**
  - **TTC (Longitudinal):** Not applicable due to moving away.
  - **TTC (Lateral):** Not significant due to lateral divergence.
  - **MDC:** Due to mutual diverging motion, significant collision risk is unlikely.

- **Risk Assessment:**
  - **Longitudinal TTC/Distance:** No Risk
  - **MDC:** No significant concern

- **Final Risk Score for Obstacle 335:** No Risk (5)
