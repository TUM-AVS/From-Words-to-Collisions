At t=0.9s, the ego vehicle is in lanelet 10925. Let's analyze the risk posed by each obstacle:

* **Obstacle 30:** Located in lanelet 10894, laterally separated and moving slowly.  Negligible risk.
* **Obstacle 31:** Located in lanelet 10078, stationary and far away. Negligible risk.
* **Obstacle 38:** Located in lanelet 10143, far away and moving slowly.  Negligible risk.
* **Obstacle 336:** In lanelet 10893, initially in lanelet 10926 alongside the ego vehicle, now slightly behind but accelerating faster than ego. Moderate risk due to lane change by Ego and obstacle's higher acceleration.
* **Obstacle 343:** Located in lanelet 10908, far away. Negligible risk.

The most important observation is the proximity and relative motion of Obstacle 336. While it's currently slightly behind the ego vehicle, its faster acceleration suggests it could pose a risk in the near future, especially given the ego vehicle's lane change. Although lanelet information implies a lane change by the ego vehicle, the provided data isn't sufficient to accurately determine TTC or MDC without more detailed lane geometry and future ego vehicle trajectory.
