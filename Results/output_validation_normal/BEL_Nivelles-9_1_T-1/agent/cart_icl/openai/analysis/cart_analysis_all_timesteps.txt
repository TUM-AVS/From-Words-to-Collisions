To assess the collision risk for the given scenario at the most recent timestep (0.9 seconds), let's evaluate the relative movement and risk for each obstacle with respect to the ego vehicle.

### Detailed Evaluation:

1. **Ego Vehicle:**
   - **Position**: (828.9702, -916.0055)
   - **Orientation**: 0.022 radians
   - **Velocity**: 8.8106 m/s
   - **Acceleration**: -0.3324 m/s²
   - **Lanelet**: 10925.0

2. **Obstacle 30:**
   - **Position**: (825.79799, -912.02713)
   - **Orientation**: -2.624 radians
   - **Velocity**: 0.0907 m/s
   - **Lanelet**: 10894.0
   - **Analysis**: Obstacle 30 is in a separate lanelet and moving very slowly compared to the ego vehicle. It's distant, with a low relative speed, indicating a low chance of interaction. **Risk**: Negligible (5)

3. **Obstacle 31:**
   - **Position**: (850.45458, -895.57075)
   - **Orientation**: -2.564 radians
   - **Velocity**: 0.0 m/s
   - **Lanelet**: 10078.0
   - **Analysis**: This obstacle is stationary and located far away from the path of the ego vehicle, posing no immediate risk. **Risk**: Negligible (5)

4. **Obstacle 38:**
   - **Position**: (845.27954, -927.15385)
   - **Orientation**: -4.223 radians
   - **Velocity**: 0.028 m/s
   - **Lanelet**: 10143.0
   - **Analysis**: Obstacle 38 is slowly moving and located significantly away from the ego's path. No significant collision course. **Risk**: Negligible (5)

5. **Obstacle 336:**
   - **Position**: (836.65866, -908.86721)
   - **Orientation**: 0.583 radians
   - **Velocity**: 11.0437 m/s
   - **Acceleration**: 1.53895 m/s²
   - **Lanelet**: 10893.0
   - **Analysis**: This obstacle is moving relatively fast and in the same general direction as the ego vehicle and in potentially overlapping lanelets. However, it's accelerating and moving away from the ego vehicle's trajectory, reducing the immediate collision threat slightly due to divergent paths. **Potential risk, but manageable with proper considerations.** **Risk**: Medium (3)

6. **Obstacle 343:**
   - **Position**: (808.87766, -927.07588)
   - **Orientation**: 0.580 radians
   - **Velocity**: 10.1305 m/s
   - **Lanelet**: 10908.0
   - **Analysis**: Obstacle 343 is moving with substantial velocity but is in a different lanelet, with a trajectory diverging from the ego vehicle. No immediate collision risk but requires monitoring. **Risk**: Low (4)

### Risk Summary:

- **CollisionObstacles**: No immediate collision risks identified based on current trajectories.
- **ExtremeRiskObstacles**: None.
- **HighRiskObstacles**: None identified.
- **MediumRiskObstacle**: Obstacle 336 has potential risk but considered manageable.
