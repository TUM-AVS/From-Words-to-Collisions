At t=0.9s, Obstacle 336 is the most critical obstacle. It's only 3.34m ahead longitudinally and moving away at a slow relative longitudinal velocity of 0.54 m/s, but there is a possibility that the ego vehicle might move forward. The lateral distance is 5.36 m and moving away at 5.87 m/s, but the lateral movement could still pose a risk.  All other obstacles are far enough to be categorized between low risk and no risk.
