At t=0.9s, Obstacle 336 is closest to the ego vehicle longitudinally at 3.34m, and laterally offset by 5.36m to the left, moving away longitudinally but laterally away to the left at 5.87 m/s. This represents a high risk due to the close longitudinal distance and rapid lateral movement. Obstacle 30 is aligned longitudinally (0.0m) and at 2.44m laterally to the left and closing laterally, therefore posing a medium risk. Obstacle 38 is at a safer longitudinal distance (11.55m) and moderate lateral distance (9.90m) to the right. Obstacle 31 is far away.  Obstacle 343 is moving away longitudinally and laterally to the right and presents a medium risk. Thus, obstacle 336 represents the highest risk.
