### Safety analysis for timestep 0.9s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

**- Obstacle ID: 30**
- Distance Risk reason:  Obstacle 30 is located directly to the left of the ego vehicle (0.0m lateral and longitudinal distance) at the most recent timestep. This indicates a collision.
- Distance safety score: 0
- Time Risk reason: The continuous decrease in distance over previous timesteps and 0 distance at the current timestep suggests a collision is unavoidable.
- Time safety score: 0
- Overall Risk score: 0

**- Obstacle ID: 31**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 31 is at a safe longitudinal and lateral distance (17.42m) from the ego vehicle and approaching longitudinally with a low relative velocity (-8.81 m/s).
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Given the current distance and relative velocity, there is ample time for the ego vehicle to react.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

**- Obstacle ID: 38**
- Distance Risk reason: The obstacle is located at a safe distance in the front-right (11.55m longitudinal and lateral) of the ego vehicle.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Although the obstacle is approaching the ego vehicle longitudinally, the current distance and relative velocity provide sufficient time to react. 
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

**- Obstacle ID: 336**
- Distance Risk reason: At 3.34m (longitudinal and lateral), Obstacle 336 is relatively close in the front-left of the ego car. It is moving away longitudinally, but the lateral motion warrants some attention.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: The obstacle is moving away longitudinally, increasing the time to collision. However, the decreasing lateral distance could become a concern if the trend continues.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

**- Obstacle ID: 343**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 343 is at a safe distance behind the ego vehicle (-15.82m longitudinal and lateral).
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason:  While the lateral movement of this obstacle is towards the ego vehicle, the longitudinal distance is increasing, suggesting a low risk of collision.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5
