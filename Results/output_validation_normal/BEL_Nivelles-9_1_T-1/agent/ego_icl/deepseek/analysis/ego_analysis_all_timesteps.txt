Let me analyze each obstacle at the most recent timestep (0.9 seconds) with trajectory context:

1. Obstacle 30 (Left):
   - Position: Exactly aligned longitudinally (0.00m), lateral distance 2.44m
   - Velocity: Approaching laterally at -0.04 m/s (very slow)
   - Trajectory: Has maintained left-side alignment with slowly decreasing lateral distance
   - MDC: 2.44m (lateral) - Medium Risk (3)
   - TTC: Not applicable (longitudinal alignment stable, lateral approach extremely slow)
   - Overall Risk: 3 (Medium) - No immediate threat but close proximity

2. Obstacle 31 (Front-left):
   - Position: Longitudinal 17.42m, lateral 18.35m
   - Velocity: Approaching longitudinally at -8.81 m/s
   - Trajectory: Newly appeared obstacle at safe distance
   - MDC: min(17.42, 18.35) = 17.42m - No Risk (5)
   - TTC: 17.42/8.81 = 1.98s - Medium Risk (3)
   - Overall Risk: 3 (Medium) - Approaching but at safe distance

3. Obstacle 38 (Front-right):
   - Position: Longitudinal 11.55m, lateral -9.90m
   - Velocity: Approaching longitudinally at -8.82 m/s, slight lateral movement
   - Trajectory: Maintaining front-right position with steady approach
   - MDC: min(11.55, 9.90) = 9.90m - No Risk (5)
   - TTC: 11.55/8.82 = 1.31s - Medium Risk (3)
   - Overall Risk: 3 (Medium) - Safe lateral distance

4. Obstacle 336 (Front-left):
   - Position: Longitudinal 3.34m, lateral 5.36m
   - Velocity: Moving away longitudinally (0.54 m/s) and laterally (5.87 m/s)
   - Trajectory: Clearly diverging path in both dimensions
   - MDC: min(3.34, 5.36) = 3.34m - Low Risk (4)
   - TTC: Not applicable (diverging)
   - Overall Risk: 4 (Low) - Moving away safely

5. Obstacle 343 (Rear-right):
   - Position: Longitudinal -15.82m, lateral -9.01m
   - Velocity: Moving away longitudinally (-0.22 m/s), approaching laterally (5.37 m/s)
   - Trajectory: Lateral movement is away from ego's path
   - MDC: min(15.82, 9.01) = 9.01m - No Risk (5)
   - TTC: Not applicable (lateral movement is crossing, not direct approach)
   - Overall Risk: 5 (Negligible) - No collision threat

JSON Summary:
{
    "CollisionObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": null,
        "OverallRiskScore": null
    },
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": null,
        "OverallRiskScore": null
    },
    "HighRiskObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": null,
        "OverallRiskScore": null
    }
}

Key Findings:
- No obstacles currently at Collision (0), Extreme Risk (1), or High Risk (2) levels
- Obstacle 30 presents the highest risk at Medium (3) due to close lateral proximity
- All other obstacles are at Medium (3) or lower risk levels
- The scenario shows no immediate collision threats at the current timestep
