Obstacle 30:

- Trajectory: Consistently to the ego vehicle's left, maintaining near-zero longitudinal distance. Lateral distance slightly fluctuating but remaining around 2.44m.
- TTC: Not applicable longitudinally as there is exact alignment. Laterally, relative velocity is near zero, so TTC is very high, indicating no immediate lateral risk.
- MDC: Approximately 2.44m laterally.
- Risk: 4 (Low Risk) due to consistent lateral separation, despite longitudinal alignment.

Obstacle 31:

- Trajectory: Approaching from the front-left. Both longitudinal and lateral distances are large but decreasing.
- TTC: Longitudinal TTC = 17.42m / 8.81m/s ≈ 1.98s. Lateral TTC is not calculable due to zero relative lateral velocity.
- MDC: With the current trajectory and large distances, MDC is difficult to precisely estimate but is >5m.
- Risk: 4 (Low Risk) due to the relatively large distance and TTC > 1s.

Obstacle 38:

- Trajectory: Approaching from the front-right, with both distances decreasing over time.
- TTC: Longitudinal TTC = 11.55m / 8.82m/s ≈ 1.31s. Lateral TTC is very high due to near-zero lateral velocity.
- MDC: With the current trajectory and moderately decreasing distance, MDC is greater than 3m and less than 5m.
- Risk: 4 (Low Risk) due to TTC > 1s and MDC > 3m.

Obstacle 336:

- Trajectory: Moving away from the front-left. Initially, it was directly in front, but has since moved laterally to the left and away from the ego vehicle. Both distances are increasing.
- TTC: Not applicable as the obstacle is moving away.
- MDC: Based on trajectory and increasing distances, MDC is >5m.
- Risk: 5 (Negligible Risk) due to diverging trajectory and increasing distance.

Obstacle 343:

- Trajectory: Moving away longitudinally from behind, while laterally approaching from the right. Longitudinal distance increasing.
- TTC:  Not applicable longitudinally as the obstacle is moving away. Lateral TTC = 9.01 / 5.37 ≈ 1.68s.
- MDC: Based on the trajectory and distance data, MDC is > 5m. 
- Risk: 4 (Low Risk) due to increasing longitudinal separation and moderate lateral approach.
