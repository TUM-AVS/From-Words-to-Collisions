Let's begin a detailed analysis for the most recent timestep at 0.9 seconds. We will focus on adjusted distances and examine obstacle trajectories across timesteps. The analysis will include TTC, MDC, and risk level assessments based on outlined principles and motion descriptions.

### Obstacle-by-Obstacle Analysis:

#### Obstacle 30:
- **Position and Movement**: Primarily Left of ego vehicle. Longitudinal alignment at 0.00m indicates co-motion, while lateral distance is 2.44m.
- **Velocities**: Longitudinal velocity is -8.89 m/s (approaching ego laterally), and lateral velocity is -0.04 m/s.
- **Trajectory**: Approaching mostly inline longitudinally, but due to non-zero lateral width staying clear.
- **TTC Calculation**: Lateral direction needed as longitudinal is alignment. 
  - **TTC (lateral)**: 2.44 m / 0.04 m/s = 61s (inapplicable due to diverging path)
- **MDC**: With longitudinal alignment and non-zero lateral, MDC primarily on lateral trajectory: 2.44m
- **Risk Assessment**: Based on lateral proximity and velocity, and observing stabilization: **Negligible Risk (5)**.

#### Obstacle 31:
- **Position and Movement**: Front-left. Longitudinally 17.42m, laterally 18.35m.
- **Velocities**: Negative longitudinal velocity -8.81 m/s.
- **Trajectory**: Moving directly towards the ego longitudinally.
- **TTC Calculation**:
  - **TTC (longitudinal)**: 17.42 m / 8.81 m/s = 1.98s (converging)
- **MDC**: Beyond 5.0 meters, as lateral alignment diverges significantly.
- **Risk Assessment**: Longitudinal convergence suggests possibility, but distance and time provide margin: **Medium Risk (3)**.

#### Obstacle 38:
- **Position and Movement**: Front-right. Longitudinally 11.55m and laterally -9.90m.
- **Velocities**: Longitudinally -8.82 m/s (approaching), slight lateral velocity 0.03 m/s.
- **Trajectory**: Driving mostly longitudinally towards ego, slight lateral approach.
- **TTC Calculation**:
  - **TTC (longitudinal)**: 11.55 m / 8.82 m/s = 1.31s
- **MDC**: Driven primarily by converging paths: 1.31s indicates minimum trajectory concern.
- **Risk Assessment**: Despite good front clearance, converging paths indicate a need for caution: **Medium Risk (3)**.

#### Obstacle 336:
- **Position and Movement**: Front-left. Longitudinally 3.34m, laterally 5.36m, moving away.
- **Velocities**: Positive velocities indicate movement away: Longitudinally 0.54 m/s, laterally 5.87 m/s.
- **Trajectory**: Separation in both longitudinal and lateral dimensions.
- **TTC Calculation**: 
  - **Longitudinal**: Not critical due to moving away
- **MDC**: Front needs confirmation by overlap: sufficient clearance, moving away.
- **Risk Assessment**: Due to moving away: **Negligible Risk (5)**.

#### Obstacle 343:
- **Position and Movement**: Rear-right. Longitudinal -15.82m, lateral -9.01m. Moving laterally.
- **Velocities**: Longitudinally -0.22 m/s (away/parallel), lateral positive.
- **Trajectory**: Moving laterally towards with some subsequent spacing.
- **TTC Calculation**: Lateral approach, but high separation.
- **MDC**: Requires extensive lateral trajectory: sufficient clearance underway.
- **Risk Assessment**: Longitudinal clearance and minor practical convergence: **Negligible Risk (5)**.

### Conclusion and JSON Summary:

In summary, none of the obstacles represent a collision risk. Obstacle 31 and 38 present medium risk due to their comparative proximity and convergence trajectory. Obstacle 30 is negligible due to its lateral trajectory and alignment.

(Note: JSON format has a class for "MediumRiskObstacle" to match the specific request pattern)

Each assessment carefully considers directions of travel and motion descriptors to reasonably infer proximity and potential for collision based on metrics well-supported by the current situation.
