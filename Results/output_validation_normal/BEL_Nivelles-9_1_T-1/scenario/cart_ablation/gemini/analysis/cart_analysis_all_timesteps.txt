At t=0.9s, Ego is in lanelet 10925.0 and moving with a velocity of 8.81 m/s.

Obstacle 336 is now in lanelet 10893.0, and its velocity has increased to 11.04 m/s.  Obstacle 336 poses a high risk. It's trajectory and increasing velocity suggest a possible lane change into the Ego vehicle's path. More information about lanelet connections and intended trajectories would be needed to confirm, but the current data suggests an extreme risk of collision.

  "ScenarioAnalysis": {
    "IsCollisionScenario": false,
    "Reasoning": "Obstacle 336 shows an extreme risk due to its trajectory, increasing velocity, and proximity to the Ego vehicle after a potential lane change. While not a certain collision, the risk is high enough to warrant an extreme risk score."
