At t=0.9s, Ego is in lanelet 10925.0 and moving with a velocity of 8.81 m/s.

Obstacle 336 is in lanelet 10893.0 and moving with a velocity of 11.04 m/s. While the lanelets might be close,  the provided data doesn't give us enough information about the lanelet geometry or their relative positions to determine a collision risk. Further, obstacle 336 is accelerating quite strongly. We need more context about road geometry and lane connectivity to assess true risk.  Without more information, we can only categorize this as a potential risk but not definitively extreme or collision.

Obstacle 343 is in lanelet 10908.0 and moving with a velocity of 10.13 m/s. Similar to the case with obstacle 336, without lanelet geometry and connectivity information, it's impossible to make a definitive judgment on collision risk.
