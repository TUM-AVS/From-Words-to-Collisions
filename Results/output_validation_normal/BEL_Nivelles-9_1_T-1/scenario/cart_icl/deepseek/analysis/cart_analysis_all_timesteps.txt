### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep (0.9 seconds):

### Obstacle Analysis:
1. **Obstacle ID: 30.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Positioned at (825.79799, -912.02713), moving slowly away from ego (828.9702, -916.0055). Distance is increasing over time.
   - **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: Very low velocity (0.0907) and decelerating. No collision trajectory.
   - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 5

2. **Obstacle ID: 31.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Static at (850.45458, -895.57075), far from ego's trajectory.
   - **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: Zero velocity and acceleration.
   - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 5

3. **Obstacle ID: 38.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Positioned at (845.27954, -927.15385), moving very slowly and laterally away from ego.
   - **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: Low velocity (0.0283) and minor acceleration.
   - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 5

4. **Obstacle ID: 336.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: At (836.65866, -908.86721), moving parallel to ego but with increasing distance (lateral separation ~7.1m).
   - **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: High velocity (11.0437) but diverging trajectory. Relative velocity suggests no convergence.
   - **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 4

5. **Obstacle ID: 343.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: At (808.87766, -927.07588), moving opposite to ego but with significant longitudinal separation (~20m).
   - **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: High velocity (10.1305) but opposing direction. No immediate collision path.
   - **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 4

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. No obstacles are in direct collision path with ego at current timestep.
2. All obstacles are either moving away, static, or have diverging trajectories.
3. Closest dynamic obstacle (336.0) is laterally separated and accelerating away.
4. No abrupt changes in acceleration or direction observed in any obstacle.
