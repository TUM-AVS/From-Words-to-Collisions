### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 30
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 30 is laterally separated from the ego vehicle and its slow velocity suggests minimal risk.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason:  The slow velocity and acceleration suggest minimal risk of collision over time.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- Obstacle ID: 31
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 31 is far from the ego vehicle and stationary, posing no immediate threat.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason:  Being stationary further reduces any time-related risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 38
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 38 is laterally separated and moving slowly, presenting minimal risk.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: The slow velocity and decreasing acceleration contribute to low time-based risk.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- Obstacle ID: 321
- Distance Risk reason: Similar to Obstacle 31, this one is also far and practically stationary.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Negligible velocity and acceleration.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 327
- Distance Risk reason: Far from the ego vehicle and stationary.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Stationary, presenting no time-dependent risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 332
- Distance Risk reason:  Far and stationary, posing no immediate danger.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Stationary, eliminating time-related risks.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 335
- Distance Risk reason:  Laterally separated and moving in a parallel direction to the ego vehicle, but at a safe distance.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: The parallel movement with similar velocities suggests a stable situation for the near future.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- Obstacle ID: 336
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 336 is in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle and relatively close, increasing the risk.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: Although moving in the same direction, the proximity and speed difference warrant attention.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3

- Obstacle ID: 343
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 343 is behind the ego vehicle but in the same lane.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Its velocity is slightly higher than the ego vehicle's, deserving consideration.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4


### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
The ego vehicle is changing lanes and obstacle 336 is close and moving at a higher speed. The ego vehicle needs to consider the presence of 336 before completing the lane change. No immediate collision is detected, but the situation requires attention. This is not a collision scenario.

### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
  "CollisionObstacles": [],
  "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null,
  "ScenarioAnalysis": {
    "IsCollisionScenario": false,
    "Reasoning": "No obstacle poses an immediate collision risk at the most recent timestep, but obstacle 336 requires close monitoring due to proximity and speed difference during the ego vehicle's lane change."
  }
}
```
