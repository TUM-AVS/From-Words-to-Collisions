### Obstacle Analysis:

#### Obstacle ID: 30
- **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is fairly close to the ego vehicle but maintains a nearly constant and minimal velocity, moving slightly away. Intersection of paths is unlikely.
- **Distance safety score**: 4
- **Time Risk reason**: Given the low velocity and deceleration, its potential to alter trajectory in a way that risks collision is minimal.
- **Time safety score**: 4
- **Overall Risk score**: 4

#### Obstacle ID: 31
- **Distance Risk reason**: This obstacle has remained stationary throughout. It is not in a direct collision path.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: No velocity change; thus, no risk of collision.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 38
- **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is almost stationary and located well away from the ego vehicle's trajectory.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: The obstacle is showing a minor backward movement with very low velocity, contributing no collision threat.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 321
- **Distance Risk reason**: It is stationary and far from the ego vehicle's current path.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: No observed velocity change.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 327
- **Distance Risk reason**: Stationary and far from the ego's trajectory.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: No movement throughout, maintaining safety.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 332
- **Distance Risk reason**: Unchanging and distant from ego path.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: No fluctuation in speed; thus, no collision threat.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 335
- **Distance Risk reason**: Moving parallel but is not converging to ego path, indicating low risk.
- **Distance safety score**: 4
- **Time Risk reason**: While it's moving with some acceleration, its direction doesn't suggest an intersection with the ego's path.
- **Time safety score**: 4
- **Overall Risk score**: 4

#### Obstacle ID: 336
- **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is moving in the same general direction as the ego vehicle but is ahead and accelerating away.
- **Distance safety score**: 4
- **Time Risk reason**: Its trajectory shows a constant velocity slightly higher than ego's, moving ahead and away.
- **Time safety score**: 4
- **Overall Risk score**: 4

#### Obstacle ID: 343
- **Distance Risk reason**: Moving away relative to the ego path, decreasing collision likelihood.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: High, consistent velocity maintaining a safe buffer.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
- The evaluation reveals no obstacles in a direct path posing immediate collision risk (no risk score of 0).
- Obstacles observed are either stationary or moving in a manner that maintains or increases the separation from the ego vehicle.
- All obstacles have maintained behavior that keeps them away from critical areas likely to result in a collision.
