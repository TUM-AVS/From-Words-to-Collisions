Obstacle 30 is laterally very close to the ego vehicle (2.44 m) and although it has no longitudinal relative velocity, it is considered a high risk due to its lateral movement towards the ego vehicle. Obstacle 31, while longitudinally distant (17.42 m), is approaching the ego vehicle at a high longitudinal relative velocity (-8.81 m/s) and needs to be monitored closely. Obstacle 38, though further away than Obstacle 31 (11.55 m longitudinally), also exhibits a high longitudinal relative velocity (-8.82 m/s) towards the ego vehicle and merits attention.  Obstacle 336 and 343 are moving away from the ego vehicle longitudinally and do not represent immediate risks.

        "Reasoning": "Obstacle 30 poses an extreme risk due to its close lateral proximity (2.44m) and lateral movement towards the ego vehicle. While other obstacles (31, 38) are approaching at high speeds, they are not currently posing an extreme risk due to their greater longitudinal distances."
