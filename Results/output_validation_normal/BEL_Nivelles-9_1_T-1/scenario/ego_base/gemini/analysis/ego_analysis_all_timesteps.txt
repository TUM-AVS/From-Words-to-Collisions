Obstacle 336 is the closest obstacle longitudinally (3.34m) and moving away from the ego vehicle. However, it's lateral distance is increasing rapidly (5.87 m/s), suggesting it might not be a direct threat.

Obstacle 30 and 31 are both to the left and front-left of the ego vehicle.  Obstacle 30 has a longitudinal distance of 0.0m which implies it is alongside the ego vehicle and has little risk of collision provided the vehicles continue on their course. Obstacle 31 is much farther away longitudinally (17.42 m) and moving towards the ego vehicle but does not pose an immediate threat.

Obstacle 38 is to the front-right (11.55m) and approaching longitudinally, but its lateral motion suggests it's moving away from a potential collision path. It poses less risk than obstacle 336 due to the larger longitudinal distance.

Obstacle 343 is behind and to the right of the ego vehicle. Its longitudinal distance is decreasing and lateral motion is rapid, moving towards the ego vehicle. Although it is approaching quickly in the lateral direction, it is still a significant distance away (-15.82m longitudinally and -9.01m laterally). It does not pose an immediate threat.

Therefore, at this time step there are no obstacles posing an extreme or collision risk.
