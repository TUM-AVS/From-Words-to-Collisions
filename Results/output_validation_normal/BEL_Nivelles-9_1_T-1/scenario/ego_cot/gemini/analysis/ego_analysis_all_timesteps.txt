### Safety analysis for timestep 0.9 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

**Assumptions and Clarifications:**

* Since adjusted distances (adjusted_d_long, adjusted_d_lat) are not provided, raw distance values (DTClong, DTClat) will be used as approximations for this analysis.  This may lead to less precise risk assessments.
* TTC calculations will be simplified due to the lack of consistent acceleration data and for demonstrative purposes.  A more robust analysis would typically involve continuous integration of motion equations.
* A collision is assumed when DTClong and DTClat are both approximately zero, indicating a direct overlap with the ego vehicle's position.

### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 30**
- Distance Risk reason: Located directly to the left of the ego vehicle (DTClong: 0.0m, DTClat: 0.0m). This signifies a likely lateral collision.
- Distance safety score: 0
- Time Risk reason:  Given the current position and continuous lateral movement towards the ego vehicle, a near-instantaneous collision is highly probable.
- Time safety score: 0
- Overall Risk score: 0

- **Obstacle ID: 31**
- Distance Risk reason:  Located far ahead and to the left (DTClong: 17.42m, DTClat: 17.42m), posing no immediate threat.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Although approaching longitudinally (Vrel_long: -8.81 m/s), the substantial distance provides ample time to react.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 38**
- Distance Risk reason: Located diagonally ahead and to the right at a moderate distance (DTClong: 11.55m, DTClat: 11.55m), presenting a potential but not imminent risk.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: The longitudinal approach (Vrel_long: -8.82 m/s) warrants attention, but the distance suggests some time to maneuver.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3

- **Obstacle ID: 336**
- Distance Risk reason: Located relatively close and diagonally ahead to the left (DTClong: 3.34m, DTClat: 3.34m).
- Distance safety score: 2
- Time Risk reason: Although moving away longitudinally (Vrel_long: 0.54 m/s), the lateral movement towards the ego vehicle still poses potential risk and should be addressed.
- Time safety score: 2
- Overall Risk score: 2

- **Obstacle ID: 343**
- Distance Risk reason: Located behind and to the right (DTClong: -15.82m, DTClat: -15.82m), no immediate danger.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason:  While there's significant lateral movement towards the ego vehicle (Vrel_lat: 5.37 m/s), its current rearward position suggests no immediate collision risk.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

  },
  "IsCollisionScenario": true,
  "Justification": "Obstacle 30 exhibits a direct lateral overlap with the ego vehicle (DTClong and DTClat both at 0.0m), indicating a collision at timestep 0.9 seconds. Although there is not an extreme risk (risk score 1), since there is a collision in this timestep, IsCollisionScenario is true."
