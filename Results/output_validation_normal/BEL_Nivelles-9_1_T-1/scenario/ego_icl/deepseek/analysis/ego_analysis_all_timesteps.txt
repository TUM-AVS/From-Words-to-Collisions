Let me analyze the most recent timestep (0.9 seconds) for each obstacle:

1. Obstacle 30 (Left):
   - Adjusted distance: longitudinal 0.00m, lateral 2.44m
   - Relative velocity: longitudinal -8.89 m/s (approaching), lateral -0.04 m/s (approaching)
   - Motion: Exact longitudinal alignment, approaching laterally from left
   - MDC (lateral): 2.44m (Medium Risk)
   - TTC (longitudinal): 0.00s (Collision Risk 0) - since already aligned longitudinally
   - Overall Risk: 0 (Collision) due to exact longitudinal alignment with lateral closing

2. Obstacle 31 (Front-left):
   - Adjusted distance: longitudinal 17.42m, lateral 18.35m
   - Relative velocity: longitudinal -8.81 m/s (approaching), lateral 0.00 m/s
   - Motion: Approaching longitudinally, no lateral motion
   - MDC: 17.42m (No Risk)
   - TTC: 17.42/8.81 = 1.98s (Medium Risk)
   - Overall Risk: 3 (Medium)

3. Obstacle 38 (Front-right):
   - Adjusted distance: longitudinal 11.55m, lateral -9.90m
   - Relative velocity: longitudinal -8.82 m/s (approaching), lateral 0.03 m/s (approaching)
   - Motion: Approaching from front-right
   - MDC: 9.90m (No Risk)
   - TTC: 11.55/8.82 = 1.31s (Medium Risk)
   - Overall Risk: 3 (Medium)

4. Obstacle 336 (Front-left):
   - Adjusted distance: longitudinal 3.34m, lateral 5.36m
   - Relative velocity: longitudinal 0.54 m/s (moving away), lateral 5.87 m/s (moving away)
   - Motion: Moving away in both dimensions
   - MDC: 3.34m (Low Risk)
   - TTC: N/A (diverging paths)
   - Overall Risk: 4 (Low)

5. Obstacle 343 (Rear-right):
   - Adjusted distance: longitudinal -15.82m, lateral -9.01m
   - Relative velocity: longitudinal -0.22 m/s (moving away), lateral 5.37 m/s (approaching)
   - Motion: Moving away longitudinally, approaching laterally
   - MDC: 9.01m (No Risk)
   - TTC: N/A (diverging paths)
   - Overall Risk: 5 (No Risk)

Trajectory Analysis:
- Obstacle 30 is the critical case - it maintains exact longitudinal alignment (0.00m) while closing laterally (2.44m distance with -0.04 m/s velocity)
- All other obstacles are either moving away or at safe distances
- The exact longitudinal alignment with any lateral closing motion creates a collision risk

    "Justification": "Obstacle 30 has exact longitudinal alignment (0.00m) with the ego vehicle while closing laterally (2.44m distance with -0.04 m/s velocity), constituting a collision scenario"
