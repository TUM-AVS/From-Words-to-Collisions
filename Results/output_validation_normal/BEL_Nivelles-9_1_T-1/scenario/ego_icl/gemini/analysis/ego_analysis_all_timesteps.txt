* **Obstacle 30:** This obstacle is consistently to the left of the ego vehicle and maintains near-zero longitudinal distance throughout the scenario.  Lateral distance fluctuates slightly but remains above 2 meters. With consistent longitudinal alignment, a collision is unlikely. At the last timestep, lateral distance is 2.44m, and there's no longitudinal movement towards the ego vehicle, indicating no immediate risk.  The consistent lateral distance > 2m suggests no collision risk.  Risk score: 5 (No Risk)

* **Obstacle 31:** This obstacle appears only at the last timestep (0.9s) at a longitudinal distance of 17.42m and a lateral distance of 18.35m. Given its distance and the fact there is no lateral relative motion from a safe frontal distance, there is no immediate risk. Risk score: 5 (No Risk)

* **Obstacle 38:** This obstacle is approaching the ego vehicle from the front-right, with both longitudinal and lateral distances decreasing over time. However, at the last timestep, the longitudinal distance is 11.55m and the lateral distance is -9.90m, suggesting no immediate collision risk. Considering the closing velocity and distance, this obstacle requires monitoring. TTC_longitudinal = 11.55m / 8.82 m/s ≈ 1.3s. TTC_lateral = 9.90m / 0.03m/s ≈ 330s. Risk score: 4 (Low Risk)

* **Obstacle 336:** This obstacle is initially in front of the ego vehicle and moves further away longitudinally over time. Lateral movement increases to the left.  At the last timestep (0.9s) it's 3.34m in front and 5.36m to the left of the ego, clearly moving away, showing no collision risk. Risk score: 5 (No Risk)

* **Obstacle 343:** This obstacle is initially behind the ego vehicle and approaches over time. While lateral movement varies, the longitudinal distance remains significant at 15.82m behind at 0.9 seconds. Furthermore, it shows it starts to move away longitudinally at the last time step (-0.22m/s). Despite the fluctuating lateral distances, the large longitudinal separation suggests no imminent collision risk. Risk score: 5 (No Risk)

**Collision Scenario Determination:** No obstacle has a risk score of 0 or 1. Therefore, this is NOT a collision scenario.
