Obstacles 30 and 37 are in lanelet 8565, which seems spatially separated from ego vehicle's lanelet 8031.  Obstacles 317 and 320 are in lanelet 8028, which is likely adjacent to the ego vehicle's lanelet 8031.

Obstacle 317 shows a concerning trend. It is relatively close to the ego vehicle and its velocity is increasing while the ego vehicle is decelerating. This increases the chances of a collision if obstacle 317 continues on its current trajectory. Obstacle 320 is also in the same lanelet as 317 and relatively close to the ego vehicle, but its behavior is less concerning as its velocity changes are minimal.

Based on the provided data, no collisions are imminent, but obstacle 317 poses a high risk.  There's a good chance the ego vehicle and obstacle 317 will come very close to each other, so continued monitoring and potential evasive action by the ego vehicle may become necessary.
