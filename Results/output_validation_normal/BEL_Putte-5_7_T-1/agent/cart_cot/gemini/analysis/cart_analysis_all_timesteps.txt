At t=0.9s, the ego vehicle is at (-645.3436, -355.1442) and moving with a velocity of 2.0362 and a small deceleration. Let's analyze the risk posed by each obstacle:

* **Obstacle 30:** Position (-649.55687, -348.37782), velocity 2.689734. This obstacle is somewhat behind and to the left of the ego vehicle and moving faster.  The lateral separation is relatively significant, but the longitudinal distance is decreasing. There is no immediate danger of collision, but warrants monitoring. I classify it as a *Medium Risk (3)*.

* **Obstacle 37:** Position (-641.41797, -342.06949), velocity 0.83030222. This obstacle is ahead and to the right of the ego vehicle and moving much slower. Given the current trajectories and speeds, a collision is very unlikely. I classify it as a *Negligible Risk (5)*.

* **Obstacle 317:** Position (-644.78558, -368.95284), velocity 3.5311325. This obstacle is slightly behind and significantly to the left of the ego vehicle, but moving considerably faster. This poses a higher risk because it is closing the distance rapidly from the side.  A collision is possible if the ego vehicle maintains its current trajectory and velocity. This is classified as *High Risk (2)*.

* **Obstacle 320:** Position (-651.01468, -378.87314), velocity 1.1562384.  This obstacle is behind and significantly to the left of the ego vehicle. While it is moving slower, the lateral distance is a concern if both maintain their course. I classify this as a *Medium Risk (3)*.
