At t=0.9s, the ego vehicle is in lanelet 8031.0. Let's analyze the risk posed by each obstacle:

* **Obstacle 30:** Located in lanelet 8565.0, this obstacle poses no immediate risk to the ego vehicle.  Although the obstacle is accelerating and moving with a higher velocity than the ego vehicle, the lateral separation suggests they are in different lanes and the trajectories are diverging. Risk: **Negligible (5)**

* **Obstacle 37:** Similar to Obstacle 30, this obstacle is also in lanelet 8565.0 and exhibits a diverging trajectory from the ego vehicle. The low velocity and acceleration further diminish any potential risk. Risk: **Negligible (5)**

* **Obstacle 317:** This obstacle is in lanelet 8028.0 and moving with a relatively high velocity and acceleration.  It's crucial to determine the relative positions and headings more precisely to accurately assess collision risk.  Without more context on lanelet geometry and relative headings, it's difficult to give a precise score, but it warrants attention due to proximity and high velocity. Preliminary Risk: **Medium (3)** - Pending further lanelet information.

* **Obstacle 320:** Also in lanelet 8028.0, this obstacle is relatively close to the ego vehicle and accelerating. Similar to Obstacle 317, a precise risk assessment requires more information about lane geometry and relative headings. Preliminary Risk: **Medium (3)** - Pending further lanelet information.

Since none of the obstacles pose an immediate or extreme risk based on the provided information, the JSON output will reflect scores of 3 or higher for all obstacles.  We will assume a score of 3 for obstacles 317 and 320 due to the need for further investigation.  Obstacles 30 and 37 are assigned a risk score of 5.
