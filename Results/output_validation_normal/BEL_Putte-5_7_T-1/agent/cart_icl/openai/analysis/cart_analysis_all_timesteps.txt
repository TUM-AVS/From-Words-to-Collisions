To analyze the scenario, I'll focus on positions, velocities, and accelerations provided in the most recent timestep at 0.9 seconds. We'll assess the TTC and MDC for each obstacle relative to the ego vehicle's movement and location.

### Analysis

#### Ego Vehicle Position at 0.9s:
- Position: (-645.3436, -355.1442)
- Velocity: 2.0362 m/s
- Orientation: 1.918 radians

#### Obstacle 30
- Position: (-649.55687, -348.37782)
- Velocity: 2.689734 m/s
- Orientation: -2.2257 radians
- **Relative Position**: Approximately 7.4 meters away along a vector from the ego's current position.
- **Risk**: Moderate velocity difference and significant distance. No immediate collision risk, so low risk.

#### Obstacle 37
- Position: (-641.41797, -342.06949)
- Velocity: 0.83030222 m/s
- Orientation: -2.5521 radians
- **Relative Position**: Roughly 13 meters away with slower velocity.
- **Risk**: Safe lateral and longitudinal distance. Minimal risk, negligible risk.

#### Obstacle 317
- Position: (-644.78558, -368.95284)
- Velocity: 3.5311325 m/s
- Orientation: -5.1378 radians
- **Relative Position**: Approximately 14 meters behind along the ego's travelling direction.
- **Risk**: Moving at a significantly higher speed in a different lane. No immediate threat due to difference in lanelets and same-direction approach. Negligible risk.

#### Obstacle 320
- Position: (-651.01468, -378.87314)
- Velocity: 1.1562384 m/s
- Orientation: -5.3877 radians
- **Relative Position**: More than 25 meters away, in a lane behind the ego vehicle.
- **Risk**: Very safe distance, negligible risk given different lanelet and orientation.

### Summary
No obstacles present a risk of collision given the current trajectories. All obstacles maintain sufficient separation from the ego vehicle, and those in different lanelets do not present any immediate threat.
