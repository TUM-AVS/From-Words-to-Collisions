At t=0.9s, Obstacle 30 is the most critical obstacle. It is located directly ahead of the ego vehicle at a longitudinal distance of 3.29 meters, closing at a relative longitudinal speed of -3.48 m/s.  While it has a slight lateral velocity to the left (0.05 m and 2.27 m/s), the primary concern is the impending longitudinal collision given the closing distance and velocity.

Obstacle 37, at a longitudinal distance of 6.45m and lateral distance of -6.53m with closing speeds of -2.24 m/s and 0.81 m/s respectively, appears less concerning than obstacle 30 in the immediate timeframe (next second or two) even though it is moving both longitudinally and laterally towards the ego vehicle.

Obstacles 317 and 320 are behind the ego vehicle and do not pose immediate collision risks.

Given Obstacle 30's close proximity and high closing speed, it represents an extreme risk.
