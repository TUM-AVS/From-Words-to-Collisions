Obstacle 30 is in the Front-left and is closest to the ego vehicle at 3.29m longitudinal distance.  It's approaching the ego vehicle longitudinally at -3.48 m/s. Although it's slightly moving to the left, the lateral distance is only 0.05m and the movement is minimal (-0.30 m/sÂ² acceleration). This represents a very high risk of collision.

Obstacle 37 is further away at 6.45m longitudinally and -6.53m laterally. While it is moving closer longitudinally (-2.24 m/s), it's also moving laterally towards the ego vehicle at 0.81 m/s. The lateral movement needs monitoring but the longitudinal distance provides some buffer.  It's a medium risk currently.

Obstacles 317 and 320 are behind the ego vehicle and moving away longitudinally, posing no immediate threat.  They are classified as low risk.
