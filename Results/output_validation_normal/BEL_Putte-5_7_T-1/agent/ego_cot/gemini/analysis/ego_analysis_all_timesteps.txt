### Safety analysis for timestep 0.9 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 30**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 30 is in the Front-left of the ego vehicle at a diagonal distance of 3.29m.  This close proximity represents a significant collision risk.
- Distance safety score: 2
- Time Risk reason: The closing longitudinal velocity suggests a likely collision if the current trajectories continue.
- Time safety score: 2
- Overall Risk score: 2

- **Obstacle ID: 37**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 37 is located in the Front-right with a diagonal distance of 6.45m. While not immediately critical, this still presents a potential hazard.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: The closing longitudinal velocity poses a medium risk, requiring attention and potential evasive action.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3


- **Obstacle ID: 317**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 317 is in the Rear-left and moving away longitudinally while the lateral distance is -8.67m, and the lateral relative speed is negative. It represents a minimal risk of collision.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Due to a safe longitudinal distance and receding motion, the TTC value is not relevant in assessing collision risk, and based on the lateral relative speed and distance, there is minimal risk of collision.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 320**
- Distance Risk reason: Located in the Rear-left and moving away longitudinally with a significant lateral distance of -15.87m. This poses negligible collision risk.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Considering the large distance and the direction of motion, no risk of collision is foreseen.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5
