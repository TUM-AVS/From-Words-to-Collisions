Let me analyze each obstacle at the most recent timestep (0.9 seconds):

1. Obstacle 30 (Front-left):
- Adjusted distances: longitudinal 3.29m, lateral 0.05m
- Relative velocity: longitudinal -3.48 m/s (approaching), lateral 2.27 m/s (moving away)
- TTC longitudinal: 3.29/3.48 = 0.95s (High Risk)
- TTC lateral: Not applicable (moving away)
- MDC: 3.29m (primary concern is longitudinal)
- Risk: High (2) due to rapidly closing longitudinal distance

2. Obstacle 37 (Front-right):
- Adjusted distances: longitudinal 6.45m, lateral -6.53m
- Relative velocity: longitudinal -2.24 m/s (approaching), lateral 0.81 m/s (approaching)
- TTC longitudinal: 6.45/2.24 = 2.88s (Medium Risk)
- TTC lateral: 6.53/0.81 = 8.06s (No Risk)
- MDC: 6.45m (longitudinal) and 6.53m (lateral) - both Low Risk
- Risk: Medium (3) due to approaching longitudinal distance

3. Obstacle 317 (Rear-left):
- Adjusted distances: longitudinal -8.67m, lateral 2.57m
- Relative velocity: longitudinal 0.49 m/s (approaching), lateral -2.47 m/s (approaching)
- TTC longitudinal: 8.67/0.49 = 17.69s (No Risk)
- TTC lateral: 2.57/2.47 = 1.04s (High Risk)
- MDC: 2.57m (lateral) - Medium Risk
- Risk: High (2) due to rapidly closing lateral distance

4. Obstacle 320 (Rear-left):
- Adjusted distances: longitudinal -15.87m, lateral 11.80m
- Relative velocity: longitudinal -1.43 m/s (moving away), lateral -0.99 m/s (approaching)
- TTC longitudinal: Not applicable (moving away)
- TTC lateral: 11.80/0.99 = 11.92s (No Risk)
- MDC: 11.80m (lateral) - No Risk
- Risk: Negligible (5)

Trajectory Analysis:
- Obstacle 30 shows consistent longitudinal closing at ~3.5m/s with lateral movement away
- Obstacle 37 shows steady approach in both dimensions but at safer distances
- Obstacle 317 shows concerning lateral approach at 2.47m/s
- Obstacle 320 poses minimal risk with large distances
