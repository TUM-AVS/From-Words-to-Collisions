At t=0.9s, Ego is in lanelet 8031.0. Let's analyze the obstacles:

* **Obstacle 30.0:** Located in lanelet 8565.0, moving with a velocity of 2.69 m/s.  While the lanelets might be close, the current positions and trajectories don't suggest an immediate collision risk.

* **Obstacle 37.0:** Also in lanelet 8565.0, slow velocity (0.83 m/s).  Poses no immediate threat.

* **Obstacle 317.0:** Located in lanelet 8028.0, velocity 3.53 m/s. This obstacle is getting closer to the Ego vehicle, but the provided data doesn't indicate an immediate collision risk at this timestep (though monitoring is needed in future timesteps).

* **Obstacle 320.0:** Located in lanelet 8028.0, velocity 1.16 m/s.  Doesn't pose an immediate collision risk.
