### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep (0.9 seconds):

### Obstacle Analysis:

1. **Obstacle ID: 30.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Moving in a different lanelet (8565.0) than ego (8031.0). Distance is increasing over time.
   - **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: Velocity is higher than ego's, moving away. No convergence in trajectories.
   - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 5

2. **Obstacle ID: 37.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: In different lanelet (8565.0), moving slowly away from ego's path.
   - **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: Very low velocity (0.83 m/s) and moving away.
   - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 5

3. **Obstacle ID: 317.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: In adjacent lanelet (8028.0), moving towards ego's rear but distance remains safe (>12m).
   - **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: High velocity (3.53 m/s) but trajectory diverging from ego's path.
   - **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 4

4. **Obstacle ID: 320.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: In adjacent lanelet (8028.0), moving parallel to ego but maintaining safe distance (>20m).
   - **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: Velocity similar to ego's (1.16 m/s) but no convergence.
   - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 5

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. All obstacles are in different lanelets than ego (8031.0 vs 8565.0/8028.0)
2. No obstacles show trajectory convergence with ego vehicle
3. Distances are either increasing or maintained at safe levels
4. Highest risk is obstacle 317.0 (Low Risk) due to proximity but no collision course
5. No obstacles meet criteria for collision (0) or extreme risk (1)
