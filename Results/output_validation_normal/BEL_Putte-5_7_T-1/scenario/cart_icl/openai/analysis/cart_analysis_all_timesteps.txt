### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep:

### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 30.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Over the last 9 timesteps, this obstacle has been maintaining a generally increasing distance from the ego vehicle. It is moving parallel and not physically converging toward the ego vehicle.
  - **Distance safety score**: 4
  - **Time Risk reason**: Velocities and accelerations show no significant converging trend toward the Ego's path. Linear increase in speed indicates a stable path that remains away from collision.
  - **Time safety score**: 4
  - **Overall Risk score**: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 32.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: This obstacle is stationary, far from the ego, with no changes over time, indicating no risk of contact.
  - **Distance safety score**: 5
  - **Time Risk reason**: As this obstacle remains stationary and is distant, there's no time-based collision threat.
  - **Time safety score**: 5
  - **Overall Risk score**: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 37.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: This obstacle is not on a collision trajectory given its low and stable speed and relatively constant position distance from the ego vehicle.
  - **Distance safety score**: 4
  - **Time Risk reason**: Low velocity with minor changes suggests stable conditions that don't threaten collision.
  - **Time safety score**: 4
  - **Overall Risk score**: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 317.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Frequent maneuvering yet consistently on a different trajectory compared to the ego vehicle with increasing overall distance.
  - **Distance safety score**: 4
  - **Time Risk reason**: Moderate increase in velocity over time, but shifting away due to trajectory divergence.
  - **Time safety score**: 4
  - **Overall Risk score**: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 320.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: The position remains lateral compared to the ego, with little indication of an intersecting trajectory.
  - **Distance safety score**: 4
  - **Time Risk reason**: Relatively constant velocity with minimal accelerative changes indicates low risk.
  - **Time safety score**: 4
  - **Overall Risk score**: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 321.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Consistent distance and stable movement parallel to the ego path, decreasing any significant risk.
  - **Distance safety score**: 4
  - **Time Risk reason**: Stable speed and minor speed changes are away from potential conflict.
  - **Time safety score**: 4
  - **Overall Risk score**: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 322.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Firm position well outside the ego vehicle lane and maintained lateral displacements reduce collision risk.
  - **Distance safety score**: 4
  - **Time Risk reason**: Slight velocity reductions signify no ongoing risk rise.
  - **Time safety score**: 4
  - **Overall Risk score**: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 325.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: High velocity consistent throughout but moving on a non-converging trajectory parallel to the ego path reduces immediate threat.
  - **Distance safety score**: 4
  - **Time Risk reason**: Substantial distance maintained with decreasing velocity indicating further reduction in collision risk over time.
  - **Time safety score**: 4
  - **Overall Risk score**: 4

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
Based on the evaluation, no obstacles are in the potential collision trajectory with the ego vehicle. All obstacles maintain stable positions and velocities which indicate no imminent threat. The scenario does not contain collision risks, as shown by low potential interaction between ego and any obstacle.
