Obstacle 30 is in the Front-left and is the only obstacle that poses a high risk. It is only 3.29 meters away longitudinally and closing at a speed of -3.48 m/s. While it is slightly to the left (0.05m), the relative lateral velocity suggests it might be moving further left, lessening the immediate risk of collision but still requiring attention.

    "IsCollisionScenario": false,
    "Reasoning": "Obstacle 30 poses an extreme risk due to its close proximity (3.29m) and high closing velocity (-3.48 m/s) in the front-left zone, although it's not an immediate collision."
