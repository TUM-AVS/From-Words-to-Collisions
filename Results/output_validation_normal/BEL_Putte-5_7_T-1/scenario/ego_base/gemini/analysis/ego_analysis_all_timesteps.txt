Obstacle 30 is in the Front-left of the ego vehicle at a longitudinal distance of 3.29m and lateral distance of 0.05m. It is approaching the ego car longitudinally with a relative velocity of -3.48 m/s and laterally moving away with a relative velocity of 2.27 m/s.  Given the short distance and closing longitudinal velocity, this obstacle presents a high risk of collision.

Obstacle 37, at a longitudinal distance of 6.45m and lateral distance of -6.53m, poses a medium risk. While it's approaching longitudinally (-2.24 m/s) and laterally (0.81 m/s), the distances and relative velocities provide more time for reaction compared to Obstacle 30.

Obstacles 317 and 320 are behind the ego vehicle and moving away longitudinally, thus presenting negligible risk. Although they are moving closer laterally, their longitudinal movement decreases the risk of collision.

Given the very close proximity and closing speed of Obstacle 30, a collision is likely imminent.

        "IsCollisionScenario": false,
        "Reasoning": "Obstacle 30 poses an extreme risk due to its close proximity (3.29m longitudinal, 0.05m lateral) and closing longitudinal speed (-3.48 m/s), indicating a high likelihood of imminent collision. While not a guaranteed collision in the next timestep, the risk is very high and requires immediate action.  Other obstacles pose lower risks due to greater distances or diverging paths."
