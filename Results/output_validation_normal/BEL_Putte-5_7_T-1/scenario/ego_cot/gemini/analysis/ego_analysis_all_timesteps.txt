### Safety analysis for timestep 0.9 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 30**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 30 is located in the Front-left, with a longitudinal distance of 3.29m and a lateral distance of 3.29m.  This close proximity indicates a high risk of collision. The fact that it's moving away laterally slightly reduces the risk, but not significantly given the small distance.
- Distance safety score: 2 (High Risk)
- Time Risk reason:  The decreasing longitudinal distance and the relatively high closing velocity suggest a short time to collision.  
- Time safety score: 2 (High Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 2 (High Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 37**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 37 is in the Front-right at a longitudinal and lateral distance of 6.45m. While further away than Obstacle 30, it still presents a moderate risk due to the closing velocity.
- Distance safety score: 3 (Medium Risk)
- Time Risk reason: The closing velocity suggests a moderate time to collision.
- Time safety score: 3 (Medium Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 3 (Medium Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 317**
- Distance Risk reason: Located in the Rear-left at longitudinal and lateral distances of -8.67m. The negative sign indicates it's behind the ego vehicle, posing no immediate longitudinal collision risk. However, the lateral movement towards the ego vehicle introduces some risk.
- Distance safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
- Time Risk reason:  The obstacle is moving closer to the ego vehicle from behind longitudinally, but it's a slower approach with no immediate danger. The lateral motion needs monitoring, but isn't immediately critical.
- Time safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 4 (Low Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 320**
- Distance Risk reason: Situated in the Rear-left at -15.87m both longitudinally and laterally. This distance signifies a low risk.
- Distance safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- Time Risk reason:  The obstacle is moving away longitudinally, further reducing risk. The lateral movement toward the ego vehicle is minimal given the large distance.
- Time safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
