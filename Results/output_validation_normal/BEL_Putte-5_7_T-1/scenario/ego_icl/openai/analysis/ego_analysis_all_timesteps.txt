To analyze the given scenario, we'll focus on the most recent timestep at 0.9 seconds. We'll calculate the Time-to-Collision (TTC) and Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC) for each obstacle using adjusted distances and velocities, considering acceleration and providing a risk level.

### Obstacle-by-Obstacle Analysis:

#### Obstacle 30
- **Position & Motion:**
  - Front-left of the ego car
  - Adjusted longitudinal distance: 3.29 m
  - Adjusted lateral distance: 0.05 m
  - Relative velocity: longitudinal -3.48 m/s (approaching), lateral 2.27 m/s (moving away)

- **Trajectory & Calculations:**
  - Longitudinal TTC = 3.29 / 3.48 ≈ 0.95 seconds
  - Lateral position is increasing, so lateral risk is lower.
  - MDC is primarily based on lateral distance due to zero alignment: 0.05 m

- **Risk Assessment:**
  - Longitudinal TTC suggests high risk (TTC < 1.0s).
  - MDC of 0.05 m suggests extreme risk as it's < 0.5m.
  - Overall Risk Score = 1 (Extreme Risk) due to critical MDC.

#### Obstacle 37
- **Position & Motion:**
  - Front-right of the ego car
  - Adjusted longitudinal distance: 6.45 m
  - Adjusted lateral distance: 6.53 m
  - Relative velocity: longitudinal -2.24 m/s (approaching), lateral 0.81 m/s (approaching)

- **Trajectory & Calculations:**
  - Longitudinal TTC = 6.45 / 2.24 ≈ 2.88 seconds
  - Lateral TTC = 6.53 / 0.81 ≈ 8.06 seconds
  - MDC based on closest approach in either direction is larger than risk thresholds.

- **Risk Assessment:**
  - Longitudinal TTC suggests a medium risk with monitoring required.
  - Both TTC values are above critical thresholds, leading to a medium overall risk score.
  - Overall Risk Score = 3 (Medium Risk)

#### Obstacle 317
- **Position & Motion:**
  - Rear-left of the ego car
  - Adjusted longitudinal distance: -8.67 m
  - Adjusted lateral distance: 2.57 m
  - Relative velocity: longitudinal 0.49 m/s (moving away), lateral -2.47 m/s (approaching)

- **Trajectory & Calculations:**
  - Since obstacle is rear and moving away longitudinally, longitudinal collision risk is low.
  - Lateral TTC = 2.57 / 2.47 ≈ 1.04 seconds

- **Risk Assessment:**
  - Lateral TTC is moderately low, indicating medium risk.
  - Overall risk based on lateral approach since longitudinal risk is negligible.
  - Overall Risk Score = 3 (Medium Risk)

#### Obstacle 320
- **Position & Motion:**
  - Rear-left of the ego car
  - Adjusted longitudinal distance: -15.87 m
  - Adjusted lateral distance: 11.80 m
  - Relative velocity: longitudinal -1.43 m/s (moving away), lateral -0.99 m/s (approaching)

- **Trajectory & Calculations:**
  - Longitudinal and lateral components both increasing relative distance.
  - Low risk of collision as paths are diverging.

- **Risk Assessment:**
  - Longitudinal TTC and MDC are irrelevant as paths don't intersect.
  - Overall Risk Score = 5 (No Risk)

### Conclusion
- Obstacle 30 presents an extreme risk due to a very low MDC with converging trajectories, indicating imminent collision potential.
- Overall, the scenario qualifies as a collision scenario due to Obstacle 30's extreme risk scoring.
