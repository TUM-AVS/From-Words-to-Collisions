Obstacle 32 shows a concerning trend. It's in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle (12922) starting at t=0.4s and is rapidly accelerating while moving towards the ego vehicle.  The y-coordinates are converging, indicating a potential collision risk.  While not an immediate collision in the next timestep, the current trajectories suggest a high probability of a collision soon.

Obstacle 34 is in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle initially (11385).  Its motion appears erratic based on velocity and acceleration changes.  While its current position is not extremely close to the ego vehicle, the unpredictable behavior requires close monitoring.

Obstacle 37 is also initially in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle (11385), but it's farther away and its velocity is low and not rapidly increasing.

Obstacles 313, 319, 331, and 358 are in different lanelets and don't present an immediate risk based on their current positions and trajectories. Obstacle 332 is stationary and far from the ego vehicle's predicted path. Obstacle 358 is in the same lane as the ego vehicle after t=0.4 but moves in the opposite direction.
