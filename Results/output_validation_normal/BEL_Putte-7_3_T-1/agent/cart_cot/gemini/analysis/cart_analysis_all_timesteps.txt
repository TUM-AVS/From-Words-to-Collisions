Here's a breakdown of the collision analysis at t=0.9s:

**Ego Vehicle State:**

* Position: (-241.6922, -554.8178)
* Orientation: 0.8729 rad
* Velocity: 1.6302 m/s
* Acceleration: -0.3691 m/sÂ²

**Obstacles Analysis:**

The primary concern at this timestep is obstacle 32.  Let's analyze each obstacle individually:

* **Obstacle 32:** This obstacle presents the highest risk. Its trajectory indicates a potential collision with the ego vehicle.  It is moving towards the ego vehicle's path.  Given the ego vehicle's deceleration and obstacle 32's acceleration towards the ego vehicle,  a collision is highly likely if both maintain their current course and velocity/acceleration profiles.

* **Obstacle 34:** This obstacle is behind the ego vehicle and is moderately far, posing a low risk of collision in the immediate future, though monitoring is still necessary.

* **Obstacle 37:** This obstacle is significantly behind the ego vehicle and moving slowly.  Collision risk is negligible.

* **Obstacle 313:** This obstacle is far from the ego vehicle's current trajectory and presents no immediate collision risk.

* **Obstacle 319:** While this obstacle has the highest velocity, its trajectory indicates a path away from the ego vehicle, thus posing a low risk.

* **Obstacle 331:** Similar to obstacle 313, this one is relatively far from the ego vehicle and doesn't pose an immediate threat.

* **Obstacle 332:** This is a static obstacle and far away; hence no collision risk.

* **Obstacle 358:** Although sharing a similar lanelet with the ego vehicle, this obstacle is positioned in front and also moving slower than the ego vehicle and therefore presents a low risk for collision.

**Risk Assessment Summary:**
