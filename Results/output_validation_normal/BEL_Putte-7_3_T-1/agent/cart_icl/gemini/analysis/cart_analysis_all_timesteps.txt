Here's the collision risk assessment for the provided scenario, focusing on the last timestep (0.9s):

**Obstacle 32:** This obstacle shares the same lanelet as the ego vehicle and is rapidly approaching from behind.  While not an immediate collision risk at this snapshot, the high closing speed and decreasing distance warrant close monitoring. The risk level is high. Let's assume a simplified TTC calculation for demonstration: if the relative longitudinal velocity is approximately 1.51 - 1.63 = -0.12m/s (Obstacle faster). If the relative distance is 30 meters closing in (approximate based on provided position data which doesn't look to be in meters or else they would be miles apart and irrelevant), then TTC = 30 / 0.12 = 250s.  This simplified example highlights how to apply TTC. Due to the limited scope of data we cannot calculate exact TTC and MDC. 

**Obstacle 34:** This obstacle is in a different lanelet and poses no immediate threat. The lateral distance is significant.

**Obstacle 37:**  Similar to Obstacle 34, this one is also in a different lanelet with a safe lateral separation.  No immediate risk.

**Obstacles 313, 319, 331, 332, 358:** These obstacles are in different lanelets and are relatively far from the ego vehicle, posing no immediate danger.
