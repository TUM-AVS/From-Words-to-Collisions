At t=0.9s, obstacle 32 is closest to the ego vehicle with a longitudinal distance of 3.52m and lateral distance of 0.0m.  It shows that obstacle 32 is directly ahead and approaching the ego vehicle, although the relative longitudinal velocity is decreasing (-0.17 m/s). The decreasing velocity suggests the ego vehicle might be braking or obstacle 32 might be slowing down.  However, the distance is still very close, representing a possible extreme risk. All other obstacles maintain safe distances and lateral separations from the ego vehicle, posing no immediate threat.
