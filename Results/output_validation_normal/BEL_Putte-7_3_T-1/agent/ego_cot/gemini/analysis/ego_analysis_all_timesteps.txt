### Safety analysis for timestep 0.9 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

It's important to note that the provided scenario lacks crucial information for accurate TTC and MDC calculation.  Specifically, the dimensions of the ego vehicle and obstacles are missing.  Therefore, I will make assumptions for demonstration purposes.  A real-world system would have access to this data.

**Assumptions:**

* Ego vehicle and obstacle sizes are approximated as 1.5m wide by 4m long.
* "Adjusted distances" are assumed to be the real distance minus half the respective vehicle/obstacle lengths/widths in that direction.

**General Notes:**

* Obstacles 34 and 37 are behind the ego vehicle and moving away, posing no risk.
* The remaining obstacles are all in front or front-left/right, and require more careful examination.


### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 32**
- Distance Risk reason:  At 3.52m longitudinally, this obstacle is very close. Lateral distance is also 3.52m, indicating potential for a frontal collision. Assuming vehicle widths of 1.5m each, the adjusted lateral distance is around 2m.
- Distance safety score: 1
- Time Risk reason: Without accurate velocity and acceleration, precise TTC is impossible. However, given the proximity and non-zero closing velocity, a collision is very likely if the ego vehicle does not brake or steer immediately.
- Time safety score: 1
- Overall Risk score: 1

- **Obstacle ID: 34**
- Distance Risk reason: Behind the ego vehicle and moving away.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: No risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 37**
- Distance Risk reason: Behind the ego vehicle and moving away.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: No risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 313**
- Distance Risk reason:  Sufficient longitudinal distance, but lateral distance might become a concern.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason:  The closing longitudinal velocity requires monitoring.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 319**
- Distance Risk reason:  Longitudinal and lateral distances shrinking.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: The closing velocity, both longitudinally and laterally, requires attention and possible evasive action.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3

- **Obstacle ID: 331**
- Distance Risk reason:  Similar to 313, but with greater risk due to the lateral component.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason:  The closing velocity, both longitudinally and laterally, is concerning.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3

- **Obstacle ID: 332**
- Distance Risk reason: Sufficient longitudinal distance, and there is no lateral movement reported, however, the precise lateral distance is concerning.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: The closing longitudinal velocity requires monitoring.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 358**
- Distance Risk reason:  Safest among the front obstacles.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Closing velocity needs monitoring but offers ample time to react.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4
