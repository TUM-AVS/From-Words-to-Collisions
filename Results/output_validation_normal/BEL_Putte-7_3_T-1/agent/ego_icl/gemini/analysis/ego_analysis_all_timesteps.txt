Obstacle 32: Located in front and longitudinally approaching the ego vehicle, with exact lateral alignment. The longitudinal distance has decreased consistently across timesteps, from 4.49m to 3.52m, indicating a closing trajectory.  Lateral distance remains 0.00m. With a relative longitudinal velocity of -0.17 m/s, TTC is 3.52 / 0.17 ≈ 20.7 seconds. However, the consistent decrease in distance suggests an imminent collision despite the calculated TTC. MDC is effectively 0m due to the lateral alignment and decreasing longitudinal distance. This contradicts the TTC, but the trend in the raw data suggests a high risk.  Given the persistent closing trajectory and lateral alignment, I classify this as an **Extreme Risk (1)**, overriding the TTC calculation due to the clear and present danger indicated by the raw data trend.

Obstacle 34: Located behind the ego vehicle and moving further away.  Longitudinal distance increases from -4.25m to -5.74m. It poses **Negligible Risk (5)**.

Obstacle 37: Located behind and moving further away. Longitudinal distance increases from -13.15m to -14.65m. It poses **Negligible Risk (5)**.

Obstacle 313: Located diagonally front-right and moving slightly closer longitudinally (13.68m to 12.16m) and slightly further away laterally (-10.54 to -10.46). The slight lateral divergence reduces risk.  Using the smaller of the two distances (longitudinal), TTC is 12.16/1.63 ≈ 7.5s, suggesting Low Risk.  MDC is estimated at >5.0m. Overall, **Low Risk (4)**

Obstacle 319: Located diagonally front-left, approaching both longitudinally (13.75m to 11.97m) and laterally (14.21m to 12.53m). Longitudinal TTC is 11.97/1.61 ≈ 7.4s. Lateral TTC is 12.53/2.34 ≈ 5.4s. MDC is estimated at >5.0m. Although approaching, the distances suggest **Low Risk (4)**

Obstacle 331: Located diagonally front-right, approaching longitudinally (13.71m to 12.10m) while diverging laterally (-0.13m to -1.18m). Longitudinal TTC is 12.1/1.62 ≈ 7.5s. The lateral movement away mitigates risk. MDC is estimated at >5.0m. Overall, **Low Risk (4)**

Obstacle 332:  Located diagonally front-left, and far away, approaching longitudinally (12.98 to 11.87m) with no lateral relative motion. The large lateral distance (22.84m) mitigates risk. Longitudinal TTC is 11.87/1.63 ≈ 7.3s, MDC >5.0m. Therefore, **Low Risk (4)**.

Obstacle 358: Located diagonally front-left and relatively far, approaching longitudinally (16.44m to 14.67m) and slightly diverging laterally (8.78m to 8.87m). Longitudinal TTC is 14.67/1.7 ≈ 8.6s, and MDC >5.0m. Thus, **Low Risk (4)**.
