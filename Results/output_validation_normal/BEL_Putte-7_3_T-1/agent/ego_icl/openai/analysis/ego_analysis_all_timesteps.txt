Certainly. Let's analyze the most recent timestep at 0.9 seconds and evaluate each obstacle:

1. **Obstacle 32:**
   - **Position:** Front, adjusted longitudinal distance = 3.52 m, lateral distance = 0.00 m
   - **Velocity:** Longitudinal = -0.17 m/s, Lateral = 0.42 m/s
   - **Analysis:**
     - The vehicle is directly ahead in the same lane. The lateral alignment is exact, but with a positive lateral velocity, it's moving laterally.
     - Longitudinal velocity is minor (-0.17 m/s), indicating a slow closing motion.
     - **MDC:** Approximately 3.52 m
     - **TTC:** \( \text{TTC}_{\text{long}} = \frac{3.52}{0.17} \approx 20.71 \text{ seconds} \)
     - **Risk Level:** MDC sets it at a Low Risk (4), but the closing velocities indicate no immediate collision risk due to slow changes.

2. **Obstacle 34:**
   - **Position:** Behind, adjusted longitudinal distance = -5.74 m, lateral distance = 0.00 m
   - **Velocity:** Longitudinal = -0.95 m/s, Lateral = -0.01 m/s
   - **Analysis:**
     - The obstacle is behind and moving away, as indicated by the negative velocity.
     - **MDC:** No immediate risk as the longitudinal distance is increasing.
     - **TTC:** Not applicable as it is moving away.
     - **Risk Level:** Negligible Risk (5)

3. **Obstacle 37:**
   - **Position:** Behind, adjusted longitudinal distance = -14.65 m, lateral distance = 0.00 m
   - **Velocity:** Longitudinal = -1.28 m/s
   - **Analysis:**
     - Similarly, behind and with motion away from the ego vehicle.
     - **MDC:** Increasing distance; no imminent risk.
     - **TTC:** Not applicable.
     - **Risk Level:** Negligible Risk (5)

4. **Obstacle 313:**
   - **Position:** Front-right, adjusted longitudinal distance = 12.16 m, lateral distance = -10.46 m
   - **Velocity:** Longitudinal = -1.63 m/s, Lateral = -0.22 m/s
   - **Analysis:**
     - The obstacle is approaching diagonally but with adequate space in both dimensions.
     - **MDC:** The projected paths do not indicate an imminent collision.
     - **TTC:** Both longitudinal and lateral components > 5s, indicating no significant risk.
     - **Risk Level:** Negligible Risk (5)

5. **Obstacle 319:**
   - **Position:** Front-left, adjusted longitudinal distance = 11.97 m, lateral distance = 12.53 m
   - **Velocity:** Longitudinal = -1.61 m/s, Lateral = -2.34 m/s
   - **Analysis:**
     - Obstacle is approaching in both dimensions, but with substantial initial distances.
     - **MDC:** Greater than 5m in both dimensions with increasing lateral alignment.
     - **TTC:** About 7.43 seconds longitudinally and approximately 5.35 seconds laterally.
     - **Risk Level:** Negligible Risk (5)

6. **Obstacle 331:**
   - **Position:** Front-right, adjusted longitudinal distance = 12.10 m, lateral distance = -1.18 m
   - **Velocity:** Longitudinal = -1.62 m/s, Lateral = -1.58 m/s
   - **Analysis:**
     - This obstacle exhibits a strong potential closing due to decreased distances, but still, the initial separations provide reaction time.
     - **MDC:** Combined motion does not indicate rapid convergence.
     - **TTC:** Both components exceed 5 seconds.
     - **Risk Level:** Negligible Risk (5)

7. **Obstacle 332:**
   - **Position:** Front-left, adjusted longitudinal distance = 11.87 m, lateral distance = 22.84 m
   - **Velocity:** Longitudinal = -1.63 m/s, Lateral = 0.00 m/s
   - **Analysis:**
     - The vehicle is closing longitudinally but remains constant laterally.
     - **MDC:** Significant distance in all dimensions prevents immediate risk.
     - **TTC:** Longitudinal calculation provides ample time > 7 seconds.
     - **Risk Level:** Negligible Risk (5)

8. **Obstacle 358:**
   - **Position:** Front-left, adjusted longitudinal distance = 14.67 m, lateral distance = 8.87 m
   - **Velocity:** Longitudinal = -1.70 m/s, Lateral = 0.27 m/s
   - **Analysis:**
     - Approaching in overall longitudinal path, but lateral distancing is adequate.
     - **MDC:** Significant separation, ensuring reaction time.
     - **TTC:** Exceeds the dangerous threshold.
     - **Risk Level:** Negligible Risk (5)

**JSON Summary:**

```json
{
    "CollisionObstacle": {},
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {},
    "HighRiskObstacle": {},
    "MediumRiskObstacle": {},
    "LowRiskObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "32",
        "OverallRiskScore": "4"
    }
}
```

In this analysis, Obstacle 32 shows the highest current threat, being at a low risk level due to its closing trajectory. Other obstacles consistently ensure distance to reaction time, thus remain in negligible risk levels.
