At t=0.9s, Ego (1.0) is in lanelet 12922.0. Obstacle 32.0 is also in the same lanelet and its position is very close to Ego's. Given the velocities, a collision is highly likely in the next timestep.  Obstacle 32.0 has been consistently accelerating towards Ego while Ego's velocity has been decreasing.

    "ObstacleID": "32",
    "OverallRiskScore": 1
  },
  "ScenarioAnalysis": {
    "IsCollisionScenario": false,
    "Reasoning": "Obstacle 32.0 poses an extreme risk due to its proximity to Ego and their respective velocity/acceleration patterns suggesting a likely collision in the next timestep in the shared lanelet 12922.0."
  }
