Obstacle 32 is in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle at the most recent timestep (0.9 seconds). Its position (-237.43414, -547.91656) is very close to the ego's position (-241.6922, -554.8178), and it's moving considerably faster than the ego vehicle (1.5160235 vs 1.6302), however it appears to be positioned laterally adjacent to the ego vehicle, rather than directly in its path.  While proximity and speed differential warrant attention, without lanelet shape information, precise prediction of lateral movement is impossible.  Therefore, I'll classify this obstacle as high risk but not collision imminent at this exact timestep, bearing in mind that the situation could deteriorate rapidly. Note that the change in the Ego vehicle's orientation in this timestep, combined with its entry into lanelet 12922.0 in the previous timestep (where obstacle 32 has consistently resided), suggests a lane change maneuver may be underway.  This reinforces the need for careful monitoring.
