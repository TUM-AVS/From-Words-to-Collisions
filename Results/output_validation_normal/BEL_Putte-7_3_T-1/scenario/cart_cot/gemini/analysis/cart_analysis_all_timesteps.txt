### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:

- Obstacle ID: 32
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 32 is in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle and its x-coordinate is getting closer to the ego vehicle's x-coordinate over time.  While not extremely close at the last timestep, the trend suggests increasing risk.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: Obstacle 32's velocity is increasing, while the ego vehicle's velocity is decreasing. This converging velocity pattern contributes to increased risk over time.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3

- Obstacle ID: 34
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 34 is in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle initially, but the ego vehicle changes lanelets. Obstacle 34 remains relatively far from the ego vehicle in the y-direction.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Obstacle 34's velocity fluctuations do not pose an immediate threat given its distance from the ego vehicle.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- Obstacle ID: 37
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 37 is initially in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle, but the ego vehicle changes lanelets. The y-coordinate difference between obstacle 37 and the ego vehicle is larger than that of obstacle 34, suggesting less risk.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Obstacle 37's low velocity and distance from the ego vehicle pose minimal risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 313
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 313 is in a different lanelet and maintains a safe lateral distance from the ego vehicle.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: The low velocity and trajectory of obstacle 313 pose no immediate threat.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 319
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 319 is in a different lanelet and its trajectory does not intersect with the ego vehicle's path.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: While obstacle 319 has a relatively high velocity, its trajectory does not pose a risk to the ego vehicle.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 331
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 331 is in a different lanelet and maintains a safe distance from the ego vehicle.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Obstacle 331's trajectory and velocity do not pose a risk to the ego vehicle.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 332
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 332 is in a different lanelet and relatively far from the ego vehicle.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Obstacle 332 is stationary, posing no risk to the ego vehicle.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 358
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 358 is initially close to the ego vehicle, but its distance in the y-direction increases over time as the ego vehicle changes lanes.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: The velocity and trajectory of obstacle 358, coupled with the ego vehicleâ€™s lane change, mitigate collision risk.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4


### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. **Most critical obstacle:** Obstacle 32 is the most critical because it's in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle (at the beginning and at timestep 0.9 after ego's lane change) and shows converging trajectory and velocity patterns.
2. **Trajectory Analysis:** Over the 10 timesteps, the ego vehicle starts in lanelet 11385 and transitions to lanelet 12922. Obstacle 32 remains in lanelet 12922 throughout, gradually approaching the ego vehicle's x-coordinate.
3. **Relative Motion:** While obstacle 32's velocity is initially lower than the ego vehicle's, it consistently increases, while the ego vehicle's velocity decreases. This closing velocity, combined with the decreasing x-coordinate distance, increases the collision risk.
4. **Collision Assessment:**  At the last provided timestep (0.9 seconds), a collision hasn't happened. However, the trends suggest a growing risk if these movement patterns continue.
5. **Reasoning:** While the current situation is not a collision, the converging trajectories and velocities of the ego vehicle and obstacle 32 present a medium risk. The historical data reveals this escalating risk, highlighting the importance of continuous monitoring and potential evasive maneuvers.

### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
    "CollisionObstacles": null,
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null,
    "ScenarioAnalysis": {
        "IsCollisionScenario": false,
        "Reasoning": "No collision has occurred. While Obstacle 32 presents a medium risk due to converging trajectories and velocities with the ego vehicle, it doesn't reach the threshold for 'extreme risk' or 'collision' within the analyzed timesteps. Continued monitoring and potential evasive actions are recommended."
