6. **Obstacle ID: 331.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Different lanelet (12961.0), moving away.
   - **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: Moderate velocity (1.580) but diverging path.
   - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)

7. **Obstacle ID: 332.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Static obstacle in different lanelet (11215.0).
   - **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: Zero velocity.
   - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)

8. **Obstacle ID: 358.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: In same lanelet (12922.0) but moving away.
   - **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: Low velocity (0.277) and decelerating.
   - **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low Risk)

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. No obstacles are in immediate collision path (risk score 0).
2. Obstacle 32.0 is the highest risk (score 2) due to proximity and converging path.
3. All other obstacles are either moving away or in different lanelets.
4. Ego vehicle is decelerating, reducing risk further.
