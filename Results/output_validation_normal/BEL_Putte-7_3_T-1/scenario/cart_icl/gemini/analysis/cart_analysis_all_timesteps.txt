- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- Obstacle ID: 319
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 319 is in a different lanelet and not posing an immediate threat.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: No immediate risk due to different lanelets.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 331
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 331 is in a different lanelet.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Low chance of conflict due to different lanelets.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- Obstacle ID: 332
- Distance Risk reason: Not a risk due to being in a different lanelet and far away.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Stationary and not a threat.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 358
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 358 is in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle, but slightly ahead and veering away.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason:  The relative velocity suggests it's moving away from the ego vehicle.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4



### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. The ego vehicle is primarily moving forward with a small deceleration.
2. Obstacle 32 poses the highest risk due to its proximity and relative velocity, warranting close monitoring.
3. No obstacles show immediate signs of a collision at the current timestep.
