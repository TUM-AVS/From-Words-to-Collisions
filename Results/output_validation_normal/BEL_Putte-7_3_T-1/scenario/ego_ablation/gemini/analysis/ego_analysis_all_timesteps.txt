Obstacle 32 is in front of the ego vehicle and approaching longitudinally.  The longitudinal distance is only 3.52 meters, with a closing relative velocity, even though it's decreasing.  While the lateral distance is zero (or unknown), the small longitudinal distance makes this a very high risk situation.
