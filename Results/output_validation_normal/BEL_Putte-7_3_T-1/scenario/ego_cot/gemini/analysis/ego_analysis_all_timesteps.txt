### Safety analysis for timestep 0.9 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

**Missing Information:** The provided scenario lacks crucial information for accurate TTC and MDC calculation. We need the ego vehicle's speed and dimensions, as well as obstacle dimensions. The "adjusted distances" are also not provided, making it impossible to account for vehicle sizes in the risk assessment.  I will proceed with a qualitative analysis based on the available data, but the results will be less precise.  I will assume "adjusted distance" is equal to real distance due to missing information.

### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 32**
- Distance Risk reason: Located in front, with a longitudinal distance of 3.52m and lateral distance of 3.52m, suggesting a very close proximity and potential for frontal collision.
- Distance safety score: 1 (Extreme Risk)
- Time Risk reason:  Longitudinal relative velocity is -0.17 m/s (moving towards ego) suggesting an imminent collision if the ego vehicle doesn't brake or swerve. Lateral relative velocity is not indicative of immediate danger
- Time safety score: 1 (Extreme Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 1 (Extreme Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 34**
- Distance Risk reason: Located behind the ego vehicle, moving away longitudinally. No collision risk.
- Distance safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- Time Risk reason: Moving away from the ego vehicle.
- Time safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 5 (Negligible Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 37**
- Distance Risk reason: Located far behind the ego vehicle and moving away. No collision risk.
- Distance safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- Time Risk reason: Moving away from the ego vehicle.
- Time safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 5 (Negligible Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 313**
- Distance Risk reason: Located front-right and relatively far, but moving closer longitudinally. Lateral movement is away from ego.
- Distance safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
- Time Risk reason: Closing longitudinally, but lateral movement reduces risk.
- Time safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 4 (Low Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 319**
- Distance Risk reason: Located front-left and relatively far, but moving closer both longitudinally and laterally.  Lateral movement is toward the ego vehicle.
- Distance safety score: 3 (Medium Risk)
- Time Risk reason: Closing in both directions, posing a potential collision risk.
- Time safety score: 3 (Medium Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 3 (Medium Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 331**
- Distance Risk reason: Located front-right and relatively far, but moving closer longitudinally.  Lateral movement is away from ego.
- Distance safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
- Time Risk reason: Closing longitudinally, but lateral movement reduces risk.
- Time safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 4 (Low Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 332**
- Distance Risk reason: Located front-left and relatively far, moving closer longitudinally. No lateral movement.
- Distance safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
- Time Risk reason: Closing longitudinally but no lateral movement.
- Time safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 4 (Low Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 358**
- Distance Risk reason: Located front-left and furthest away. Moving closer longitudinally but away laterally.
- Distance safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
- Time Risk reason: Closing longitudinally, but lateral movement reduces risk.
- Time safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 4 (Low Risk)


### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
    "CollisionObstacle": null,
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "32",
        "OverallRiskScore": "1"
    },
    "IsCollisionScenario": false,
    "Justification": "Obstacle 32 poses an extreme risk due to its very close proximity in front of the ego vehicle and its movement towards the ego.  While not a guaranteed collision yet, it is highly likely without immediate evasive action."
}
