Let me analyze the most recent timestep (0.9 seconds) and assess collision risks for each obstacle:

1. Obstacle 32 (Front):
   - Longitudinal distance: 3.52m (decreasing from 3.73m at 0.6s)
   - Lateral distance: 0.00m (but moving laterally at 0.42m/s)
   - Relative velocity: -0.17m/s longitudinally (slowing approach)
   - TTC: 3.52/0.17 = 20.7s (No Risk longitudinally)
   - MDC: Lateral distance is increasing (0.00m â†’ 0.42m/s) - No Risk
   - Overall Risk: 5 (No Risk)

2. Obstacle 34 (Behind):
   - Longitudinal distance: -5.74m (increasing magnitude)
   - Moving away at -0.95m/s
   - No collision risk - diverging paths
   - Overall Risk: 5 (No Risk)

3. Obstacle 37 (Behind):
   - Longitudinal distance: -14.65m (increasing magnitude)
   - Moving away at -1.28m/s
   - No collision risk
   - Overall Risk: 5 (No Risk)

4. Obstacle 313 (Front-right):
   - Longitudinal: 12.16m (-1.63m/s)
   - Lateral: -10.46m (-0.22m/s)
   - Both distances increasing
   - TTC: Not applicable (diverging)
   - Overall Risk: 5 (No Risk)

5. Obstacle 319 (Front-left):
   - Longitudinal: 11.97m (-1.61m/s)
   - Lateral: 12.53m (-2.34m/s)
   - Both distances decreasing but still large
   - TTC longitudinal: 7.43s
   - TTC lateral: 5.35s
   - MDC: Both >5m
   - Overall Risk: 4 (Low Risk)

6. Obstacle 331 (Front-right):
   - Longitudinal: 12.10m (-1.62m/s)
   - Lateral: -1.18m (-1.58m/s)
   - Lateral distance decreasing but still >1m
   - TTC lateral: 0.75s (High Risk)
   - MDC: 1.18m (High Risk)
   - Overall Risk: 2 (High Risk)

7. Obstacle 332 (Front-left):
   - Longitudinal: 11.87m (-1.63m/s)
   - Lateral: 22.84m (no motion)
   - No collision risk
   - Overall Risk: 5 (No Risk)

8. Obstacle 358 (Front-left):
   - Longitudinal: 14.67m (-1.70m/s)
   - Lateral: 8.87m (0.27m/s)
   - Distances large and increasing
   - Overall Risk: 5 (No Risk)

No obstacles meet collision (0) or extreme risk (1) criteria. The highest risk is Obstacle 331 with High Risk (2).

```json
{
    "CollisionObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "None",
        "OverallRiskScore": "None"
    },
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "None",
        "OverallRiskScore": "None"
    },
    "IsCollisionScenario": false,
    "Justification": "No obstacles have collision (0) or extreme risk (1) scores. The highest risk is Obstacle 331 with High Risk (2) due to lateral TTC of 0.75s and MDC of 1.18m, but this doesn't meet collision scenario criteria."
}
