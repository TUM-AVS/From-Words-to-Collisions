Obstacle 335 shows concerning behavior.  Initially, it has a very low velocity and is relatively far from the ego vehicle. However, its acceleration increases drastically over the subsequent timesteps.  By 0.9 seconds, its velocity has increased significantly, making its future trajectory difficult to predict with certainty, but raising concern about a possible collision with the ego vehicle in the near future.

Other obstacles appear to present lower risk at this time. Obstacle 35 is also accelerating but its trajectory is moving away from the ego vehicle. Obstacles 313 and 317 are further away and do not appear to present an immediate risk.
