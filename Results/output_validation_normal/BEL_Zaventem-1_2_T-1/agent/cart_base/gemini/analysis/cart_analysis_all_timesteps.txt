Obstacle 335 shows concerning behavior. Initially, it is moving slowly but its acceleration increases significantly over the timesteps, suggesting erratic or uncontrolled movement.  Its orientation also flips suddenly between 0.3 and 0.4 seconds, further reinforcing this impression. While the lateral distance to the ego vehicle is significant at present, the rapid acceleration and unpredictable orientation changes of obstacle 335 warrant close monitoring and indicate a potential for future high risk.  Obstacle 35 initially seems less concerning, moving slowly and laterally further from the ego vehicleâ€™s trajectory. However, its acceleration also increases noticeably and it makes a sudden orientation change between 0.4 and 0.5 seconds. This change in behavior, combined with its relatively close proximity, calls for attention although its risk is not as high as that of Obstacle 335 at the moment.  Obstacle 313 maintains a consistent slow speed and shows no signs of erratic behavior, making it a low risk currently. Obstacle 317 is a new obstacle which appears far from the ego vehicle and maintains a consistent velocity and acceleration, making it a low risk currently.
