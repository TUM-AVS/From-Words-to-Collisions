Here's a collision risk analysis of the provided scenario, focusing on the last timestep (0.9 seconds) and considering the obstacle trajectories:

**Scenario at 0.9 seconds:**

* **Ego:** Position (-404.8536, -124.7556), Orientation -1.3615 rad, Velocity 9.0533 m/s, Acceleration -1.9189 m/s²
* **Obstacle 35:** Position (-398.85063, -136.65132), Orientation 1.7665 rad, Velocity 0.8492 m/s, Acceleration 0.9992 m/s²
* **Obstacle 313:** Position (-397.30259, -144.46115), Orientation 1.7665 rad, Velocity 0.4805 m/s, Acceleration 0.4114 m/s²
* **Obstacle 317:** Position (-393.87874, -150.93886), Orientation -2.1248 rad, Velocity 0.9689 m/s, Acceleration 0.1197 m/s²
* **Obstacle 335:** Position (-400.50493, -128.40588), Orientation -4.5026 rad, Velocity 1.4961 m/s, Acceleration 1.6786 m/s²

**Analysis:**

Focusing on Obstacle 335, it's the closest to the ego vehicle at the last timestep.  Let's analyze the risk factors:

* **Position:** Obstacle 335's Y-coordinate (-128.40588) is very close to the ego's Y-coordinate (-124.7556).  The X difference is also decreasing over time, indicating a potential lateral collision risk.
* **Velocity and Acceleration:**  Obstacle 335's X velocity is positive and increasing, which means it could potentially move into the ego vehicle’s path and lateral collision risk. Its acceleration suggests this trend will continue. Ego vehicle is also deaccelerating, making collision more probable if Ego vehicle is attempting to avoid collision by braking.
* **Orientation:** While not directly causing a collision, the differing orientations (Ego: -1.36 rad, Obstacle 335: -4.5 rad) add complexity to the scenario, potentially making it more difficult for the ego vehicle to maneuver effectively.

**TTC and MDC Estimation (Obstacle 335):**

Precise TTC and MDC calculation requires complex equations accounting for velocity, acceleration, and orientation. However, a qualitative estimation suggests:

* **MDC:**  The MDC at 0.9s is approximately sqrt((-404.8536 - -400.50493)^2 + (-124.7556 - -128.40588)^2) ≈ 5.4m. This distance is low, indicating high risk.
* **TTC:** Based on the closing velocities in both X and Y directions, a rough TTC estimate appears low, further increasing collision risk.

**Other Obstacles:**

Obstacles 35, 313, and 317 have larger Y coordinates than the ego vehicle. Though these other obstacles are currently further away than Obstacle 335 at t=0.9s, their trajectories, velocities and accelerations are key indicators for potential high-risk situations at future time steps. It's essential for the ego vehicle to be aware of their presence and predict their movement accurately.


**Risk Assessment:**

* **Obstacle 335:** High Risk (Overall Risk Score 2). The close proximity, combined with the relative velocities and accelerations, suggest a high probability of collision in the immediate future if no evasive action is taken.

* **Obstacles 35, 313, 317:** Medium Risk (Overall Risk Score 3). They are not currently an immediate threat but require monitoring due to their positions, orientation and velocities.
