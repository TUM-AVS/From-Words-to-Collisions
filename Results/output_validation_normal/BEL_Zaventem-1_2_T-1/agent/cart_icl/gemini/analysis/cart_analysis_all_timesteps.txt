At t=0.9s, the ego vehicle is at (-404.85, -124.76) with a velocity of 9.05 m/s and accelerating at -1.92 m/s².  Let's analyze the risk posed by each obstacle:

* **Obstacle 35:** Located at (-398.85, -136.65), this obstacle is laterally offset and slightly ahead of the ego vehicle. Its velocity is 0.85 m/s and accelerating at 1.00 m/s². While the lateral distance suggests minimal collision risk, the longitudinal distance is decreasing.  Further monitoring is needed, but currently presents low risk.

* **Obstacle 313:** Positioned at (-397.30, -144.46), this obstacle is further laterally offset and slightly ahead of the ego. Its velocity is 0.48 m/s and accelerating at 0.41 m/s². Similar to obstacle 35, the lateral separation suggests a low probability of collision, but it is moving toward the ego's path and requires more observation.

* **Obstacle 317:** Located at (-393.88, -150.94), this obstacle maintains the trend of increasing lateral offset compared to obstacles 35 and 313, which suggests a low probability of collision at this instant. Velocity (0.97 m/s) and acceleration (0.12 m/s²) do not significantly change the risk profile. It needs further observation.

* **Obstacle 335:**  At (-400.50, -128.41), this obstacle is the closest to the ego vehicle, both laterally and longitudinally, and poses the highest risk. Its velocity is 1.50 m/s and acceleration 1.68 m/s².  The relatively small lateral distance and its movement towards the ego's path increase risk. While not an immediate collision, this obstacle requires close attention.  Calculating the exact TTC is difficult without precise vehicle dimensions, but the closing velocity and proximity suggest a medium risk level.
