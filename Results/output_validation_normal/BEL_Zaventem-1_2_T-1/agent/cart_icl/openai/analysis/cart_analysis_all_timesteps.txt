Upon examining the provided scenario at the most recent timestep (0.9 seconds), the key observations are as follows:

### Overview of the Ego Vehicle:
- The Ego's position is moving continuously from coordinates, with a decreasing velocity from 11.78 m/s to 9.05 m/s at 0.9s. This continuous deceleration suggests it is slowing down, possibly preparing to stop or maintain lane control.
- The vehicle is staying in lanelet 23411.0, with orientation changes indicating it is aligned to the lane direction.
  
### Obstacle Analysis:
1. **Obstacle 35.0**:
   - Location: Moving slowly with relatively small velocity changes, located in lanelet 23242.0.
   - Relative motion to Ego: At 0.9 seconds, obstacle 35.0 is at a significant position difference of approximately 11m lateral from the Ego vehicle. Given its low velocity (0.8492 m/s), it poses no immediate collision threat.
   - Risk Assessment: **Negligible Risk (5)**

2. **Obstacle 313.0**:
   - Location: Positioned within lanelet 23316.0, which is possibly adjacent or nearby lanes relative to the Ego's lanelet.
   - Behavior: Moderate velocity but with minimal acceleration, indicating a stable trajectory; relative distance remains similarly non-threatening due to a lateral difference.
   - Risk Assessment: **Negligible Risk (5)**

3. **Obstacle 317.0**:
   - Location: Recently appeared in the scene and positioned quite far (>20m) from the Ego vehicle in lanelet 23243.0.
   - Given its speed and late entry into the scene, it remains a non-threat to the Ego trajectory.
   - Risk Assessment: **Negligible Risk (5)**

4. **Obstacle 335.0**:
   - Location: Positioned repeatedly nearby but in a different lanelet 23392.0.
   - Motion Analysis: Increasing velocity (1.4961 m/s) yet still maintaining a safe distance laterally and longitudinally from the Ego. 

### Conclusion:
- **General Distance**: All calculated positions show that all obstacles maintain more than safe distances in terms of lateral gaps and do not show patterns for potential collision.
- **TTC and MDC**: Given the Ego's continuous deceleration and the existing velocities and positions of obstacles, there are no immediate threats of collision approaching zero time-to-collision, nor do minimum distances suggest an imminent intersection.
