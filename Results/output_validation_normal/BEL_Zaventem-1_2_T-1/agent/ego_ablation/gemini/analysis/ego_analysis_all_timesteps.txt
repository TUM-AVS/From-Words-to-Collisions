At t=0.9s, Obstacle 335 is showing a very high risk of collision. It has essentially reached the ego vehicle's longitudinal position (0.0m longitudinal distance) while being just 1.89m to the left.  Although it appears to be moving away laterally from the ego vehicle, the small lateral distance combined with the -10.55 m/s relative longitudinal velocity indicates a likely collision within the next few timesteps. Obstacle 35 is also approaching the ego vehicle longitudinally and is at 8.38m distance, posing a potential risk, but it is not yet considered as extreme risk given the current dynamics. Other obstacles are further away and not exhibiting immediate risk. Therefore, Obstacle 335 is the primary concern.
