Obstacle 335 is at longitudinal distance 0.00m and lateral distance 1.89m relative to the ego vehicle.  It has a relative longitudinal velocity of -10.55 m/s, meaning it's moving towards the ego vehicle.  Given the near-zero longitudinal distance, a collision is imminent. Obstacle 35 is at longitudinal distance 8.38m and lateral distance 1.79m with a closing velocity of -9.90 m/s. This represents a high risk. Obstacle 313 at longitudinal distance 16.34 and a closing velocity of -9.53 is a medium risk.  Obstacle 317 is at longitudinal distance 23.38m and lateral distance 3.69m with a closing velocity of -8.35 m/s and a lateral velocity of -0.67m/s indicating it is moving towards the ego vehicle both longitudinally and laterally, this is a medium risk.
