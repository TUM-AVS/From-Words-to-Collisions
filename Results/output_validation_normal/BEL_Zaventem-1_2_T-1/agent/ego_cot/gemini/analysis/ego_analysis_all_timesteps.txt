### Safety analysis for timestep 0.9 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

**- Obstacle ID: 35**
- Distance Risk reason:  Obstacle is located 8.38m longitudinally and 8.38m laterally (front-left) from the ego vehicle.  This indicates some risk, although the lateral movement away from the ego vehicle slightly reduces the risk.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: The continuous approach of the obstacle towards the ego vehicle longitudinally while moving away laterally needs attention.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3

**- Obstacle ID: 313**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is located 16.34m longitudinally and 16.34m laterally (front-left) from the ego vehicle.  This comfortable distance poses low risk.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: While the obstacle is approaching longitudinally, the lateral movement away from the ego vehicle, combined with the greater distance and slower relative longitudinal velocity than obstacle 35, lowers the risk.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

**- Obstacle ID: 317**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is located 23.38m longitudinally and 23.38m laterally (front-left) from the ego vehicle. This significant distance represents minimal risk.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: The obstacle's longitudinal approach is slow, and its lateral movement toward the ego vehicle is also very slow. Combined with the large distance, this presents negligible risk in the short term.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5


**- Obstacle ID: 335**
- Distance Risk reason: Collision has occurred. The distance is 0.0m both longitudinally and laterally.
- Distance safety score: 0
- Time Risk reason: Collision imminent.
- Time safety score: 0
- Overall Risk score: 0
