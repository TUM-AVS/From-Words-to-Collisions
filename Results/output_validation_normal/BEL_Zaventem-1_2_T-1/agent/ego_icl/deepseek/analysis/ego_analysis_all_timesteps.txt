### Obstacle-by-Obstacle Analysis (Most Recent Timestep: 0.9s)

---

#### **Obstacle 35** (Front-left)
- **Adjusted Position**: Longitudinal 8.38m, Lateral 1.79m  
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal -9.90 m/s (approaching), Lateral 0.01 m/s (moving away)  
- **Motion**: Driving toward ego longitudinally, moving away laterally to the left.  

**Risk Assessment**:
1. **Longitudinal TTC**: 8.38 / 9.90 ≈ 0.85s (High Risk)  
2. **Lateral TTC**: Not applicable (moving away)  
3. **MDC**: Lateral distance is stable/increasing (1.79m). Longitudinal distance is closing but still > 3.0m (Medium Risk).  
   - **Overall Risk**: High Risk (2) due to longitudinal TTC < 1.0s.

#### **Obstacle 313** (Front-left)
- **Adjusted Position**: Longitudinal 16.34m, Lateral 1.68m  
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal -9.53 m/s (approaching), Lateral 0.01 m/s (moving away)  
- **Motion**: Driving toward ego longitudinally, moving away laterally to the left.  

**Risk Assessment**:
1. **Longitudinal TTC**: 16.34 / 9.53 ≈ 1.71s (Medium Risk)  
2. **Lateral TTC**: Not applicable (moving away)  
3. **MDC**: Lateral distance stable (1.68m). Longitudinal distance > 5.0m (No Risk).  
   - **Overall Risk**: Medium Risk (3) due to longitudinal TTC < 3.0s.

#### **Obstacle 317** (Front-left)
- **Adjusted Position**: Longitudinal 23.38m, Lateral 3.69m  
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal -8.35 m/s (approaching), Lateral -0.67 m/s (approaching from left)  
- **Motion**: Driving toward ego longitudinally and laterally.  

**Risk Assessment**:
1. **Longitudinal TTC**: 23.38 / 8.35 ≈ 2.80s (Medium Risk)  
2. **Lateral TTC**: 3.69 / 0.67 ≈ 5.51s (No Risk)  
3. **MDC**: Lateral distance is large (3.69m), but closing. Longitudinal distance > 5.0m.  
   - **Overall Risk**: Medium Risk (3) due to longitudinal TTC < 3.0s.  

---

#### **Obstacle 335** (Left)
- **Adjusted Position**: Longitudinal 0.00m (aligned), Lateral 1.89m  
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal -10.55 m/s (approaching), Lateral -0.00 m/s (minimal lateral motion)  
- **Motion**: Exact longitudinal alignment, minimal lateral movement.  

**Critical Risk Assessment**:
1. **Longitudinal TTC**: 0.00m alignment with closing velocity (Extreme Risk).  
   - If lateral distance were also closing, this would be Collision (0).  
2. **Lateral TTC**: Not applicable (stable distance).  
3. **MDC**: Lateral distance is 1.89m (Low Risk), but longitudinal alignment with closing velocity is critical.  
   - **Overall Risk**: Extreme Risk (1) due to longitudinal alignment and closing velocity.

### Key Findings:
- **Obstacle 335** is at **Extreme Risk (1)** due to exact longitudinal alignment with high closing velocity (-10.55 m/s). While lateral distance is stable (1.89m), the longitudinal trajectory poses imminent danger.  
- **Obstacle 35** is at **High Risk (2)** due to rapid longitudinal closure (TTC ≈ 0.85s).  
- No active collision (Risk 0) observed.  
- Other obstacles (313, 317) are at Medium Risk (3) due to manageable TTCs.  

**Action Required**: Immediate braking or evasive action for Obstacle 335. Monitor Obstacle 35 closely.
