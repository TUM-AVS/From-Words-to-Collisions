### Analysis of Obstacle Risks

#### Obstacle 35
- **Trajectory and Motion**: 
  - **Initial Position**: Front-left
  - **Longitudinal Distance**: 17.64m to 8.38m (continuously decreasing)
  - **Velocity**: Longitudinal decrease from -12.12 m/s to -9.90 m/s
  - **Lateral Distance**: Remained around 1.78-1.79m
  - **Observation**: Consistent approach in the longitudinal direction but stable laterally.
- **Current Timestep**: 
  - **Longitudinal Distance**: 8.38m
  - **Relative Longitudinal Velocity**: -9.90 m/s
- **TTC Calculation**:
  - TTC (Longitudinal) = 8.38m / 9.90 m/s ≈ 0.85s
- **MDC Calculation**:
  - Based on trajectory, MDC ≈ 8.38m (as lateral distance is not closing significantly)
- **Conclusion**: The risk of collision is primarily in the longitudinal approach. The lateral distance is stable. 
- **Risk Score**: High Risk (2) – Due to TTC < 1 second.

#### Obstacle 313
- **Trajectory and Motion**: 
  - **Initial Position**: Front-left
  - **Longitudinal Distance**: 24.25m to 16.34m (decreasing)
  - **Velocity**: Longitudinal decrease from -11.88 m/s to -9.53 m/s
  - **Lateral Distance**: Nearly stable around 1.68m
  - **Observation**: Continuous approach in the longitudinal direction with minimal lateral movement.
- **Current Timestep**: 
  - **Longitudinal Distance**: 16.34m
  - **Relative Longitudinal Velocity**: -9.53 m/s
- **TTC Calculation**:
  - TTC (Longitudinal) = 16.34m / 9.53 m/s ≈ 1.71s
- **MDC Calculation**:
  - Based on trajectory, MDC ≈ 16.34m
- **Conclusion**: Longitudinal approach is significant but slower; lateral stability reduces immediate risk. 
- **Risk Score**: Medium Risk (3) – Due to longitudinal TTC between 1s and 3s.

#### Obstacle 317
- **Trajectory and Motion**: 
  - **Position Crossed Over Time**: Starting at longer distances without significant risk.
  - **Current Timestep**: Approaching both longitudinally and laterally.
  - **Distance Changes**: From 24.30m longitudinally at 0.8s to 23.38m, lateral 3.73m to 3.69m.
- **Observation**: Approaching in both dimensions; however, initial distances are large.
- **Risk Assessment**: Low considering current proximity and rate of closure.
- **Risk Score**: Low Risk (4) - Due to large enough margin currently, but approaching.

#### Obstacle 335
- **Trajectory and Motion**: 
  - **Initial Position**: Front-left
  - **Longitudinal Distance**: 9.42m to almost 0m, effective alignment by 0.9s
  - **Velocity**: Longitudinal reduction from -11.81 m/s to -10.55 m/s
  - **Lateral Distance**: Consistent at around 1.88m, approaching but staying somewhat stable
- **Current Timestep**: 
  - **Longitudinal Distance**: Near 0.00m
  - **Observation**: Exact alignment longitudinally, indicated in motion description.
- **TTC Calculation**:
  - TTC (Longitudinal) ≤ 0, as the distances have effectively aligned and vehicle has reached alongside.
- **MDC Calculation**:
  - MDC for longitudinal alignment ≈ 0m
- **Conclusion**: High urgency due to alignment on longitudinal dimension, representing an extremely risky situation.
- **Risk Score**: Collision (0) – Due to direct alignment and close proximity.

### Final Note:
The collision risk with Obstacle 335 is critical due to its complete longitudinal alignment with no effective lateral movement to mitigate. Immediate action is necessary.
