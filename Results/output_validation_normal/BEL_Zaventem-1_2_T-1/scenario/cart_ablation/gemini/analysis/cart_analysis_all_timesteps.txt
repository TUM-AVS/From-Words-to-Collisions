At t=0.9s, Ego is at (-404.85, -124.76) traveling at 9.05 m/s.

Obstacle 335 is at (-400.50, -128.41) traveling at 1.50 m/s.  While the y-coordinates are relatively close, Obstacle 335 is accelerating and its orientation flipped significantly between t=0.8s and t=0.9s (1.78 rad to -4.50 rad) suggesting erratic behavior. It might cut into the Ego vehicle's path. This represents an extreme risk.

Obstacle 35 is at (-398.85, -136.65) with a velocity of 0.85 m/s and accelerating.  Given its trajectory and distance from the Ego, it does not pose an immediate threat.

Obstacle 313 is at (-397.30, -144.46) traveling at 0.48 m/s and accelerating slowly. It is not a risk to Ego at this timestep.

Obstacle 317 is at (-393.88, -150.94) traveling at 0.97 m/s. It is not a risk to Ego at this timestep.
