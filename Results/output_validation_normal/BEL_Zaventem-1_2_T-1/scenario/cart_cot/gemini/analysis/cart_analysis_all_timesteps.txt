### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 35.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 35.0 is laterally separated from the ego vehicle and moving further away.  The historical trajectory shows it has consistently been laterally offset.  While its longitudinal position is closer to the ego vehicle than other obstacles, the lateral distance and differing trajectories greatly reduce collision risk.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Obstacle 35.0's velocity and acceleration patterns suggest it is not on a collision course with the ego vehicle. The historical data reinforces this, showing no indication of convergence in their paths.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- Obstacle ID: 313.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 313.0 maintains a safe lateral distance from the ego vehicle throughout the observed timeframe. The historical trajectory shows it has consistently been laterally separated.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: The relative velocities and accelerations of the ego vehicle and Obstacle 313.0, combined with their lateral separation, indicate a very low probability of collision.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 317.0
- Distance Risk reason: While Obstacle 317.0 appears further away than others at this timestep, its introduction in the most recent time steps warrants attention.  Further observation is needed to confirm long-term safety. Its lateral position is further away than obstacle 35.0.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason:  Obstacle 317.0 has a moderate velocity, and more data is needed to confidently assess its trajectory and potential for interaction with the ego vehicle.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4


- Obstacle ID: 335.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 335.0 is the closest obstacle longitudinally and has minimal lateral separation at this time step. Its trajectory over the past several timesteps shows it moving slightly closer to the ego vehicle’s path.  Though there is some lateral separation, it's minimal.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: Obstacle 335.0 exhibits fluctuating acceleration.  While the current trajectory doesn't imply immediate collision, the varying acceleration, combined with proximity, requires careful monitoring. Its lateral motion is minimal.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3


### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. **Most critical obstacle:** Obstacle 335.0 poses the highest risk due to its proximity and uncertain acceleration pattern. While other obstacles are closer longitudinally (35.0), 335.0's fluctuating behavior and closer lateral positioning demands closer attention.
2. **Trajectory analysis:** Over the 10 timesteps, the ego vehicle maintains a relatively straight path with decreasing velocity. Obstacle 335.0 shows a slight drift towards the ego vehicle’s path, increasing the need for careful monitoring.  Other obstacles maintain consistent lateral separation.
3. **Relative position, velocity, and acceleration:** Obstacle 335.0's proximity, combined with fluctuating acceleration, raises concern.  The ego vehicle's deceleration might slightly mitigate the risk, but the situation warrants constant monitoring.
4. **Collision determination:** Based on the current data, no collision has occurred. While not immediately imminent, the potential for collision with obstacle 335.0 exists, making it the most important obstacle to monitor.
5. **Reasoning:**  The analysis focuses on relative position and movement trends. Obstacle 335.0's behavior is less predictable than others, requiring closer attention despite the current lack of immediate collision risk.

  "CollisionObstacles": null,
  "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null,
  "ScenarioAnalysis": {
    "IsCollisionScenario": false,
    "Reasoning": "No collision has occurred. Obstacle 335.0 presents the highest risk due to its relatively close proximity, fluctuating acceleration, and observed movement slightly closer to the ego vehicle's path over the analyzed timesteps. However, at the current moment, a collision is not imminent, but the situation requires continued close monitoring."
