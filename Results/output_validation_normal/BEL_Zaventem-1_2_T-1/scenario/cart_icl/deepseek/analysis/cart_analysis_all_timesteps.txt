### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep (0.9 seconds):

### Obstacle Analysis:
1. **Obstacle ID: 35.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Located in lanelet 23242.0, which is different from ego's lanelet (23411.0). The obstacle is moving away from the ego vehicle (increasing Y-distance over time).
   - **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: Low velocity (0.849 m/s) and increasing distance. No immediate threat.
   - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)

2. **Obstacle ID: 313.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Located in lanelet 23316.0, different from ego's lanelet. Moving away in Y-direction.
   - **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: Low velocity (0.481 m/s) and increasing distance.
   - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)

3. **Obstacle ID: 317.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Located in lanelet 23243.0, far from ego's lanelet. Moving away in Y-direction.
   - **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: Low velocity (0.969 m/s) and increasing distance.
   - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)

4. **Obstacle ID: 335.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Located in lanelet 23392.0, different from ego's lanelet. Moving away in Y-direction.
   - **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: Higher velocity (1.496 m/s) but moving away.
   - **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low Risk)

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. **Lanelet Check**: Ego is in lanelet 23411.0, all obstacles are in different lanelets (23242.0, 23316.0, 23243.0, 23392.0).
2. **Trajectory Analysis**: All obstacles are moving away from the ego vehicle in the Y-direction.
3. **Velocity/Acceleration**: Ego is decelerating, obstacles have low or moderate velocities.
4. **Conclusion**: No collision risk. All obstacles are either stationary or moving away.
