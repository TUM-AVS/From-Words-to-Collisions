### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
Based on the provided data, the ego vehicle maintains a safe distance from all obstacles at the most recent timestep (0.9s). No obstacle poses an immediate collision risk.  The ego vehicle is moving faster than the obstacles and is progressively getting further away. The relative velocities and positions do not indicate a collision.  This is not a collision scenario.

### Summary in JSON Format:

  "CollisionObstacles": null,
  "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null,
  "ScenarioAnalysis": {
    "IsCollisionScenario": false,
    "Reasoning": "No obstacle poses an immediate collision risk. Ego vehicle maintains a safe distance and is moving away from all obstacles."
  }
