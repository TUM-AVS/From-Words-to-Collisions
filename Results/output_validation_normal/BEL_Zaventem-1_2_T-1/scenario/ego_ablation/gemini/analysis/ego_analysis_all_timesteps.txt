Obstacle 335 is at a longitudinal distance of 0.00 m and a lateral distance of 1.89 m relative to the ego vehicle.  The nearly zero longitudinal distance indicates a collision is imminent in the next timestep as the relative longitudinal velocity is -10.55 m/s. While it's slightly offset laterally, the lateral distance is not enough to avoid collision given the current velocities.  The ego vehicle's left side is about to collide with Obstacle 335. Thus, Obstacle 335 receives the lowest risk score (0), indicating a collision.
