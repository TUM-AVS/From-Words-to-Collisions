Obstacle 335 is at 0 longitudinal distance and 1.89 lateral distance from the ego vehicle. It has a negative longitudinal velocity, indicating it and the ego car are on a collision course. The lateral velocity is approximately 0, however, and it is now positioned to the left of the ego vehicle. This suggests a collision has occurred or is imminent.

**Risk Levels and Definitions:**
Collision (Score: 0): Actual collision has occurred or is unavoidable within the next timestep.
Extreme Risk (Score: 1): Immediate collision or very high likelihood of impact. Urgent action is required.
High Risk (Score: 2): Close to collision or highly probable collision path. Needs prompt attention and quick manoeuvring.
Medium Risk (Score: 3): Moderate collision risk but manageable with timely reactions and proper strategies.
Low Risk (Score: 4): Minimal collision risk. The situation is controllable with sufficient time to react.
Negligible Risk (Score: 5): No significant collision risk. Obstacles are either moving away or far enough not to interfere.
