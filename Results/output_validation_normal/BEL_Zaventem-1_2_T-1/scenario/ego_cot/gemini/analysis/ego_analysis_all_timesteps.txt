### Safety analysis for timestep 0.9 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 35**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 35 is located 8.38m longitudinally and 8.38m laterally in the front-left of the ego vehicle. While the distance is not extremely close, the continued longitudinal movement towards the ego vehicle represents a potential risk.
- Distance safety score: 3 (Medium Risk)
- Time Risk reason:  Without precise velocity and acceleration information, TTC cannot be accurately determined. However, the obstacle's ongoing approach suggests a moderate time to collision risk.
- Time safety score: 3 (Medium Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 3 (Medium Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 313**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 313 is located 16.34m longitudinally and 16.34m laterally in the front-left. This distance presents a lower risk compared to Obstacle 35.
- Distance safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
- Time Risk reason:  Similar to Obstacle 35, a precise TTC calculation isn't possible without more details. However, the larger distance suggests more time to react.
- Time safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 4 (Low Risk)


- **Obstacle ID: 317**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 317 is positioned 23.38m longitudinally and 23.38m laterally in the front-left.  This poses the least risk among the observed obstacles.
- Distance safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- Time Risk reason: Given its distance and the reported motion, the TTC is likely high, indicating low risk.
- Time safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 5 (Negligible Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 335**
- Distance Risk reason:  Obstacle 335 has collided with the ego vehicle (0m longitudinal and 0m lateral distance) at this timestep.
- Distance safety score: 0 (Collision)
- Time Risk reason:  Collision has already occurred, making TTC irrelevant.
- Time safety score: 0 (Collision)
- Overall Risk score: 0 (Collision)
