* **Obstacle 35 Analysis:**

    * Trajectory: Obstacle 35 has been consistently in the front-left of the ego vehicle, approaching longitudinally but moving away laterally.
    * At t=0.9s:
        * Longitudinal distance: 8.38m
        * Lateral distance: 1.79m
        * Longitudinal relative velocity: -9.90 m/s (approaching)
        * Lateral relative velocity: 0.01 m/s (almost no lateral movement)
    * TTC (longitudinal): 8.38m / 9.90m/s ≈ 0.85s 
    * MDC: Primarily lateral distance due to being front-left; MDC ≈ 1.79m
    * Risk Assessment:
        * Longitudinal Risk (based on TTC): Medium Risk (3)
        * Lateral Risk: Medium Risk (3)
        * Overall Risk: Medium Risk (3)

* **Obstacle 313 Analysis:**

    * Trajectory: Similar to Obstacle 35, consistently front-left, approaching longitudinally and moving slightly away laterally.
    * At t=0.9s:
        * Longitudinal distance: 16.34m
        * Lateral distance: 1.68m
        * Longitudinal relative velocity: -9.53 m/s (approaching)
        * Lateral relative velocity: 0.01 m/s (almost no lateral movement)
    * TTC (longitudinal): 16.34m / 9.53m/s ≈ 1.71s
    * MDC: Primarily lateral distance, MDC ≈ 1.68m
    * Risk Assessment:
        * Longitudinal Risk: Medium Risk (3)
        * Lateral Risk: Medium Risk (3)
        * Overall Risk: Medium Risk (3)

* **Obstacle 317 Analysis:**

    * Trajectory:  This obstacle appears at t=0.8s in the front-left and continues to approach both longitudinally and laterally.
    * At t=0.9s:
        * Longitudinal distance: 23.38m
        * Lateral distance: 3.69m
        * Longitudinal relative velocity: -8.35 m/s (approaching)
        * Lateral relative velocity: -0.67 m/s (approaching) 
    * TTC (longitudinal): 23.38m / 8.35m/s ≈ 2.80s
    * TTC (lateral): 3.69m / 0.67m/s ≈ 5.51s
    * MDC: Since both are closing, consider the smaller distance, MDC ≈ 3.69m
    * Risk Assessment:
        * Longitudinal Risk: Medium Risk (3)
        * Lateral Risk: Low Risk (4)
        * Overall Risk: Medium Risk (3)


* **Obstacle 335 Analysis:**

    * Trajectory: Obstacle 335 has been consistently approaching the ego vehicle longitudinally while initially moving slightly away laterally.  At t=0.9s, it reaches exact longitudinal alignment.
    * At t=0.9s:
        * Longitudinal distance: 0.00m
        * Lateral distance: 1.89m
        * Longitudinal relative velocity: -10.55 m/s (approaching)
        * Lateral relative velocity: -0.00 m/s (almost no lateral movement)
    * TTC (longitudinal): Not applicable due to 0 distance, but the high closing velocity indicates extreme risk.
    * MDC: Since there's exact longitudinal alignment, MDC is the lateral distance, MDC ≈ 1.89m.
    * Risk Assessment:
        * Longitudinal Risk: Extreme Risk (1) due to near-zero distance and high negative velocity, indicating a very close pass or potential collision.
        * Lateral Risk: Medium Risk (3)
        * Overall Risk: Extreme Risk (1) - Prioritize the higher risk from longitudinal movement


* **Collision Scenario Determination:**

Yes, this is a collision scenario. Obstacle 335 poses an Extreme Risk (1) due to near-zero longitudinal distance and high closing velocity at the most recent timestep.
