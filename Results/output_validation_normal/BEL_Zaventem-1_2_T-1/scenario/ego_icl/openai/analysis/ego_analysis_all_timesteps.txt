### Obstacle-by-Obstacle Analysis:

#### Obstacle 35:
- **Relative Position and Motion:** Front-left, Longitudinal = 8.38 m, Lateral = 1.79 m
- **Trajectory (Past Data):** Continuously approaching from the front-left, decreasing longitudinal and stabilizing lateral distance.
- **Relative Velocity:** Longitudinal -9.90 m/s, Lateral 0.01 m/s
- **TTC Calculation:** 
  - Longitudinal = 8.38 m / 9.90 m/s = 0.85 seconds
- **MDC (Assuming adjustment factors already applied):** The smallest distance remains the direct longitudinal approach calculated as 8.38 m as obstacle stabilizes laterally.
- **Risk Assessment:** 
  - TTC around 0.85 seconds implies High Risk (score 2).
  - MDC = Longitudinal distance + consistent lateral distance implies No Risk
  - Converging trajectories implicate significant risk.
  - **Overall Risk Score:** 2 (High Risk due to approaching trajectory and TTC)

#### Obstacle 313:
- **Relative Position and Motion:** Front-left, Longitudinal = 16.34 m, Lateral = 1.68 m
- **Trajectory (Past Data):** Approaching from a significant distance, lateral remaining approximately constant.
- **Relative Velocity:** Longitudinal -9.53 m/s, Lateral 0.01 m/s
- **TTC Calculation:** 
  - Longitudinal = 16.34 m / 9.53 m/s = 1.71 seconds
- **MDC:** Remains the longitudinal distance as obstacle stabilizes laterally.
- **Risk Assessment:** 
  - TTC around 1.71 seconds implies Medium Risk (score 3).
  - **Overall Risk Score:** 3 (Medium Risk)

#### Obstacle 317:
- **Relative Position and Motion:** Front-left, Longitudinal = 23.38 m, Lateral = 3.69 m
- **Trajectory (Past Data):** Approaching from a distance, both longitudinal and lateral closing simultaneously.
- **Relative Velocity:** Longitudinal -8.35 m/s, Lateral -0.67 m/s
- **TTC Calculation:** 
  - Longitudinal = 23.38 m / 8.35 m/s = 2.80 seconds
  - Lateral = 3.69 m / 0.67 m/s = 5.51 seconds
- **MDC:** Since both lateral and longitudinal distances are reasonably large, minimal chance of immediate collision.
- **Risk Assessment:**
  - TTC signifies no immediate risk over 2.8 seconds in longitudinal direction.
  - Overall path analysis positions it beyond imminent threat.
  - **Overall Risk Score:** 3 (Medium Risk)

#### Obstacle 335:
- **Relative Position and Motion:** Left, Longitudinal = 0.00 m (Exact alignment), Lateral = 1.89 m
- **Trajectory (Past Data):** Consistently decreasing longitudinally, stabilized laterally.
- **Relative Velocity:** Longitudinal -10.55 m/s, Lateral -0.00 m/s
- **TTC Calculation:** Not practically applicable; due to the extreme closeness.
- **MDC:** 1.89 m laterally since longitudinally maintains exact alignment.
- **Risk Assessment:** 
  - Longitudinal alignment with very close lateral positioning may lead to a conflict.
  - Short remaining lateral distance poses a significant threat but not immediate collision.
  - **Overall Risk Score:** 1 (Extreme Risk due to exact longitudinal alignment and converging path)

### Conclusion: Collision Scenario Determination

Given the risk assessments, Obstacle 335 poses an Extreme Risk due to its exact alignment longitudinally and the very close lateral proximity coupled with the converging motion. This assessment justifies identifying the scenario as a potential collision scenario.
