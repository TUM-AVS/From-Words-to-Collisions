Obstacle 338 shows a concerning trajectory.  Its position is very close to the ego vehicle and although its velocity decreases rapidly and becomes almost stationary, its initial proximity and the ego vehicle's own deceleration raise concerns about a potential collision in the very near future.

Obstacle 33 also shows some level of risk. While not immediately threatening a collision, it is relatively close to the ego vehicle and its velocity and acceleration fluctuate, making its future trajectory somewhat unpredictable. It warrants close monitoring.

Obstacle 337 is moving relatively fast but its trajectory appears to be diverging from the ego vehicle's path, lessening the immediate risk.

Obstacles 319 and 345 do not pose any immediate risk due to their positions and velocities.
