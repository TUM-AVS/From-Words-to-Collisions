Obstacle 338 shows a concerning trajectory.  Its initial velocity is close to the ego vehicle's but decelerates rapidly over the subsequent timesteps, nearly stopping completely. Its lateral position also places it very close to the ego vehicle and in a neighboring lanelet (38387) which suggests possible lane change interaction. While a collision hasn't happened yet, the rapid deceleration and proximity warrant a high risk assessment.
