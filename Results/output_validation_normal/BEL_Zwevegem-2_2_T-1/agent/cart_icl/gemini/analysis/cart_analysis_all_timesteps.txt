At t=0.9s, the ego vehicle's position is (907.8224, -340.6334) with a velocity of 0.6981 and acceleration of -0.3941.  Let's analyze each obstacle:

* **Obstacle 33:** Located at (902.78636, -337.10048), this obstacle poses minimal risk. While laterally close, it's moving away from the ego vehicle.  Risk: **Negligible (5)**.

* **Obstacle 319:** Stationary and far from the ego vehicle. Risk: **Negligible (5)**.

* **Obstacle 337:**  Located at (934.75587, -347.75839). Requires further examination due to higher velocity (7.8019) and lateral proximity. Though its acceleration is negative (-3.0520), its current trajectory warrants closer monitoring. Risk: **Medium (3)** due to the combination of lateral proximity, ego's decreasing velocity, and obstacle's higher velocity, despite negative acceleration.

* **Obstacle 338:** Stationary and slightly behind the ego vehicle. Minimal lateral offset.  Risk: **Low (4)**.

* **Obstacle 345:** Positioned at (878.26975, -342.55683) and moving with a velocity of 10.3474. This obstacle is behind and to the left of the ego vehicle, but its high speed and the ego vehicle's deceleration require further analysis. Though there is lateral separation currently, the different trajectories and velocities raise some concern. Risk: **Medium (3)** due to high velocity, lateral proximity and opposite direction.
