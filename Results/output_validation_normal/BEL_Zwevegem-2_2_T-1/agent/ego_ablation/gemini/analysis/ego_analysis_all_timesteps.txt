At t=0.9s, Obstacle 33 is closest to the ego vehicle longitudinally at 1.62m, but its longitudinal velocity is now positive at 0.1 m/s, indicating it is moving away from the ego vehicle.  Laterally, it remains aligned with the ego vehicle (0.0m lateral distance). Though the distance is small, the positive longitudinal velocity suggests the risk is decreasing.

Obstacle 338 is laterally close at 1.88m, but it is not moving longitudinally and its lateral velocity is also zero, implying low risk.

All other obstacles are moving away from the ego vehicle both longitudinally and laterally.
