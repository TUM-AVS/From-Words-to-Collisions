Obstacle 33 is moving away longitudinally from the ego vehicle, and is at a lateral distance of 0.0. With a longitudinal distance of 1.62m, it represents a potential collision risk in the near future if the current motion trend continues.

Obstacle 337 is moving away from the ego vehicle both longitudinally and laterally, posing no immediate risk.

Obstacle 338 is almost stationary relative to the ego vehicle longitudinally, and at a lateral distance of 1.88m, posing no immediate risk.

Obstacle 345 is moving towards the ego vehicle longitudinally and away laterally. Although the longitudinal distance is 16.89m, the continuous approach might pose a risk if the lateral movement isn't sufficient to avoid a future collision.
