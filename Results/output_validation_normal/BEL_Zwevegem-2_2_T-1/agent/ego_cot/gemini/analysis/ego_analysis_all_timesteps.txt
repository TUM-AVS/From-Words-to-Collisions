### Safety analysis for timestep 0.9 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 33**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 33 is located in front of the ego vehicle with a small longitudinal distance (1.62m) suggesting a high risk of frontal collision.  Lateral distance is also minimal (1.62m), indicating potential for a non-centered impact. While the longitudinal velocity suggests the obstacle is *currently* moving away, it is still very close and previous time steps indicate closing behavior, so the risk remains high.
- Distance safety score: 2
- Time Risk reason: The recent change in longitudinal velocity direction makes TTC calculation unreliable. The close proximity and history of approach represent a near-term collision risk even if momentarily diverging.
- Time safety score: 2
- Overall Risk score: 2

- **Obstacle ID: 319**
- Distance Risk reason: Located far behind the ego vehicle and moving away. No collision risk.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason:  Moving away from the ego vehicle, poses no risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 337**
- Distance Risk reason: Located far behind the ego vehicle and moving away.  Poses no risk.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Moving away from the ego vehicle, poses no risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 338**
- Distance Risk reason:  Zero longitudinal and lateral distance indicates a collision or extremely close proximity has occurred. The history shows consistent near-zero distances, indicating this obstacle is likely alongside the ego vehicle.
- Distance safety score: 2
- Time Risk reason: While currently showing slight longitudinal separation, the zero distance at previous timesteps and consistently near-zero values suggests a high risk of collision, especially given the lateral movement.
- Time safety score: 2
- Overall Risk score: 2

- **Obstacle ID: 345**
- Distance Risk reason:  Obstacle is relatively far ahead and to the left. The lateral movement is diverging. Low risk.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason:  While the longitudinal velocity indicates closing, the lateral velocity is rapidly diverging, reducing collision risk.  
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4
