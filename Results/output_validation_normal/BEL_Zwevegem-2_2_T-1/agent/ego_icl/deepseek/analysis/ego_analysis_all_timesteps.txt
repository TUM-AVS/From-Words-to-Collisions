Let me analyze each obstacle at the most recent timestep (0.9 seconds):

1. Obstacle 33 (Front):
   - Longitudinal distance: 1.62m (stable/slightly increasing)
   - Lateral distance: 0.00m (aligned)
   - Relative velocity: +0.10m/s (moving away longitudinally)
   - TTC: Not applicable (positive relative velocity)
   - MDC: 1.62m (Medium Risk)
   - Note: Initially approaching but now moving away, same-lane alignment but no collision risk

2. Obstacle 337 (Rear-right):
   - Longitudinal distance: -20.70m (increasing)
   - Lateral distance: -10.25m (increasing)
   - Relative velocities: -2.22m/s (long), -7.65m/s (lat) - both moving away
   - TTC: Not applicable (negative relative velocities)
   - MDC: >10m (No Risk)
   - Note: Moving away in both dimensions

3. Obstacle 338 (Left):
   - Longitudinal distance: 0.00m (aligned)
   - Lateral distance: 1.88m (stable)
   - Relative velocity: -0.70m/s (long), -0.00m/s (lat)
   - TTC: Not applicable (no closing velocity)
   - MDC: 1.88m (Medium Risk)
   - Note: Side-by-side alignment but stable lateral distance

4. Obstacle 345 (Front-left):
   - Longitudinal distance: 16.89m
   - Lateral distance: 18.86m
   - Relative velocity: -1.55m/s (long), +10.31m/s (lat)
   - TTC: Not applicable (lateral distance increasing)
   - MDC: >16m (No Risk)
   - Note: Moving away diagonally

JSON Summary:
{
    "CollisionObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": null,

    },
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {

}

Analysis:
- No obstacles currently at collision (0), extreme (1), or high (2) risk levels
- Obstacles 33 and 338 are at Medium Risk (3) due to alignment but stable/increasing distances
- All other obstacles are Low or No Risk
- The situation appears stable with no imminent collision threats
