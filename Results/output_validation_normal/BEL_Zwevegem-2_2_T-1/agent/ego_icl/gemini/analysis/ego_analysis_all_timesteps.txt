* **Obstacle 33:** This obstacle is directly in front of the ego vehicle (lateral distance = 0.00m) and has been approaching over the past timesteps. At the last timestep, the longitudinal distance is 1.62m.  The longitudinal relative velocity is now positive (0.10 m/s), meaning it's *moving away* longitudinally. While proximity is high, the diverging trajectory indicates decreasing risk.  
    * MDC: ~1.62m (Medium Risk)
    * TTC: Not applicable as objects are moving apart longitudinally. 
    * Overall Risk: 3 (Medium Risk) - based on proximity

* **Obstacle 319:** This obstacle is far behind and to the right of the ego vehicle, with distances increasing at each timestep. It poses no risk.
    * Risk: 5 (Negligible Risk)

* **Obstacle 337:**  Located behind and to the right, this obstacle is moving further away in both directions with each timestep.
    * Risk: 5 (Negligible Risk)

* **Obstacle 338:** Situated to the left of the ego vehicle, this obstacle has maintained a near-constant lateral distance of approximately 1.85-1.88 meters over the last few timesteps.  At t=0.9s, the longitudinal distance is 0.00m and lateral distance is 1.88m.  The relative longitudinal velocity is negative (-0.70 m/s), indicating separation.
    * MDC: ~1.88m (Medium Risk)
    * TTC: Not applicable as the objects are moving apart longitudinally.
    * Overall Risk: 3 (Medium Risk) - based on proximity

* **Obstacle 345:** This obstacle is diagonally ahead and to the left, with a lateral distance increasing but longitudinal distance decreasing over time. It's moving away laterally but towards the ego longitudinally.  At t=0.9s, longitudinal distance is 16.89m and lateral distance is 18.86m. Relative longitudinal velocity is -1.55 m/s meaning it is moving away.
    * MDC: ~16.89m (Low risk)
    * TTC:  Not applicable as objects are moving apart longitudinally.
    * Overall Risk: 4 (Low Risk) - based on comfortable distance
