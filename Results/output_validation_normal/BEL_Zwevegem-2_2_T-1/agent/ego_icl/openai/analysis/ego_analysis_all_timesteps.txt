### Obstacle-by-Obstacle Analysis

#### Obstacle 33 (Front)
- **Position & Motion:**
  - Longitudinal distance: 1.62 m, Lateral distance: 0.00 m
  - Relative velocity: Longitudinal 0.10 m/s, Lateral 0.13 m/s
  - Motion suggests the obstacle is moving away longitudinally with exact lateral alignment.
- **Trajectory Analysis:**
  - Longitudinal distance is decreasing, but now the relative velocity is positive indicating moving away.
  - There is exact lateral alignment.
- **TTC & MDC Calculation:**
  - **TTC Longitudinal:** Not a concern due to positive relative velocity.
  - **MDC Longitudinal:** 1.62 m (since velocities are now diverging)
  - **TTC/MDC Summary:** No immediate risk due to increasing longitudinal gap.
- **Risk Analysis:**
  - While aligned, the obstacle is starting to move away, making the risk minimal.
  - **Overall Risk Score:** 4 (Low Risk)

#### Obstacle 337 (Rear-right)
- **Position & Motion:**
  - Longitudinal distance: -20.70 m, Lateral distance: -10.25 m
  - Relative velocity: Longitudinal -2.22 m/s, Lateral -7.65 m/s
  - Motion indicates the obstacle is moving away both longitudinally and laterally.
- **Trajectory Analysis:**
  - Distances in both dimensions are increasing.
- **TTC & MDC Calculation:**
  - No TTC as velocities indicate divergence.
  - No immediate collision due to increasing distance.
  - **MDC Lateral:** Increase from prior readings, indicating divergence.
- **Risk Analysis:**
  - No risk of collision due to clear diverging paths.
  - **Overall Risk Score:** 5 (No Risk)

#### Obstacle 338 (Left)
- **Position & Motion:**
  - Longitudinal distance: 0.00 m, Lateral distance: 1.88 m
  - Relative velocity: Longitudinal -0.70 m/s, Lateral 0.00 m/s
  - Motion describes exact longitudinal alignment with no lateral relative motion.
- **Trajectory Analysis:**
  - The lateral distance is decreasing slowly.
- **TTC & MDC Calculation:**
  - **TTC Lateral:** No meaningful TTC due to minimal change.
  - **MDC Lateral:** 1.88 m (stable with minimal interaction).
- **Risk Analysis:**
  - No significant change indicating collision risk.
  - **Overall Risk Score:** 5 (No Risk)

#### Obstacle 345 (Front-left)
- **Position & Motion:**
  - Longitudinal distance: 16.89 m, Lateral distance: 18.86 m
  - Relative velocity: Longitudinal -1.55 m/s, Lateral 10.31 m/s
  - Motion indicates the obstacle is driving toward the ego vehicle longitudinally at a decreasing rate but moving away laterally.
- **Trajectory Analysis:**
  - Continuous divergence laterally.
- **TTC & MDC Calculation:**
  - **TTC Longitudinal:** Approx. 10.9 seconds (Low immediate concern)
  - **MDC Longitudinal/Lateral:** No close convergence for collision.
- **Risk Analysis:**
  - Diverging laterally reduces collision potential significantly.
  - **Overall Risk Score:** 5 (No Risk)
