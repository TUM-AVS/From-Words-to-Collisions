At t=0.9s, Ego is in lanelet 38386.0 and decelerating. Let's analyze the obstacles:

* **Obstacle 33:** Located in lanelet 39678.0, moving slowly and away from Ego. No immediate risk.
* **Obstacle 319:** Stationary and far from Ego. No risk.
* **Obstacle 337:**  Located in lanelet 39680.0, moving quickly but away from Ego. No immediate risk.
* **Obstacle 338:** Located in lanelet 38387.0, nearly stationary and very close to Ego.  Given Ego's deceleration, a collision is not imminent in the next immediate timestep, but the proximity and opposing lanes suggest a high risk.
* **Obstacle 345:** Located in lanelet 39675.0 and moving quickly but far from Ego. No immediate risk.
