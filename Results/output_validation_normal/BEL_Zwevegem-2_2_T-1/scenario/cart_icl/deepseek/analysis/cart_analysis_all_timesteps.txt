### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep (0.9 seconds):

### Obstacle Analysis:

1. **Obstacle ID: 33.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Position (902.78636, -337.10048) is ~5.5m away from ego (907.8224, -340.6334). Moving towards ego but lateral distance is significant.
   - **Distance safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: Velocity (0.8069 m/s) is low and decelerating. Relative velocity is minimal.
   - **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 3 (Medium Risk)

2. **Obstacle ID: 319.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Static at (938.17857, -339.03396), ~30m away from ego. No collision risk.
   - **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: Velocity = 0 m/s.
   - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)

3. **Obstacle ID: 337.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Position (934.75587, -347.75839) is ~27m away from ego. Moving away laterally.
   - **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: High velocity (7.8 m/s) but moving away from ego.
   - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)

4. **Obstacle ID: 338.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Position (907.56238, -344.97037) is ~3.4m away from ego (closest obstacle). Static after deceleration.
   - **Distance safety score**: 2 (High Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: Velocity = 0 m/s (stopped). No immediate collision.
   - **Time safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 2 (High Risk)

5. **Obstacle ID: 345.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Position (878.26975, -342.55683) is ~30m away from ego. Moving away longitudinally.
   - **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: High velocity (10.35 m/s) but moving away.
   - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. Ego is decelerating (velocity = 0.6981 m/s) and no obstacles are on a direct collision path.
2. Obstacle 338.0 is the closest (~3.4m) but has stopped moving (velocity = 0 m/s).
3. Other obstacles are either static or moving away from ego.
4. No immediate collision risk, but Obstacle 338.0 requires monitoring due to proximity.
