- Time Risk reason: High velocity, warrants monitoring for lane change behavior.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4
- Obstacle ID: 348
- Distance Risk reason: Not in the same lane.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Moving away.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5
- Obstacle ID: 351
- Distance Risk reason:  Far from ego and in a different lane.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: No immediate risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
No immediate collisions. Obstacle 338 poses the highest risk due to proximity and recent trajectory, but it appears to be decelerating and not directly on a collision course at the most recent timestep. Other obstacles are either stationary, far away, or in different lanes, posing less immediate risk. However, the high velocities of obstacles 337 and 345 require continuous monitoring. This is not a collision scenario.

### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
  "CollisionObstacles": null,
  "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null,
  "ScenarioAnalysis": {
    "IsCollisionScenario": false,
    "Reasoning": "No obstacle has a risk score of 0 at the most recent timestep. Although obstacle 338 is close, it is not currently on a collision course."
  }
