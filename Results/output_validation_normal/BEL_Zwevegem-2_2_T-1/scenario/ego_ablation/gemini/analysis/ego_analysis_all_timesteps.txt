Obstacle 33 shows a longitudinal distance of 1.62m and a relative longitudinal velocity of 0.10 m/s (moving away). While the distance is close, the obstacle is moving away, reducing immediate risk. It requires monitoring but doesn't pose an extreme risk currently.

Obstacle 338 is at a lateral distance of 1.88m, showing no immediate lateral motion (0.00 m/s). The moderate distance combined with the lack of immediate lateral movement makes it a lower risk at this specific timestep.

        "Reasoning": "No obstacle presents an immediate collision risk in the most recent timestep. Obstacle 33 is close longitudinally but moving away. Obstacle 338 is moderately close laterally but not currently moving towards the ego vehicle. All other obstacles are moving away or at safe distances."
