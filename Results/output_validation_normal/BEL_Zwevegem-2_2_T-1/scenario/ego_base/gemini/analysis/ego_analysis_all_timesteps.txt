At t=0.9s, Obstacle 33 is closest to the ego vehicle longitudinally (1.62m) and its longitudinal relative velocity has become positive (0.10 m/s), suggesting it might be starting to move away. However, further observation is needed to ascertain this definitively. It poses the highest risk, though not yet a collision.  Obstacle 338 is laterally very close (1.88m) but maintains a safe longitudinal distance of 0.0m with a slightly negative longitudinal relative velocity, lessening immediate concern. Obstacle 337 and 345 are moving away and do not pose an immediate threat.
