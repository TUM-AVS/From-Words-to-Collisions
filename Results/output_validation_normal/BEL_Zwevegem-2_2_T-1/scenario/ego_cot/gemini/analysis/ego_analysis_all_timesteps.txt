### Safety analysis for timestep 0.9 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 33**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 33 is located in front of the ego vehicle at a very close longitudinal and lateral distance (1.62m in both directions). This close proximity indicates a high risk of collision.
- Distance safety score: 1 (Extreme Risk)
- Time Risk reason: While the longitudinal relative velocity is slightly positive (0.10 m/s), indicating that the obstacle might be moving slightly away longitudinally, the distance is so small that even this slight movement doesn't alleviate the extreme risk.  A slight change in velocity or trajectory could easily result in a collision. Plus, the lateral movement (0.13 m/s) further exacerbates the risk.
- Time safety score: 1 (Extreme Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 1 (Extreme Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 319**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 319 is located behind and to the right of the ego vehicle at a safe distance and is moving away.
- Distance safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- Time Risk reason: The obstacle is moving away longitudinally and there's no lateral relative motion, further confirming no risk of collision.
- Time safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 5 (Negligible Risk)


- **Obstacle ID: 337**
- Distance Risk reason: Located far behind and to the right of the ego vehicle and moving further away.
- Distance safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- Time Risk reason: The negative relative velocities (both longitudinal and lateral) indicate the obstacle is moving away from the ego vehicle, posing no risk.
- Time safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 5 (Negligible Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 338**
- Distance Risk reason: Although the reported distance is 0.00 m, implying a collision, the "Motion" description indicates it is moving away laterally. Likely, this obstacle is alongside and just passed the ego vehicle, hence the 0.00 m distance.
- Distance safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
- Time Risk reason: The negative longitudinal velocity suggests the obstacle is slightly behind or just passing the ego vehicle longitudinally as well. The lateral movement away further decreases the risk.
- Time safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 4 (Low Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 345**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 345 is far ahead and to the left. Although the longitudinal distance might appear concerning at 16.89m when considering future motion, the lateral movement to the left is substantial.
- Distance safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
- Time Risk reason: Negative longitudinal velocity indicates the obstacle is approaching the ego vehicle longitudinally. However, positive lateral velocity shows it is moving away laterally, significantly mitigating the risk.
- Time safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 4 (Low Risk)


### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
    "CollisionObstacle": null,
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "33",
        "OverallRiskScore": "1"
    },
    "IsCollisionScenario": false,
    "Justification": "Obstacle 33 poses an extreme risk due to its very close proximity to the ego vehicle, despite the slight positive longitudinal relative velocity.  However, it's not a definite collision at this instant, making it an extreme risk rather than a certain collision."
