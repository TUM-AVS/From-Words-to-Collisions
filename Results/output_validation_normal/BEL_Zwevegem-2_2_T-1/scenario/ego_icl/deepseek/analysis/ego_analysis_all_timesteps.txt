Let me analyze each obstacle at the most recent timestep (0.9 seconds) and assess collision risks:

1. **Obstacle 33 (Front)**
   - Position: longitudinal 1.62m, lateral 0.00m (exact alignment)
   - Relative velocity: longitudinal +0.10 m/s (moving away), lateral +0.13 m/s
   - Motion: Moving away longitudinally, exact lateral alignment
   - Analysis: 
     - MDC (lateral): 0.00m but trajectories diverging (lateral velocity positive)
     - TTC: Not applicable (moving away)
     - Risk: 5 (No Risk) - Moving away in both dimensions

2. **Obstacle 337 (Rear-right)**
   - Position: longitudinal -20.70m, lateral -10.25m
   - Relative velocity: longitudinal -2.22 m/s, lateral -7.65 m/s (both moving away)
   - Motion: Moving away in both dimensions
   - Analysis:
     - MDC: >5m in both dimensions
     - TTC: Not applicable (moving away)
     - Risk: 5 (No Risk)

3. **Obstacle 338 (Left)**
   - Position: longitudinal 0.00m (exact alignment), lateral 1.88m
   - Relative velocity: longitudinal -0.70 m/s, lateral -0.00 m/s
   - Motion: Exact longitudinal alignment, no lateral motion
   - Analysis:
     - MDC (longitudinal): 0.00m but stable (no closing velocity)
     - TTC: Not applicable (no closing velocity)
     - Risk: 5 (No Risk) - No convergence

4. **Obstacle 345 (Front-left)**
   - Position: longitudinal 16.89m, lateral 18.86m
   - Relative velocity: longitudinal -1.55 m/s, lateral +10.31 m/s
   - Motion: Approaching longitudinally, moving away laterally
   - Analysis:
     - MDC: >5m in both dimensions
     - TTC longitudinal: 16.89/1.55 = 10.9s (No Risk)
     - Risk: 5 (No Risk)

**Trajectory Analysis:**
- Obstacle 33 was approaching but now moving away (risk decreasing)
- All other obstacles are either stationary relative to ego or moving away
- No obstacles show converging trajectories at dangerous distances

**Collision Scenario Determination:**
- No obstacles have risk score 0 or 1
- All obstacles are either moving away or at safe distances
- No imminent collision threats

    "CollisionObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "None",

    },
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "None",
        "OverallRiskScore": "None"
    },
    "IsCollisionScenario": false,
    "Justification": "No obstacles show collision (0) or extreme risk (1) conditions. All obstacles are either moving away or maintaining safe distances with non-converging trajectories."
}
