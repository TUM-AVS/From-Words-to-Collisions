* **Obstacle 33:** This obstacle is directly in front of the ego vehicle (lateral distance = 0.00m) and has been approaching over the observed timesteps. At the last timestep (0.9s), the longitudinal distance is 1.62m. Although it appears to be slightly moving away longitudinally (0.10 m/s), the small positive velocity combined with the very close proximity suggests a possible rebound after a near collision or a sensor error.  The consistent approach across previous timesteps and the near-zero lateral distance warrants an extremely high risk assessment despite the momentary positive velocity. The MDC is effectively 0m (due to lateral alignment) and TTC is 16.2s (distance/velocity). However, due to the close proximity, consistent previous approach, and the possibility of a sensor error, we override the TTC calculation and assign an **Extreme Risk (1)**.

* **Obstacle 319:**  This obstacle is far behind and to the right of the ego vehicle and moving further away in both directions across all timesteps. There is no risk of collision. **No Risk (5)**.

* **Obstacle 337:** This obstacle is behind and to the right of the ego, moving further away. It poses no collision risk. **No Risk (5)**.

* **Obstacle 338:** This obstacle is directly to the left of the ego vehicle (longitudinal distance = 0.00m). At 0.9s, the lateral distance is 1.88m. Although the lateral relative velocity is near zero, and the recent trend shows the obstacle is moving away, the near-zero longitudinal distance makes this a situation that requires close monitoring.  MDC is approximately 1.88m. TTC calculation is not reliable due to the near-zero relative velocity. Given the close proximity and the sustained alignment throughout most of the observed duration, we classify this as **Medium Risk (3)**. 

* **Obstacle 345:** This obstacle is diagonally in front and to the left of the ego vehicle. It's moving towards the ego longitudinally, but away laterally. At 0.9s, it's approximately 16.89m ahead longitudinally and 18.86m to the left laterally. These distances and the diverging lateral trajectory indicate no immediate collision risk. Using the smaller longitudinal distance and its corresponding velocity for a conservative TTC estimate (16.89m / 1.55 m/s â‰ˆ 10.9s) suggests no risk. MDC is also large due to the lateral separation. Therefore, the risk is assessed as **No Risk (5)**.

**Conclusion:** Obstacle 33 poses an Extreme Risk (1) due to its very close proximity, its direct approach over multiple prior timestamps, and the possibility of a sensor glitch or rebound after a near collision. Therefore, this is classified as a collision scenario.
