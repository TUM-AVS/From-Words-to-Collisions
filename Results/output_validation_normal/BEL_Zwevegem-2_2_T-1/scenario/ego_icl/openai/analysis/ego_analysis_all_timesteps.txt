Given the context provided, we'll analyze the risk of collision for each obstacle, focusing on the most recent timestep (0.9 seconds) and using the adjusted distances for accuracy.

### Obstacle-by-Obstacle Analysis:

#### **Obstacle 33:**
- **Position (most recent):** Front
- **Adjusted Longitudinal Distance:** 1.62 m
- **Adjusted Lateral Distance:** 0.00 m
- **Relative Velocity (longitudinal/lateral):** 0.10 m/s / 0.13 m/s
- **Relative Acceleration (longitudinal/lateral):** -1.91 m/s² / 1.21 m/s²
- **Motion:** Moving away longitudinally. Exact lateral alignment or unknown.
  
**Trajectory Analysis:**
- **TTC Calculation:** TTC_long = 1.62 m / 0.10 m/s = 16.2s (Obstacle moving away, TTC isn't applicable for collisions as it's positive.)
- **MDC Calculation:** MDC = 1.62 m (based on longitudinal direction since lateral distance = 0 due to alignment)

**Risk Assessment:**
- Given the longitudinal distance (1.62m) and positive relative velocity, no collision is currently occurring, nor is it imminent.
- **Risk Score:** 3 (Medium Risk), as TTC doesn't indicate immediate collision but requires monitoring due to close proximity.

#### **Obstacle 319:**
- **Position (most recent):** Rear-right
- **Adjusted Longitudinal Distance:** -17.70 m
- **Adjusted Lateral Distance:** -10.25 m
- **Relative Velocity (longitudinal/lateral):** -2.22 m/s / -7.65 m/s
- **Motion:** Moving away longitudinally and laterally.

**Trajectory Analysis:**
- **TTC and MDC:** Not applicable since both distances are negative, indicating the obstacle is behind and moving away from the ego vehicle.
- **Risk Score:** 5 (No Risk)

#### **Obstacle 337:**
- **Position (most recent):** Rear-right
- **Adjusted Longitudinal Distance:** -20.70 m
- **Adjusted Lateral Distance:** -10.25 m
- **Relative Velocity (longitudinal/lateral):** -2.22 m/s / -7.65 m/s
- **Motion:** Moving away longitudinally and laterally.

**Trajectory Analysis:**
- **TTC and MDC:** Not applicable, as both distances are negative, indicating the obstacle is behind and moving away.
- **Risk Score:** 5 (No Risk)

#### **Obstacle 338:**
- **Position (most recent):** Left
- **Adjusted Longitudinal Distance:** 0.00 m
- **Adjusted Lateral Distance:** 1.88 m
- **Relative Velocity (longitudinal/lateral):** -0.70 m/s / 0.00 m/s
- **Motion:** No lateral movement, exact longitudinal alignment.

**Trajectory Analysis:**
- **TTC and MDC:** 
  - Since there's no lateral velocity component, lateral TTC isn't applicable.
  - MDC = 1.88 m (lateral distance, as longitudinal distance alignment doesn't impact directly)
- **Risk Score:** 3 (Medium Risk), due to close lateral proximity but stable relative position.

#### **Obstacle 345:**
- **Position (most recent):** Front-left
- **Adjusted Longitudinal Distance:** 16.89 m
- **Adjusted Lateral Distance:** 18.86 m
- **Relative Velocity (longitudinal/lateral):** -1.55 m/s / 10.31 m/s
- **Motion:** Driving toward the ego car longitudinally, moving away laterally.

**Trajectory Analysis:**
- **TTC Calculation (longitudinal):** TTC_long = 16.89 m / 1.55 m/s = ~10.9s
- **MDC Calculation:** MDC > 5 m, given large initial distances in both directions.
- **Risk Score:** 5 (No Risk), as the obstacle is moving away laterally.

### Conclusion
- No obstacle is currently colliding with the ego vehicle.
- **Collision Scenario:** False
- **Justification:** Obstacle 33, having the closest proximity, is not at immediate risk of collision based on positive relative velocity and timing. Other obstacles are either moving away or too distant.
