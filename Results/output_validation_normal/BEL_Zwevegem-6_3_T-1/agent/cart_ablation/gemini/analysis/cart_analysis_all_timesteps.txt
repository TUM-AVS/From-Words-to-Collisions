Obstacle 391 is in the same lane as the ego vehicle (lanelet 41197) and is moving slower than the ego vehicle. The distance between them is decreasing over time. Although a collision hasn't occurred yet, the continuous approach and speed difference suggest a high risk of collision if the ego vehicle doesn't decelerate or change lanes.  Obstacle 383 is in a different lanelet (41693) than the ego vehicle initially (41197). However, the ego vehicle changes to lanelet 41693 between 0.5 and 0.6 seconds. Obstacle 383 is moving at a relatively high speed in this lanelet. There is a risk associated with this lane change maneuver given the proximity and speed of obstacle 383 which needs further observation. Obstacle 375 remains essentially stationary and poses no immediate threat. Obstacle 35 is also stationary and far from the ego vehicle, posing no risk.
