Obstacle 391 is in the same lane as the Ego vehicle (41197) and is moving slower than the Ego vehicle. While Obstacle 391 is accelerating, the Ego vehicle is decelerating significantly.  This creates a high risk of a rear-end collision. The distance between them is decreasing over time.

Obstacle 383 is in a different lane (41693) but at timestep 0.6, the Ego vehicle changes to lane 41693 where Obstacle 383 is. Both are moving at considerable speeds. The distance between the two is decreasing. Therefore this obstacle poses a high risk.

Obstacle 375 is in a different lane (41094) and is essentially stationary.  It does not pose a collision risk.

Obstacle 35 is in a different lane (41061) and is stationary. It does not pose a collision risk.
