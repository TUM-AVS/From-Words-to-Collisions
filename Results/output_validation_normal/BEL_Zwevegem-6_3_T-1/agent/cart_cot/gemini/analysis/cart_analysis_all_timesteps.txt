At t=0.9s, the ego vehicle is at (440.184, -590.5743) with a velocity of 7.2873 and acceleration of -0.0078.  Let's analyze the risk posed by each obstacle at this timestep:

* **Obstacle 35:** Located at (432.23737, -564.05277), stationary.  Poses no immediate threat due to significant lateral and longitudinal separation.  Risk Score: 5 (Negligible Risk)

* **Obstacle 375:** Located at (456.06752, -599.29844), almost stationary.  While there's considerable longitudinal separation, the lateral distance is smaller. However, given its minimal velocity and the ego vehicle's deceleration, the risk remains low. Risk Score: 4 (Low Risk)

* **Obstacle 383:** Located at (447.06301, -583.89044), velocity 10.034623, acceleration 1.1208075 and located in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle. This obstacle is the most concerning. It's relatively close, moving faster than the ego vehicle, and accelerating, all within the same lanelet. This suggests a potential closing velocity, increasing the risk of a collision in the near future. While not an immediate collision, the risk is high enough to warrant attention. Risk Score: 2 (High Risk)

* **Obstacle 391:** Located at (428.30919, -602.54324), velocity 8.9192418 and acceleration 1.233536. While this obstacle shares the same lanelet as the ego vehicle, it's located behind the ego vehicle and moving slower. Based on the provided data, even with its acceleration, a collision is unlikely.  Risk Score: 4 (Low Risk)

**Detailed Reasoning for Obstacle 383 (High Risk):**

The combination of proximity, higher velocity, and acceleration for Obstacle 383 makes it the most significant risk.  The lateral distance is small indicating they are in close proximity within the same lane. The fact that Obstacle 383 is accelerating while the ego vehicle is decelerating creates a closing velocity that increases the risk of collision. While a collision isn't imminent at this specific timestep, it is very likely if these trends continue. Therefore, it necessitates a high-risk assessment, prompting the autonomous driving system to take proactive measures to mitigate potential collision.
