### Analysis:

1. **Obstacle 375.0**:  
   - Position: (456.06752, -599.29844)  
   - Velocity: ~0.0 m/s (stationary)  
   - Distance from Ego: ~16.0m  
   - Orientation: Opposite to Ego  
   - **Risk**: Negligible (5) - Far away and stationary, no immediate threat.

2. **Obstacle 383.0**:  
   - Position: (447.06301, -583.89044)  
   - Velocity: 10.03 m/s (similar direction to Ego)  
   - Distance from Ego: ~7.0m (lateral distance ~6.7m)  
   - Orientation: Similar to Ego  
   - **Risk**: Low (4) - Moving in the same direction but with sufficient lateral separation.

3. **Obstacle 391.0**:  
   - Position: (428.30919, -602.54324)  
   - Velocity: 8.92 m/s (similar direction to Ego)  
   - Distance from Ego: ~8.5m (behind Ego)  
   - Orientation: Similar to Ego  
   - **Risk**: Medium (3) - Approaching from behind but with manageable distance and speed difference.

4. **Obstacle 35.0**:  
   - Position: (432.23737, -564.05277)  
   - Velocity: 0.0 m/s (stationary)  
   - Distance from Ego: ~28.0m  
   - Orientation: Opposite to Ego  
   - **Risk**: Negligible (5) - Far away and stationary, no immediate threat.

### Key Observations:
- No obstacles pose an immediate collision risk (TTC > 0, MDC sufficient).
- Obstacle 383.0 and 391.0 are the closest but have manageable trajectories.
