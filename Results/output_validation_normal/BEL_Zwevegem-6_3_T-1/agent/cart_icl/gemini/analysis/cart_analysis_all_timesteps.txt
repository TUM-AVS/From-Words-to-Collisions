At t=0.9s, the ego vehicle is at (440.184, -590.5743) with a velocity of 7.2873 m/s and an orientation of 0.773376 rad. Let's analyze the risk posed by each obstacle:

* **Obstacle 35:** Stationary and far from the ego vehicle (laterally and longitudinally). Negligible risk.

* **Obstacle 375:**  Almost stationary and laterally separated from the ego vehicle in a different lanelet.  Negligible risk.

* **Obstacle 383:** Located at (447.06301, -583.89044) with a velocity of 10.034623 m/s.  It's in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle (41693) and moving faster. The relative velocity is approximately 2.75 m/s.  The x-coordinate difference is about 6.88m while the y-coordinate shows a lateral offset of approximately 6.68 meters. Since the y-coordinate difference is substantial despite being in the same lanelet, this suggests Obstacle 383 is likely in an adjacent lane within the same lanelet. Given the speeds and distances, Obstacle 383 is likely overtaking the ego vehicle, and a lane change by the ego vehicle towards Obstacle 383's lane would pose a risk.  We consider this a medium risk due to the significant lateral distance, giving the ego vehicle time to react.

* **Obstacle 391:** Located at (428.30919, -602.54324) with a velocity of 8.9192418 m/s. It's in a different lanelet (41197) although the absolute y-coordinate difference isn't large, hence likely in an adjacent parallel lane.  The x-coordinate difference is about -11.87 indicating Obstacle 391 is behind. Obstacle 391 is moving slightly faster than the ego vehicle and gradually closing the gap. The combination of lane difference and relative motion suggests a low risk.
