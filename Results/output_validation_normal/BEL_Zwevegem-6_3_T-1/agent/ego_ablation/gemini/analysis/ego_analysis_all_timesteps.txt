Obstacle 375 shows an extremely high risk of collision. At the last timestep (0.9 seconds), it is only 0.76 meters in front of the ego vehicle longitudinally and although it is moving to the right laterally, it is still at a concerning distance of -15.73 meters. This close longitudinal proximity combined with its negative relative velocity (-7.29 m/s) indicates that it is rapidly approaching the ego vehicle. The minimal relative acceleration suggests that this velocity is unlikely to change significantly in the immediate future.  This poses a serious and immediate danger.
