### Safety analysis for timestep 0.9s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

**Assumptions and Clarifications:**

* **Missing Adjusted Distances:** The provided scenario lacks adjusted distances (adjusted_d_long and adjusted_d_lat).  This is crucial for accurate TTC and MDC calculations.  I will proceed with the analysis using the provided *real* distances (DTClong, DTClat), but the results will be less reliable.  **You MUST provide adjusted distances for a proper safety assessment.**
* **TTC Calculation:** I will use a simplified TTC calculation: `TTC = Distance / Relative Velocity`. This doesn't account for acceleration, which is important for a complete analysis.
* **Lateral TTC:**  A true lateral TTC is complex.  I will approximate it using the provided lateral distance and velocity, but this assumes straight-line movement, which isn't always realistic.

### Obstacle Analysis:

**- Obstacle ID: 35**
- Distance Risk reason:  Located 8.33m longitudinally and laterally in the front-left.  Presents low risk due to the significant distance.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: TTClong = 8.33m / 7.29m/s ≈ 1.14s. The substantial time to collision longitudinally indicates low risk.  Lateral movement is negligible.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

**- Obstacle ID: 375**
- Distance Risk reason: Located 0.76m longitudinally and laterally in the front-right.  Extremely high risk due to the close proximity.
- Distance safety score: 1
- Time Risk reason: TTClong = 0.76m / 7.29m/s ≈ 0.1s.  The very short time to collision longitudinally indicates extreme risk. Lateral movement is away from the ego vehicle, slightly reducing risk.
- Time safety score: 1
- Overall Risk score: 1

**- Obstacle ID: 383**
- Distance Risk reason: Located 5.08m longitudinally and laterally in front.  Relatively safe distance.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Obstacle is moving away longitudinally (Vrel_long = 2.75 m/s).  No collision risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 4


**- Obstacle ID: 391**
- Distance Risk reason: Located 12.35m longitudinally behind.  Safe distance.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Although approaching the ego vehicle from behind, the distance and relative velocity suggest ample time to react. TTC = 12.35m / 1.63m/s ≈ 7.58s
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4
