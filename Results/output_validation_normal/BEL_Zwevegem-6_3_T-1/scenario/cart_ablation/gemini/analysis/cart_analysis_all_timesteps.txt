At t=0.9s, Ego is in lanelet 41693.

Obstacle 383 is also in lanelet 41693, traveling at a higher speed (10.03 m/s vs 7.29 m/s) and slightly ahead of the Ego vehicle (447.06, -583.89 vs 440.18, -590.57).  Given their close proximity and same lanelet, combined with the speed differential, an extreme risk of collision exists.

Obstacle 391 is in lanelet 41197, and though approaching the intersection with lanelet 41693 where Ego is located, it does not pose an immediate collision risk at this timestep.

Obstacle 375 and 35 are located in different lanelets and are far enough away to not pose an immediate threat.
