At t=0.9s, Ego is in lanelet 41693.

Obstacle 383 is also in lanelet 41693, traveling at 10.03 m/s while Ego is traveling at 7.29 m/s.  The positions are (440.184, -590.5743) for Ego and (447.06301, -583.89044) for Obstacle 383. While Obstacle 383 is ahead of Ego, the y-coordinates indicate they are converging and the difference in x position is not large enough to rule out a collision, especially given the velocity difference. This poses an extreme risk.

Obstacle 391 is in lanelet 41197, with position (428.30919, -602.54324). This obstacle does not present an immediate risk. Obstacle 375 and 35 pose no risk due to their positions and near-zero velocities.
