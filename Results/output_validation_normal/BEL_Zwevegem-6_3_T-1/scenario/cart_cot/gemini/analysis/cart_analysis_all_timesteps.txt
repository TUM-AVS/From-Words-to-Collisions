### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 35
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 35 is located in a different lanelet and far from the ego vehicle, posing no immediate risk.  Its static position over the observed time confirms its lack of threat.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: The obstacle is stationary, eliminating any time-related collision risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5
- Obstacle ID: 375
- Distance Risk reason:  Obstacle 375 is located in a different lanelet and maintains a significant lateral distance from the ego vehicle throughout the scenario. Its minimal velocity further reduces the risk.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: The obstacle's near-zero velocity and consistent position over time indicate no risk of collision in the foreseeable future.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5
- Obstacle ID: 383
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 383 is initially in a different lanelet but the ego vehicle changes lanelet from 41197.0 to 41693.0, resulting in sharing same lanelet with this obstacle. However, obstacle 383 maintains a safe lateral distance from the ego vehicle.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Obstacle 383 moves with a similar longitudinal velocity as the ego vehicle and its consistent acceleration suggests no sudden changes in behavior that could lead to collision.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4
- Obstacle ID: 391
- Distance Risk reason:  Obstacle 391 is in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle initially but the ego vehicle changes lanelet later. It maintains a relatively safe longitudinal distance and its trajectory suggests divergence rather than convergence.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Although in the same initial lanelet, the obstacle's slightly higher velocity and consistent acceleration suggest it is moving away from the ego vehicle, reducing the risk of collision.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4


### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. **Most critical obstacles:** Initially, obstacle 391 appeared most critical due to being in the same lanelet and moving at comparable speed to the ego vehicle. Obstacle 383 becomes mildly critical after ego vehicle's lane change.
2. **Trajectory analysis:** Over the 10 timesteps, the ego vehicle changes its lanelet from 41197.0 to 41693.0, thereby sharing same lane with obstacle 383. Obstacle 391 continues on its initial trajectory in lanelet 41197.0. Obstacle 375 remains essentially stationary.
3. **Relative positions, velocities, and accelerations:** The ego vehicle reduces its velocity, while obstacle 391 slightly increases its. The ego vehicle and obstacle 383 shows similar velocities. Obstacle 375 remains nearly stationary.
4. **Collision determination:** No collision has occurred or is imminent based on the observed trajectories and consistent behavior of all obstacles.
5. **Reasoning:** The ego vehicle and obstacle 391's paths are diverging. Obstacle 375 poses no threat due to its distance and immobility. Obstacle 383, though sharing same lanelet with ego vehicle after ego vehicle's lane change, maintains safe distance and shows comparable velocity and acceleration. Hence the scenario is evaluated as a non-collision one.

### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
  "CollisionObstacles": null,
  "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null,
  "ScenarioAnalysis": {
    "IsCollisionScenario": false,
    "Reasoning": "No collisions are detected or predicted.  The ego vehicle changes its lanelet and shares the same lane with obstacle 383, however, they maintain a safe distance with similar speed and acceleration. Obstacle 391, initially in the same lane, diverges from the ego vehicle's path. Obstacle 375 remains stationary and distant. Therefore, the scenario is assessed as safe."
