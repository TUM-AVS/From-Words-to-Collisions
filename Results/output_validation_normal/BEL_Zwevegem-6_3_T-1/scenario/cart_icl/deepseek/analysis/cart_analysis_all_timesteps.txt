### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep (0.9 seconds):

### Obstacle Analysis:

1. **Obstacle ID: 35.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Static obstacle far from ego's trajectory (Y-coordinate difference > 25m). No movement observed.
   - **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: No relative velocity (static obstacle).
   - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)

2. **Obstacle ID: 375.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Static obstacle (minimal movement) in adjacent lanelet (41094.0 vs ego's 41693.0). X-distance > 15m.
   - **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: Near-zero velocity (0.00005 m/s).
   - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)

3. **Obstacle ID: 383.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Moving parallel in same lanelet (41693.0) with ~7m longitudinal distance. Velocity nearly matched to ego.
   - **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: Similar velocity (10.03 vs 7.29 m/s) and stable acceleration trend.
   - **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low Risk)

4. **Obstacle ID: 391.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Moving in same lanelet (41197.0) but diverging trajectory (Y-distance increasing). Current distance ~12m.
   - **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: Higher velocity (8.92 vs 7.29 m/s) but moving away laterally.
   - **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low Risk)

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. No obstacles are on direct collision course (all have distance scores ≥4).
2. Obstacle 383 is closest but maintains parallel movement with matched velocity.
3. All obstacles show stable trajectories over 0.9s with no erratic behavior.
4. Ego's deceleration (-0.0078 m/s²) is negligible, maintaining safe following distance.
