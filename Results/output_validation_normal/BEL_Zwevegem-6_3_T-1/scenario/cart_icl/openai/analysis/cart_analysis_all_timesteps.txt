### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

1. **Obstacle ID: 35.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Positioned far from the ego vehicle and stationary. No signs of movement over time.
   - **Distance safety score**: 5
   - **Time Risk reason**: No velocity or acceleration, consistently stationary.
   - **Time safety score**: 5
   - **Overall Risk score**: 5

2. **Obstacle ID: 310.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Positioned far behind the ego and maintained distance across timestamps.
   - **Distance safety score**: 4
   - **Time Risk reason**: High velocity traveling slightly away from the ego vehicle.
   - **Time safety score**: 5
   - **Overall Risk score**: 4

3. **Obstacle ID: 332.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Positioned far; no movement detected.
   - **Distance safety score**: 5
   - **Time Risk reason**: Completely stationary throughout timeline.
   - **Time safety score**: 5
   - **Overall Risk score**: 5

4. **Obstacle ID: 371.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Positioned well away from the ego in a different lanelet path and gradually distancing.
   - **Distance safety score**: 4
   - **Time Risk reason**: Constant speed and moving away.
   - **Time safety score**: 5
   - **Overall Risk score**: 4

5. **Obstacle ID: 375.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Stationary and far from ego vehicle with no directional conflict.
   - **Distance safety score**: 5
   - **Time Risk reason**: Completely and consistently stationary.
   - **Time safety score**: 5
   - **Overall Risk score**: 5

6. **Obstacle ID: 379.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Positioned parallel to ego path, possible trajectory overlap, but staying steady below potential collision threshold.
   - **Distance safety score**: 3
   - **Time Risk reason**: Continued deceleration, reducing likelihood of collision.
   - **Time safety score**: 4
   - **Overall Risk score**: 3

7. **Obstacle ID: 383.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: In the same lanelet as ego, maintaining close distance due to similar velocities.
   - **Distance safety score**: 3
   - **Time Risk reason**: Close velocity, indicating sustained parallel travel.
   - **Time safety score**: 4
   - **Overall Risk score**: 3

8. **Obstacle ID: 391.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Approaching from behind but slowing down compared to ego vehicle.
   - **Distance safety score**: 4
   - **Time Risk reason**: Consistent approach, but reduced speed reduces immediate collision possibility.
   - **Time safety score**: 4
   - **Overall Risk score**: 4

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
The scenario doesn't denote immediate collision risk for any obstacle. Obstacles 379 and 383 present moderate risk due to their proximity and vectors aligning with the ego's path. However, adjustments in their decelerations and positioning keep this within manageable bounds without an imminent threat of collision.
