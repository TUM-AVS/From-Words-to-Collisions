### Safety analysis for timestep 0.9 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 35**
- Distance Risk reason:  Located at 8.33m longitudinally and 8.33m laterally (front-left) and moving towards the ego vehicle longitudinally.  While the lateral distance seems safe, the continued longitudinal approach warrants attention.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Requires a TTC calculation to ascertain the time to collision, but given the approaching velocity and relatively small distance, there's a moderate time-related risk.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3

- **Obstacle ID: 375**
- Distance Risk reason: Extremely close proximity both longitudinally (0.76m) and laterally (0.76m) in the front-right.  This indicates a very high risk of collision.
- Distance safety score: 1
- Time Risk reason: Given the very short distance and approaching longitudinal velocity, the TTC is likely to be very low, posing an immediate collision risk.
- Time safety score: 1
- Overall Risk score: 1

- **Obstacle ID: 383**
- Distance Risk reason: Located 5.08m longitudinally and 5.08m laterally in the front. While the obstacle is moving away longitudinally, its proximity still represents a low level of risk.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: The obstacle is moving away from the ego vehicle, meaning a collision is unlikely in the near future.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 391**
- Distance Risk reason:  Located 12.35m behind the ego vehicle.  Poses no immediate risk.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Although moving closer to the ego vehicle, the considerable distance and relatively low speed indicate no immediate risk.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4


### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
    "CollisionObstacle": null,
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "375",
        "OverallRiskScore": "1"
    },
    "IsCollisionScenario": false,
    "Justification": "Obstacle 375 poses an extreme risk with a very close proximity and approaching velocity, indicating a high likelihood of a collision if no evasive action is taken. However, at this specific timestep, no actual collision is detected."
}
