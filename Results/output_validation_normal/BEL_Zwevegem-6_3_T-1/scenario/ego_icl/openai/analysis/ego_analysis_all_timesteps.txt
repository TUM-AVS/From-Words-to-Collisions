To analyze the last timestep of the scenario provided, let’s evaluate the conditions for each obstacle:

### Obstacle Analysis

**Obstacle 35** (Front-left)
- **Position**: Longitudinal 8.33 m, Lateral 22.92 m
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal -7.29 m/s (approaching), Lateral 0.00 m/s
- **Trajectory Analysis**: The obstacle is on the front-left, moving towards the ego vehicle. Over the last 5 timesteps, the obstacle’s longitudinal distance decreased gradually, while lateral distance remained stable, suggesting no lateral convergence.
- **Predicted Trajectory**: Continued straight approach from the front-left.
- **TTC Longitudinal**: \( \frac{8.33}{7.29} \approx 1.14 \) seconds
- **MDC**: Since lateral separation is large, MDC > 5.0m (No Risk in terms of collision path on lateral direction).
- **Risk Score**: Medium Risk (3) due to potential longitudinal convergence, but large lateral distance suggests low immediate risk.

**Obstacle 375** (Front-right)
- **Position**: Longitudinal 0.76 m, Lateral -15.73 m
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal -7.29 m/s (approaching), Lateral 0.00 m/s
- **Trajectory Analysis**: Obstacle is coming from front-right, constantly decreasing longitudinal distance, but also moving away laterally.
- **Predicted Trajectory**: Continued straight approach, front-right position.
- **TTC Longitudinal**: \( \frac{0.76}{7.29} \approx 0.10 \) seconds
- **MDC**: Longitudinal MDC \\
- **Risk Score**: Extreme Risk (1) due to very low TTC and close longitudinal distance approaching zero.

**Obstacle 383** (Front)
- **Position**: Longitudinal 5.08 m, Lateral 0.00 m
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal 2.75 m/s (moving away), Lateral -0.02 m/s
- **Trajectory Analysis**: Exact lateral alignment, initially moving toward, but currently moving away in both dimensions slightly.
- **Predicted Trajectory**: Moving away from ego vehicle.
- **TTC Longitudinal**: Not applicable, moving away
- **MDC**: Current position suggests it is moving away, so MDC > 5m.
- **Risk Score**: No risk (5) as trajectories are diverging.

**Obstacle 391** (Behind)
- **Position**: Longitudinal -12.35 m, Lateral 0.00 m
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal 1.63 m/s (approaching), Lateral 0.31 m/s
- **Trajectory Analysis**: Approaching from behind steadily, but distance is quite large.
- **Predicted Trajectory**: Continues to close in longitude from behind, but unlikely immediate threat.
- **TTC Longitudinal**: \( \frac{12.35}{1.63} \approx 7.58 \) seconds
- **MDC**: Same lane, approaching slowly from behind, thus MDC large.
- **Risk Score**: Low Risk (4), but possibly higher in extended future if trends continue downwards aggressively.

### Conclusion

From the analysis, obstacle 375 presents an Extreme Risk due to an imminently closing distance and converging trajectory with very low TTC. The other obstacles are either moving away, maintaining significant lateral distance, or have high TTC values and pose no immediate threat.

### Collision Scenario Determination
The presence of Obstacle 375, which has an Extreme Risk (risk score of 1), signifies that this is indeed a collision scenario according to our criteria.
