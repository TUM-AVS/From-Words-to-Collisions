Obstacle 312 is located in a different lanelet (42242) than the ego vehicle, which transitions into lanelet 42875.  While 312's velocity is increasing, its lateral position suggests it poses no immediate threat.

Obstacle 319 is in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle (both in 42875 after ego's transition).  Obstacle 319's x-position is consistently greater than the ego's, meaning it's ahead of the ego vehicle. While 319 is accelerating and the ego is decelerating slightly, their relative positions and the distance between them doesn't suggest an imminent collision.  However, their shared lanelet warrants continued monitoring. Because the ego vehicle is decelerating and obstacle 319 is accelerating, their relative speed is quite large, which could pose a risk in the near future. Therefore, this is categorized as a High Risk.
