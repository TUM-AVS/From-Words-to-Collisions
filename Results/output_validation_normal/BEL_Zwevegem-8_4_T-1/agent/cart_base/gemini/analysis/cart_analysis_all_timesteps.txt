Obstacle 312 is in a different lanelet than the ego vehicle for the entire duration and maintains a significant lateral separation.  Therefore, it poses no collision risk.

Obstacle 319 and the ego vehicle are initially in different lanelets. However, at time 0.4, the ego vehicle changes to lanelet 42875, the same lanelet as obstacle 319. While sharing the same lanelet, the longitudinal distance between the ego vehicle and obstacle 319 decreases, and obstacle 319's velocity is increasing while the ego vehicle decelerates slightly.  This suggests a potential high risk of collision.  Since there's no indication of an imminent collision in the next time step, it's not categorized as extreme risk (1) yet.
