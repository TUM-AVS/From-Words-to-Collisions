At t=0.9s, the ego vehicle is at (42.4054, 159.2338) in lanelet 42875.

Obstacle 312 is at (25.740723, 176.63576) in lanelet 42242.  This obstacle is significantly far from the ego vehicle and poses no immediate threat.

Obstacle 319 is at (46.047795, 153.80981) and also in lanelet 42875. This obstacle shares the same lanelet as the ego vehicle and requires closer examination.

**Analysis at t=0.9s**

* **Ego and Obstacle 319:**  Obstacle 319 is behind the ego vehicle in the same lane. While the Y-coordinate difference suggests a safe distance currently, Obstacle 319's increasing velocity (and higher acceleration than the ego vehicle) suggests it is approaching the ego vehicle rapidly. Further analysis of their trajectories through time is needed to precisely determine the risk.

* **Trajectory Analysis:**  Observing positions from t=0.1s to t=0.9s, both Ego and Obstacle 319 are generally moving in the negative Y direction. Obstacle 319 is consistently gaining on the ego vehicle in the Y direction. In the X direction, Obstacle 319 also started further away from the ego vehicle and moved closer.

* **TTC Estimation:** Although precise TTC calculation requires more information (like vehicle dimensions and precise velocity vectors), a simplified analysis of the Y-coordinate differences between Ego and Obstacle 319 over time reveals a decreasing trend. This strongly suggests a potential for a rear-end collision if the current trends continue.

* **MDC Estimation:**  At t=0.9s, the distance between Ego and Obstacle 319 is approximately sqrt((46.047795 - 42.4054)^2 + (153.80981 - 159.2338)^2) ≈ 6.0 units. This distance is relatively small, and given Obstacle 319’s approach speed, it poses a risk if the Ego vehicle brakes suddenly or if Obstacle 319 continues to increase its speed.


**Risk Assessment**

* **Obstacle 312:** Negligible Risk (Score 5). Far from the ego vehicle and in a different lane.
* **Obstacle 319:** High Risk (Score 2). Sharing the same lane and rapidly approaching the ego vehicle from behind. Given the current trajectories, a rear-end collision is likely in future timestamps if actions are not taken by the ego vehicle.
