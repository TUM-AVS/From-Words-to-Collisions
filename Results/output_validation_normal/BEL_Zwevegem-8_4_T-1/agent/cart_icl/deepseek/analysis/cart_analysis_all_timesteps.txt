### Analysis:

1. **Obstacle 312**: 
   - Positioned at (25.740723, 176.63576) at 0.9s, moving at 3.3100763 m/s with acceleration 0.8780985 m/s².
   - Relative to Ego (42.4054, 159.2338), the distance is significant (~17m longitudinally and ~17m laterally).
   - TTC is not immediately calculable due to large lateral separation.
   - **Risk Score**: 5 (Negligible Risk) - No significant risk of collision.

2. **Obstacle 319**: 
   - Positioned at (46.047795, 153.80981) at 0.9s, moving at 2.374817 m/s with acceleration 2.2227495 m/s².
   - Relative to Ego (42.4054, 159.2338), the distance is ~3.6m longitudinally and ~5.4m laterally.
   - TTC is not immediately calculable due to lateral separation, but the obstacle is accelerating and moving towards the ego's lane.
   - **Risk Score**: 3 (Medium Risk) - Manageable with proper reaction.
