At t=0.9s, Ego is in lanelet 42875 with obstacle 319. Obstacle 312 is in a different lanelet (42242).

**Obstacle 312 (ID: 312):**  This obstacle is in a different lanelet and poses no immediate threat.  The lateral distance is significant, and the longitudinal motion doesn't indicate a likely intersection with the ego vehicle's path in the near future. Risk: **Negligible (5)**

**Obstacle 319 (ID: 319):** This obstacle is in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle. Analyzing the provided data from 0.0s to 0.9s, both the ego vehicle and the obstacle are moving in roughly the same direction (indicated by similar, negative orientations). However, Obstacle 319's x-coordinate is increasing at a faster rate than the ego vehicle's, suggesting it may be overtaking the ego vehicle or potentially represents some lane change maneuver by the ego vehicle. Additionally, the obstacle's velocity is increasing while the ego vehicle's velocity is slightly decreasing. It is situated slightly behind the ego vehicle with a decreasing x-coordinate difference. A precise risk assessment requires more information about the lanelet geometry and the vehicles' widths to determine the lateral separation during the potential overtake. Without more information, estimating a precise TTC is difficult, but based on the changing x-coordinates, velocities and the same lanelet occupancy, this warrants a closer look. Risk: **Medium (3)** based on current data.
