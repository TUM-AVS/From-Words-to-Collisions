### Analysis of Scenario at 0.9 seconds:

#### Ego Vehicle:
- **Position**: (42.4054, 159.2338)
- **Velocity**: 2.3471 m/s
- **Lanelet**: 42875.0

#### Obstacle 312:
- **Position**: (25.740723, 176.63576)
- **Velocity**: 3.3100763 m/s
- **Lanelet**: 42242.0
- **Assessment**: This obstacle is in a different lanelet, moving away from the ego. The lateral distance is significant, indicating **negligible risk**.

#### Obstacle 319:
- **Position**: (46.047795, 153.80981)
- **Velocity**: 2.374817 m/s
- **Lanelet**: 42875.0
- **Assessment**:
  - **Relative Position**: The obstacle is ahead of the ego vehicle.
  - **Relative Velocity**: Moving at a slightly higher velocity and accelerating more than the ego vehicle.
  - **Distance Calculation**: √((46.047795 - 42.4054)² + (153.80981 - 159.2338)²) ≈ 6.18m
  - **TTC Calculation**: Given both are in the same lanelet and approaching each other, TTC is irrelevant as distances are sufficiently large and velocities are low.
  - **Lateral Distance**: Critical to realize this as a same-lane scenario implies TTC should be considered from direct trajectory perspective.  
  - **Risk**: Although there is a closing distance ahead and both are in the same lanelet, the low approach speed and current safe distance indicates **medium risk** with necessary reaction time.

### Risk Evaluation:
- Obstacle 312 is in a different lane and moving away.
- Obstacle 319, while in the same lanelet and higher speed, is unlikely to result in immediate collision due to its trajectory and manageable conditions.
