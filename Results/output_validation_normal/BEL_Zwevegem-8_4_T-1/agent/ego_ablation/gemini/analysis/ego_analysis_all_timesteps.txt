At the most recent timestep (0.9 seconds), Obstacle 319 is only 1.97 meters in front of the ego vehicle and closing at a relative longitudinal velocity of -0.07 m/s. While the closing velocity is small, the proximity is concerning.  The lateral relative velocity is larger, but still doesn't appear to pose an immediate collision risk given the aligned positioning. The relative acceleration suggests the obstacle might be braking.  While a collision is not imminent, the close proximity and dynamic situation warrant a high-risk assessment. Obstacle 312, while approaching from behind, is almost 20 meters away and poses no immediate threat.
