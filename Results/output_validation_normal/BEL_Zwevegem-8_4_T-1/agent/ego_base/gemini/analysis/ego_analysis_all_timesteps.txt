At t=0.9s:
* **Obstacle 312:**  Located behind the ego vehicle at -19.57m longitudinal and 0.0m lateral distance. It is approaching the ego vehicle with a relative longitudinal velocity of 0.96 m/s. This poses a low risk currently.

* **Obstacle 319:** Located in front of the ego vehicle at 1.97m longitudinal and 0.0m lateral distance.  The relative longitudinal velocity is -0.07 m/s, meaning the closing speed is very low. However, the lateral velocity is -0.66 m/s, suggesting a potential lateral movement concerning the ego vehicle. While the longitudinal distance is small, the near-zero relative longitudinal velocity puts this obstacle in a medium-risk category as there's still time to react.
