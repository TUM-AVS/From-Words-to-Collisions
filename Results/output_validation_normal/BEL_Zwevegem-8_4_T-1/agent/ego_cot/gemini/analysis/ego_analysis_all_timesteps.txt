### Safety analysis for timestep 0.9s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

**- Obstacle ID: 312**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 312 is far behind the ego vehicle (-19.57m longitudinal and -19.57m lateral) and poses no immediate threat.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason:  The obstacle is moving towards the ego vehicle, but given the large distance and low relative velocity, a collision is unlikely in the near future.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

**- Obstacle ID: 319**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 319 is very close to the ego vehicle in the front (1.97m longitudinal and 1.97m lateral), presenting a high risk of collision.
- Distance safety score: 2
- Time Risk reason: The low longitudinal relative velocity (-0.07 m/s) and the close proximity suggest a high risk of collision if the ego vehicle does not react quickly. While the lateral movement might avoid a direct head-on collision, it still poses a significant risk.
- Time safety score: 2
- Overall Risk score: 2
