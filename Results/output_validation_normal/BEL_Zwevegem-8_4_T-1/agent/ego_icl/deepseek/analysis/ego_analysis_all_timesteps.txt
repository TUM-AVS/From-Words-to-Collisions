### Obstacle Analysis

#### Obstacle 312 (Behind the ego car)
- **Latest Timestep (0.9s):**
  - **Adjusted Distance:** Longitudinal -19.57 m, Lateral 0.00 m
  - **Relative Velocity:** Longitudinal 0.96 m/s, Lateral 0.14 m/s
  - **Motion:** Driving toward the ego car from behind with exact lateral alignment.
  
- **Trajectory Analysis:**
  - The longitudinal distance is decreasing (from -20.08 m to -19.57 m over 0.9s), indicating the obstacle is approaching the ego car from behind.
  - The lateral distance remains 0.00 m, meaning the obstacle is aligned in the same lane.
  - The relative longitudinal velocity is positive (0.96 m/s), confirming the obstacle is closing the gap.
  - The lateral velocity is very small (0.14 m/s) and not significant for collision risk.

- **TTC Calculation:**
  - Longitudinal TTC = Distance / Relative Velocity = 19.57 / 0.96 ≈ 20.39 seconds (No Risk, TTC > 5.0s)
  - Lateral TTC is not applicable since the lateral distance is stable (0.00 m) and the lateral velocity is negligible.

- **MDC Calculation:**
  - Since the obstacle is behind and aligned laterally, the primary risk is longitudinal.
  - MDC = 19.57 m (No Risk, MDC > 5.0m)

- **Overall Risk:** 5 (Negligible Risk)

#### Obstacle 319 (Front of the ego car)
- **Latest Timestep (0.9s):**
  - **Adjusted Distance:** Longitudinal 1.97 m, Lateral 0.00 m
  - **Relative Velocity:** Longitudinal -0.07 m/s, Lateral -0.66 m/s
  - **Motion:** Driving toward the ego car longitudinally with exact lateral alignment.

- **Trajectory Analysis:**
  - The longitudinal distance is decreasing (from 2.57 m to 1.97 m over 0.9s), but the rate of decrease is slowing (relative velocity is -0.07 m/s, almost zero).
  - The lateral distance remains 0.00 m, meaning the obstacle is aligned in the same lane.
  - The relative longitudinal velocity is very small (-0.07 m/s), indicating the obstacle is almost stationary relative to the ego car.
  - The lateral velocity is -0.66 m/s, but since the lateral distance is 0.00 m, this could indicate a potential lateral collision risk if not corrected.

- **TTC Calculation:**
  - Longitudinal TTC = Distance / Relative Velocity = 1.97 / 0.07 ≈ 28.14 seconds (No Risk, TTC > 5.0s)
  - Lateral TTC = Distance / Relative Velocity = 0.00 / 0.66 = 0.00 seconds (Collision Risk, TTC = 0s)

- **MDC Calculation:**
  - Since the obstacle is front and aligned laterally, the primary risk is lateral.
  - MDC = 0.00 m (Collision Risk, MDC = 0m)

- **Overall Risk:** 0 (Collision Risk)

### Explanation:
- **Obstacle 319** is at a collision risk (score 0) because the lateral distance is 0.00 m and the lateral velocity is non-zero, indicating a potential lateral collision.
- **Obstacle 312** poses negligible risk (score 5) as it is far behind and closing the gap very slowly. The lateral alignment does not contribute to risk since the lateral velocity is minimal.
