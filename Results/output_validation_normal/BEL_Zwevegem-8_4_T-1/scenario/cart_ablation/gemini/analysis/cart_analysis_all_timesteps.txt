At t=0.9s, Ego is in lanelet 42875.

Obstacle 312 is in lanelet 42242 and poses no immediate risk.

Obstacle 319 is also in lanelet 42875.  The positions of Ego (42.4054, 159.2338) and Obstacle 319 (46.047795, 153.80981) show a concerning proximity.  Furthermore, Obstacle 319's velocity is increasing rapidly (accelerations around 2 m/s^2 in recent timesteps), while Ego's velocity is slightly decreasing. This closing velocity combined with the proximity raises a serious concern, suggesting an extreme risk of collision in the next few timesteps.
