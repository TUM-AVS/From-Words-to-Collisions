At t=0.9s, Ego is in lanelet 42875.

Obstacle 312 is in lanelet 42242 and is far from Ego, posing no immediate risk.

Obstacle 319 is also in lanelet 42875 and its position (46.047795, 153.80981) is relatively close to Ego's (42.4054, 159.2338).  While the y-coordinate difference suggests some separation, the x-coordinate difference is small and shrinking over the previous timesteps. Obstacle 319's velocity is increasing significantly over time, further increasing the risk of collision in the near future. Given the closing distance and the acceleration patterns, this situation represents an extreme risk.
