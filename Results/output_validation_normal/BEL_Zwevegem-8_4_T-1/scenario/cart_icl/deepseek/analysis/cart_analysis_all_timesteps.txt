### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep:

### Obstacle Analysis:
#### Obstacle ID: 312.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is in the same lanelet (42242.0) as the ego vehicle but is moving away (increasing distance over time). The current distance (~24.74m) is large enough to avoid immediate collision.
- **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
- **Time Risk reason**: The obstacle is accelerating (velocity increasing from 2.71 to 3.31 m/s) but moving in the opposite direction relative to the ego vehicle. The relative velocity is high enough to avoid collision.
- **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
- **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low Risk)

#### Obstacle ID: 319.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is in the same lanelet (42875.0) as the ego vehicle and is approaching (distance decreasing over time). The current distance (~5.64m) is concerning but not critical yet.
- **Distance safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk)
- **Time Risk reason**: The obstacle is accelerating (velocity increasing from 0.87 to 2.37 m/s) and moving towards the ego vehicle. The relative velocity is moderate, but the trend is worrisome.
- **Time safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk)
- **Overall Risk score**: 3 (Medium Risk)

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. **Obstacle 312.0**: Moving away from the ego vehicle with increasing velocity. No immediate threat.
2. **Obstacle 319.0**: Approaching the ego vehicle with increasing velocity. The distance is decreasing but not yet critical.
3. **Conclusion**: No collision or extreme risk at the current timestep, but Obstacle 319.0 requires monitoring due to its trajectory and acceleration.
