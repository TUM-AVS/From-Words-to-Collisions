### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 30
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 30 is in a different lanelet and moving away from the ego vehicle.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason:  The relative velocity and trajectories indicate no imminent risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 37
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 37 is in a different lanelet and far from the ego vehicle.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Low velocity and no trajectory conflicts.

- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 310
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 310 is in a different lanelet and far from the ego vehicle.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Low velocity and no trajectory conflicts.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 312
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 312 is behind the ego vehicle in the same lanelet, but moving slower and poses no immediate risk.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason:  Though in the same lane, the difference in Y position is increasing, reducing risk over time.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- Obstacle ID: 319
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 319 is in a different lanelet, but poses a potential risk due to proximity and the ego vehicle's lane change.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: The relative velocity and direction suggest a potential conflict in the near future.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3

- Obstacle ID: 320
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 320 is in a different lanelet and poses no immediate risk.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Low velocity and different lane.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 322
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 322 is in a different lanelet and far from the ego vehicle.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: No trajectory conflicts.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 323
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 323 is in a different lanelet and far from the ego vehicle.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: No trajectory conflicts.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 333
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 333 is in a different lanelet and far from the ego vehicle.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason:  No trajectory conflicts.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 337
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 337 is behind the ego vehicle in the same lanelet, but moving slower.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Although in the same lanelet, the large distance and different velocities suggest no immediate risk.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
This is not a collision scenario. No obstacle has a risk score of 0, indicating no immediate collision. While some obstacles are in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle, their trajectories and velocities suggest no imminent collision. The ego vehicle's lane change introduces some risk with Obstacle 319, but it's not an immediate collision risk.

### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
  "CollisionObstacles": null,
  "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null,
  "ScenarioAnalysis": {
    "IsCollisionScenario": false,
    "Reasoning": "No obstacle has a risk score of 0.  Obstacle 319 presents a medium risk due to the ego vehicle's lane change, but no immediate collision is predicted."
  }
}
