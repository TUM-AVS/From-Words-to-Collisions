Obstacle 319 is in front of the ego vehicle and very close (1.97m).  While the relative longitudinal velocity suggests the obstacle is slowing down relative to the ego (-0.07 m/s), the small distance represents an extreme risk.  The lateral relative velocity (-0.66 m/s) and acceleration (-2.02 m/sÂ²) indicate a potential lateral movement of the obstacle relative to the ego, but the primary concern is the close longitudinal proximity. Obstacle 312 is far behind (-19.57m) and moving relatively slowly, hence it represents very little immediate threat.

    "Reasoning": "Obstacle 319 poses an extreme risk due to its very close proximity in front of the ego vehicle (1.97m), despite the slowing relative longitudinal velocity. While not an immediate collision, the situation necessitates immediate action to avoid impact.  Obstacle 312 is not a significant risk at this time."
