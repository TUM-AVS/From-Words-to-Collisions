At t=0.9s, Obstacle 319 is in front of the ego vehicle at a longitudinal distance of 1.97m.  The relative longitudinal velocity is -0.07 m/s indicating a very slow closing velocity, almost stationary relative to the ego vehicle. However, the lateral velocity is -0.66 m/s and increasing, which suggests a potential lateral movement across the ego vehicle's path. Although the longitudinal distance is small, the slow relative longitudinal speed makes a collision in the next timestep unlikely. Obstacle 312 is behind the ego vehicle and poses no immediate threat.

        "Reasoning": "Obstacle 319 is very close to the ego vehicle longitudinally (1.97m) and moving laterally across its path.  Although not a guaranteed collision in the next timestep due to the very small longitudinal closing velocity, the situation presents an extreme risk."
