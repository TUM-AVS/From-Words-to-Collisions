### Safety analysis for timestep 0.9 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 312**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 312 is behind the ego vehicle at a longitudinal distance of -19.57m and a lateral distance of -19.57m.  It poses no immediate risk due to its position behind the ego vehicle.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: While the obstacle is approaching longitudinally (positive relative velocity), the large distance and relatively slow speed suggest ample time to react. 
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 319**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 319 is in front of the ego vehicle at a longitudinal distance of 1.97m and a lateral distance of 1.97m.  This close proximity indicates a high risk. The lateral distance also suggests a potential lateral component to the risk.
- Distance safety score: 2
- Time Risk reason:  The longitudinal relative velocity is -0.07 m/s, near zero, meaning the longitudinal closing speed is very small.  However, the lateral relative velocity is -0.66 m/s, indicating a lateral closing motion. This close distance combined with lateral movement significantly increases the risk. Although the longitudinal relative acceleration is positive (0.96 m/s²), suggesting the ego vehicle might be accelerating,  it's unclear if this is sufficient to avoid a collision given the small distance and lateral motion. The lateral acceleration (-2.02 m/s²) makes it more complex to predict the precise trajectory.
- Time safety score: 2
- Overall Risk score: 2


### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
    "CollisionObstacle": null,
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "319",
        "OverallRiskScore": "2"
    },
    "IsCollisionScenario": false,
    "Justification": "Obstacle 319 presents a high risk due to its close proximity (1.97m longitudinal and 1.97m lateral) and the lateral relative velocity, posing an immediate danger.  No collision is predicted within the assessed time frame, but the situation warrants close monitoring and evasive action may be needed soon."
