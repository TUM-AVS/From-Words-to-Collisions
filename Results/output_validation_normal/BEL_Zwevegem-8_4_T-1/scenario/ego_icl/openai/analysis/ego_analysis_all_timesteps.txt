### Obstacle-by-Obstacle Analysis

**Obstacle 312** (Behind):
- **Position Change & Alignment**: 
  - Longitudinal distance decreased from -20.08m to -19.57m.
  - Lateral distance remains 0.00m, indicating exact alignment behind the ego car.
- **Relative Motion**: 
  - Longitudinal velocity increased from 0.35 m/s to 0.96 m/s towards ego.
  - Longitudinal acceleration shows the obstacle is speeding up.
- **Trajectory Analysis**: 
  - Although coming from behind, its speed relative to the ego vehicle is low, and the distance change per second is minor.
- **TTC Calculation**: 
  - Currently, TTC is high as the distance is quite large (19.57m), and the closing velocity is small.
- **MDC**: 
  - Given the increase in speed and alignment, but distance yet large (19.57m), MDC is approximately the same as current longitudinal distance.
- **Risk Assessment**:
  - TTC > 5.0s; MDC ≈ 19.57m
  - **Risk Score**: 5 (No Risk), as no immediate collision threat is posed right now.

**Obstacle 319** (Front):
- **Position Change & Alignment**: 
  - Longitudinal distance decreased from 2.57m to 1.97m.
  - Lateral distance remains 0.00m, indicating exact alignment in front of the ego car.
- **Relative Motion**: 
  - Longitudinal velocity substantially negative but decelerating.
  - It’s moving towards ego with reduced relative velocity over time.
- **Trajectory Analysis**:
  - The vehicle is decelerating, reducing its relative speed to the ego vehicle.
- **TTC Calculation**:
  - TTC_longitudinal = 1.97m / 0.07m/s = ~28.14s (approach velocity reducing to zero)
- **MDC**: 
  - Predict upcoming stop in relative velocity and relative adjustment.
  - Reduced distance suggests MDC also reducing, approximate close to current distance when stopping.
- **Risk Assessment**:
  - Large adjusted longitudinal distance and decreasing impact velocity. The collision is not imminent with current trends unless sudden acceleration takes place.
  - **Risk Score**: 5 (No Risk), more aligned and reducing speed without collision immediately.

### Conclusion
Currently, there is no immediate collision scenario with either obstacle, given their relatively larger distances and low or reducing velocities.
