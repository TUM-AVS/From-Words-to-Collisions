Here's the analysis and the JSON output:

**Analysis:**

* **Obstacle 3058:** This obstacle is in the same lanelet (151) as the ego vehicle and initially behind it.  However, it's moving faster than the ego vehicle and closing the distance rapidly. While not a collision in the observed timeframe, it represents the highest risk and could lead to a rear-end collision very soon if the behavior continues. This is potentially an *Extreme Risk (1)* or *High Risk (2)* depending on safety margins and deceleration capabilities not evident in the provided data.  Further prediction of trajectories is essential.

* **Obstacle 3053:** This obstacle is in a neighboring lanelet (154) and its y-position (longitudinal in this case) is increasing faster than the ego vehicle.  This implies the vehicles are moving roughly in parallel.  A lane change by either vehicle would pose an extreme risk.  Without lane change information, the risk is currently *Medium (3)* or *Low (4)* depending on the lateral distance between lanelets and vehicle widths.

* **Obstacles 3052 & 3054:** These are stationary or slow-moving obstacles in a different lanelet (127). They do not pose an immediate threat based on the provided information.  They are *Low Risk (4)* or *Negligible Risk (5)*.

* **Obstacle 3055:** This obstacle is in a different lanelet (153) and has come to a stop. It's relatively close to the ego vehicle laterally, but its stationary nature reduces the risk significantly. This is likely a *Low Risk (4)* or *Negligible Risk (5)*.
