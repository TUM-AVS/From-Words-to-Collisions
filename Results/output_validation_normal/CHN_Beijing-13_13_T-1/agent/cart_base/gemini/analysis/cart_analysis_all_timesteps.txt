Here's an analysis of the scenario and the resulting JSON:

**Analysis:**

* **Obstacle 3058:** This obstacle is in the same lanelet (151) as the ego vehicle and initially behind it.  However, it's moving faster than the ego vehicle and closing the distance rapidly. While not colliding in the provided timeframe, the consistent closing velocity and similar headings suggest a high risk of collision in the near future.

* **Obstacle 3053:** This obstacle is in a different lanelet (154) but its position is close to the ego vehicle, especially at later timesteps. The ego vehicle changes lanelets between timesteps 0.4 and 0.5, but it transitions to lanelet 453 (not in the provided data, assumed different from 154 or 151).  Without lanelet map information, it is difficult to determine if there is a risk associated with obstacle 3053. More information on the lanelets geometry, and if the ego vehicle changes lanelets towards 154, is needed to assess the risk.


* **Obstacles 3052, 3054, and 3055:** These obstacles are stationary or moving slowly and are positioned laterally away from the ego vehicle's trajectory in different lanelets. They do not present an immediate collision risk within the given timeframe.


**JSON Output:**
