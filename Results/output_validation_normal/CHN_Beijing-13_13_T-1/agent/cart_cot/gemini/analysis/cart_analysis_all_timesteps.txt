**Analysis and Risk Assessment:**

Focusing on the most recent timestep (t=0.9s), we can observe the following:

* **Obstacle 3052 and 3054:** These obstacles are stationary or slow-moving and located in lanelet 127. Given the Ego vehicle's current trajectory in lanelet 453, there is no immediate risk of collision with these obstacles.  Risk Score: 5 (Negligible Risk).
* **Obstacle 3053:** Located in lanelet 154 and is ahead of the ego vehicle. It is moving with a speed slightly lower than the ego vehicle and decelerating more quickly. Risk score: 4 (Low Risk)
* **Obstacle 3055:** Stationary and positioned laterally relative to the ego vehicle in lanelet 153. Based on the provided data, there is no immediate collision risk. However, more context on the lanelets and ego vehicle's intended path is needed for a definitive assessment. Risk Score: 4 (Low Risk)
* **Obstacle 3058:**  This obstacle is in the same lanelet (151) as the ego vehicle was previously and is behind the ego vehicle. The obstacle is approaching faster than the ego is moving away, but ego has moved into a different lanelet. Risk Score: 4 (Low Risk)
