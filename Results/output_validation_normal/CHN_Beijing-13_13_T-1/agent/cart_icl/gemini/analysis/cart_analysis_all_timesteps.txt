At t=0.9s, the ego vehicle (ID 3056) is in lanelet 453 with a decreasing velocity, indicating braking. Let's analyze the risk posed by each obstacle:

* **Obstacle 3052:** Stationary and far laterally in lanelet 127. Negligible risk.
* **Obstacle 3053:**  Located in lanelet 154, moving with a decreasing velocity.  Given the lateral separation and the different lanelets, the risk is low.
* **Obstacle 3054:** Stationary and far laterally in lanelet 127. Negligible risk.
* **Obstacle 3055:** Stationary and laterally separated in lanelet 153.  Negligible risk.
* **Obstacle 3058:** In the same lanelet 151 as the ego vehicle was initially and moving with a decreasing velocity. However, the ego vehicle has transitioned to lanelet 453.  Although the y-coordinates suggest 3058 is behind the ego vehicle, the lane change of the ego vehicle makes a collision unlikely. Therefore, the risk is low.
