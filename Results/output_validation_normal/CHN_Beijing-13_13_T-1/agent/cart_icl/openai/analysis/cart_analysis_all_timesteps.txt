Let's analyze the scenario at the most recent timestep, 0.9 seconds, focusing on the relative positions, velocities, and potential collision risks for each obstacle relative to the ego vehicle:

### Analysis at 0.9 seconds:

#### Ego Vehicle (3056.0):
- **Position**: (441.769, 575.9844)
- **Velocity**: 11.1437 m/s
- **Acceleration**: -3.2626 m/s²
- **Lanelet**: 453.0

### Obstacles:

#### Obstacle 3052.0:
- **Position**: (450.9588, 581.5957)
- **Velocity**: 0.0 m/s (stationary)
- **Lanelet**: 127.0
- **Distance to Ego**: Approximately 10.6 meters away laterally.
- **Assessment**: No immediate risk given the lateral separation and stationary status.

#### Obstacle 3053.0:
- **Position**: (440.8476, 601.1415)
- **Velocity**: 10.8032 m/s
- **Acceleration**: -5.7304 m/s²
- **Lanelet**: 154.0
- **Distance to Ego**: Approximately 25.16 meters ahead, slightly to the left.
- **Slope towards closure**: Acceleration indicates slowing down, reducing risk over time.
- **Assessment**: No immediate risk, and the obstacle is slowing down, increasing separation.

#### Obstacle 3054.0:
- **Position**: (458.8677, 581.9176)
- **Velocity**: 0.4242 m/s
- **Lanelet**: 127.0
- **Distance to Ego**: Approximately 17.1 meters away laterally.
- **Assessment**: Given the low speed and lateral separation, there’s no significant risk of collision.

#### Obstacle 3055.0:
- **Position**: (437.7787, 589.939)
- **Velocity**: 0.0 m/s (stationary)
- **Lanelet**: 153.0
- **Distance to Ego**: Approximately 14 meters laterally.
- **Assessment**: Completely stationary, not in a trajectory risk with the ego vehicle.

#### Obstacle 3058.0:
- **Position**: (442.4432, 554.1083)
- **Velocity**: 11.7672 m/s
- **Acceleration**: -4.7725 m/s²
- **Lanelet**: 151.0
- **TTC to ego**: Ego is ahead and the obstacle is decelerating.
- **Assessment**: Currently, no collision risk due to relative positions and velocities. Slight deceleration from the obstacle increases safety.

### Overall Assessment:
None of the obstacles present an immediate risk of collision based on the analyzed trajectories, velocities, and relative positions.

```json
{
    "CollisionObstacles": [],
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {},
    "HighRiskObstacle": {}
}
```

No obstacles have been determined to pose a risk significant enough to warrant a score of 0, 1, or 2 in this scenario. All obstacles are either decelerating or at a non-threatening relative position.
