At t=0.9s, Obstacle 3052 is only 0.79m in front of the ego vehicle and slightly to the right.  Its high closing velocity (-11.14 m/s) indicates a very high probability of imminent collision. Obstacle 3054 also poses a significant risk, being only 0.84m ahead and further to the right, also with a high closing velocity (-11.15 m/s). While other obstacles are moving towards the ego vehicle, their distances and relative velocities suggest they are not immediate threats compared to 3052 and 3054. Due to the short distance and high closing velocity, both 3052 and 3054 present extreme risks. However, 3052 is closer longitudinally, making it the most critical obstacle.
