Obstacle 3052:
- Trajectory: This obstacle has been consistently approaching the ego vehicle from the front-right.  The longitudinal distance has decreased from 11.46m to 0.79m over the 0.9 seconds, while the lateral distance has remained relatively constant around -7.77m.
- TTC (Longitudinal): 0.79m / 11.14m/s = 0.07s
- TTC (Lateral): Not applicable as lateral velocity is zero.
- MDC: Approximately 0.79m (primarily longitudinal as lateral distance is larger and constant)
- Risk Assessment: Extremely high risk (1) due to very low TTC and MDC.  Collision is imminent if trajectories are maintained.

Obstacle 3053:
- Trajectory: This obstacle is in front of the ego vehicle and appears to be slowing down or nearly stopped relative to the ego vehicle.  The longitudinal distance has decreased slightly from 21.29m to 20.67m. Lateral distance remains at 0.00 indicating longitudinal alignment.
- TTC (Longitudinal): 20.67m / 0.34m/s = 60.79s
- TTC (Lateral): Not applicable due to zero lateral velocity.
- MDC: Approximately 20.67m (longitudinal distance)
- Risk Assessment: Negligible risk (5) due to large longitudinal distance and very slow closing velocity. Despite lateral alignment, the lack of lateral movement and minimal longitudinal closing velocity indicate no immediate risk.

Obstacle 3054:
- Trajectory: Approaching the ego vehicle from the front-right, similar to Obstacle 3052. The longitudinal distance has decreased significantly from 11.55m to 0.84m, while the lateral distance decreased from -16.13m to -15.68m.
- TTC (Longitudinal): 0.84m / 11.15m/s = 0.075s
- TTC (Lateral): 15.68m / 0.42 m/s = 37.33s
- MDC: Approximately 0.84m (primarily longitudinal as lateral distance is larger)
- Risk Assessment: Extremely high risk (1) due to a very low longitudinal TTC and MDC. Collision is imminent if trajectories are maintained.

Obstacle 3055:
- Trajectory: This obstacle is approaching from the front-left. The longitudinal distance has decreased from 20.23m to 9.57m.  The lateral distance remains almost constant at around 1.90m.
- TTC (Longitudinal): 9.57m / 11.14m/s = 0.86s
- TTC (Lateral): Not applicable, no lateral relative movement.
- MDC: Approximately 1.90m (using the lateral distance as a conservative estimate due to the near constant value).
- Risk Assessment: High Risk (2) due to low TTC and MDC.  Requires prompt action.


Obstacle 3058:
- Trajectory: This obstacle is behind the ego vehicle and the longitudinal distance has slightly decreased from -17.45m to -17.38m. Lateral distance remains at 0.00m (same lane).  The obstacle is slowly approaching from behind.
- TTC (Longitudinal): 17.38m / 0.62m/s = 28.03s
- TTC (Lateral): Not applicable as there's lateral alignment and minimal/no lateral movement.
- MDC: 17.38m
- Risk Assessment: Negligible risk (5) due to significant distance and low closing velocity.
