### Obstacle-by-Obstacle Analysis

#### **Obstacle 3052**
- **Position:** Front-right
- **Adjusted Distance:** Longitudinal 0.79 m, Lateral -7.77 m
- **Relative Velocity:** Longitudinal -11.14 m/s, Lateral 0.00 m/s
- **Motion Description:** Moving toward the ego car longitudinally, no lateral motion.

**Trajectory Analysis:**
- The longitudinal distance decreased from earlier timesteps, indicating a closing trajectory.
- The obstacle is on a collision course given the very close longitudinal distance and significant closing velocity.

**Risk Assessment:**
  - **TTC Calculation:** Approximate TTC = 0.79 m / 11.14 m/s ≈ 0.071 s
  - **MDC Calculation:** MDC is effectively the longitudinal distance as lateral motion is zero in this dimension: 0.79 m

**Conclusion:** Immediate collision possible due to extreme proximity and rapid closing velocity.

#### **Obstacle 3053**
- **Position:** Front
- **Adjusted Distance:** Longitudinal 20.67 m, Lateral 0.00 m
- **Relative Velocity:** Longitudinal -0.34 m/s, Lateral 0.05 m/s
- **Motion Description:** Moving towards ego longitudinally with exact lateral alignment.

**Trajectory Analysis:**
- The longitudinal distance remains significantly greater than the danger threshold.
- Slow closing velocity reduces immediate risk.

**Risk Assessment:**
  - **TTC Calculation:** TTC = 20.67 m / 0.34 m/s ≈ 60.8 s (negligible risk timeframe)
  - **MDC Calculation:** Greater than danger thresholds in both dimensions.

**Conclusion:** No significant risk due to substantial separation and low relative velocity.

#### **Obstacle 3054**
- **Position:** Front-right
- **Adjusted Distance:** Longitudinal 0.84 m, Lateral -15.68 m
- **Relative Velocity:** Longitudinal -11.15 m/s, Lateral 0.42 m/s
- **Motion Description:** Closing both longitudinally and laterally.

**Trajectory Analysis:**
- The decreasing longitudinal distance combined with lateral closing motion suggests a crossing path.

**Risk Assessment:**
  - **TTC Calculation:** Approximate TTC = 0.84 m / 11.15 m/s ≈ 0.075 s
  - **MDC Calculation:** The longitudinal component is critical here: 0.84 m

**Conclusion:** Object at immediate collision risk based on calculated TTC and MDC values.

#### **Obstacle 3055**
- **Position:** Front-left
- **Adjusted Distance:** Longitudinal 9.57 m, Lateral 1.90 m
- **Relative Velocity:** Longitudinal -11.14 m/s, Lateral -0.00 m/s
- **Motion Description:** Primarily longitudinal closing trajectory.

**Trajectory Analysis:**
- Longitudinal approach is narrowing the gap.
- Significant movement contrasting slightly increasing lateral separation.

**Risk Assessment:**
  - **TTC Calculation:** Approximate TTC = 9.57 m / 11.14 m/s ≈ 0.86 s
  - **MDC Calculation:** 9.57 m (dominated by longitudinal approach)

**Conclusion:** High risk due to the closer gap and the sustained closing velocity.

#### **Obstacle 3058**
- **Position:** Behind
- **Adjusted Distance:** Longitudinal -17.38 m, Lateral 0.00 m
- **Relative Velocity:** Longitudinal 0.62 m/s, Lateral -0.05 m/s
- **Motion Description:** Approaching from behind with exact lateral alignment.

**Trajectory Analysis:**
- Moving forward from a distance.
- Very slow approach implies low collision likelihood over short term.

**Risk Assessment:**
  - **TTC Calculation:** Not applicable for collision with diverging motion from initial negative distance.
  - **MDC Calculation:** No immediate reduction in lateral or longitudinal separation which poses collision soon.

**Conclusion:** Negligible risk due to low velocity and negative initial position relative to ego.
