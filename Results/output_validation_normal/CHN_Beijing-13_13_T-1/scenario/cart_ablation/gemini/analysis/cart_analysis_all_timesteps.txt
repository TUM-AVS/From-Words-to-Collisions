At t=0.9s, Ego (3056.0) is in lanelet 453.0 and has decelerated significantly.  Obstacle 3058.0 is in the same lanelet (151.0) as Ego was initially, and although it's also decelerating, its y-coordinate (554.1083) suggests it's still significantly behind Ego (y=575.9844).  No immediate collision is likely. Other obstacles are in different lanelets and pose no immediate threat.
