At t=0.9s, Ego is in lanelet 453. Let's analyze the latest positions and trajectories of the obstacles:

* **Obstacle 3052:** Stationary and far from Ego's current and predicted path. Low risk.
* **Obstacle 3053:**  In lanelet 154, moving with decreasing velocity. While its trajectory might eventually intersect with Ego's predicted path (given Ego's lane change to 453), it is currently sufficiently far to not pose an immediate threat. Medium risk.
* **Obstacle 3054:** Stationary and far from Ego's trajectory. Low risk.
* **Obstacle 3055:** Stationary and far from Ego's current and predicted path. Low risk.
* **Obstacle 3058:**  Located in lanelet 151, where the ego vehicle was previously.  The distance is substantial and both vehicles are moving in the same general direction, albeit with obstacle 3058 decelerating. The trajectory doesn't suggest an immediate collision risk. Low risk.
