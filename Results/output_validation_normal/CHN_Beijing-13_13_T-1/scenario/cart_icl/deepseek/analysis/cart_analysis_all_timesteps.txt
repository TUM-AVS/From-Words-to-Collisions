### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep (0.9 seconds):

### Obstacle Analysis:

1. **Obstacle ID: 3052.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Static obstacle (velocity = 0) in lanelet 127.0, far from ego's lanelet (453.0). No significant change in position over time.
   - **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: No movement, no collision risk.
   - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)

2. **Obstacle ID: 3053.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Moving away from ego (Y-coordinate increasing). In lanelet 154.0, not overlapping with ego's lanelet (453.0).
   - **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: Decelerating but still moving away. Relative velocity is negative (ego is slower).
   - **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low Risk)

3. **Obstacle ID: 3054.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Static-like (very low velocity) in lanelet 127.0, far from ego's lanelet (453.0).
   - **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: Minimal movement, no collision path.
   - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)

4. **Obstacle ID: 3055.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Static obstacle in lanelet 153.0, not in ego's path (lanelet 453.0).
   - **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: No movement, no collision risk.
   - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)

5. **Obstacle ID: 3058.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: In same lanelet (151.0) as ego's initial lanelet, but behind ego and decelerating. Ego has moved to lanelet 453.0.
   - **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: Decelerating but still closing distance. Relative velocity is positive (ego is slower).
   - **Time safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 3 (Medium Risk)

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. Ego vehicle is decelerating and has changed lanelets (from 151.0 to 453.0).
2. Obstacle 3058.0 is the only one in the same initial lanelet but is behind ego and decelerating.
3. No obstacles are in the ego's current lanelet (453.0).
4. All other obstacles are either static or moving away.
5. No immediate collision risk detected.
