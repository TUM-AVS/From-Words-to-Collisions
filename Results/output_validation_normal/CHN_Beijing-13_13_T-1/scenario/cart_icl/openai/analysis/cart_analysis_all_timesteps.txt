### Obstacle Analysis:

1. **Obstacle ID: 3052**
   - Distance Risk reason: Obstacle remains stationary throughout all timesteps, positioned in a different lanelet.
   - Distance safety score: 5
   - Time Risk reason: No velocity or acceleration, implying no movement towards the ego vehicle.
   - Time safety score: 5
   - Overall Risk score: 5

2. **Obstacle ID: 3053**
   - Distance Risk reason: Consistent movement with a trajectory slightly away from the ego's path, no proximity risks noted.
   - Distance safety score: 4
   - Time Risk reason: Decreasing velocity over time; currently moving upwards suggesting diverging paths.
   - Time safety score: 4
   - Overall Risk score: 4

3. **Obstacle ID: 3054**
   - Distance Risk reason: Mostly stationary with minimal movement, located in a separate lanelet.
   - Distance safety score: 5
   - Time Risk reason: Low and decreasing velocity, suggests it's not moving into ego path.
   - Time safety score: 5
   - Overall Risk score: 5

4. **Obstacle ID: 3055**
   - Distance Risk reason: Stationary throughout timesteps, positioned laterally far from the ego.
   - Distance safety score: 5
   - Time Risk reason: No movement or acceleration, not a time-based risk.
   - Time safety score: 5
   - Overall Risk score: 5

5. **Obstacle ID: 3057**
   - Distance Risk reason: Fully stationary and positioned away in another lanelet.
   - Distance safety score: 5
   - Time Risk reason: No movement or trajectory changes, not holding risk potential.
   - Time safety score: 5
   - Overall Risk score: 5

6. **Obstacle ID: 3058**
   - Distance Risk reason: In the same lanelet but significant distance from ego; velocity suggests moderate diverging paths.
   - Distance safety score: 4
   - Time Risk reason: Consistent decrease in speed and overall divergent trajectory.
   - Time safety score: 4
   - Overall Risk score: 4

7. **Obstacle ID: 3059 to 3062 (multiple obstacles)**
   - Distance & Time Risk reason: Positioned significantly distant and not moving towards the ego vehicleâ€™s path.
   - Distance & Time safety score: 5
   - Overall Risk score: 5

8. **Obstacle ID: 3063**
   - Distance Risk reason: Faster moving, but within a different lanelet; trajectory shows movement away or parallel.
   - Distance safety score: 4
   - Time Risk reason: Consistent velocity decrease points to non-converging paths.
   - Time safety score: 4
   - Overall Risk score: 4

9. **Obstacle ID: 3064 to 3071 (multiple obstacles)**
   - Distance & Time Risk reason: Positioned in different lanelets, maintaining a reasonable safety margin, or showing diverging trajectories.
   - Distance & Time safety score: 4-5 depending on proximity and velocity trends.
   - Overall Risk score: Highly context-dependent but no extreme risks identified beyond medium to low risk.

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. **Collision Potential**: Analyzed obstacles do not exhibit immediate threat for collision based on their positions, distinct lanelets, and non-converging trajectories.
2. **Movement and Risk Assessment**: Most moving obstacles are diverging or deaccelerating, reducing the risk of future collision.
3. **Concluding Assessment**: The scenario primarily shows controlled and divergent movements, no collision or extreme risks identified for the ego vehicle.
