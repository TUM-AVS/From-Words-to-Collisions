Obstacle 3052 is very close to the ego vehicle, with a longitudinal distance of only 0.79 meters at the most recent timestep (0.9 seconds). It is approaching the ego car longitudinally at -11.14 m/s.  Obstacle 3054 is also extremely close at 0.84 meters longitudinally and approaching at -11.15 m/s. Given these small distances and closing velocities, a collision is highly likely in the next timestep.

**Risk Levels and Definitions:**
Collision (Score: 0): Actual collision has occurred or is unavoidable within the next timestep.
Extreme Risk (Score: 1): Immediate collision or very high likelihood of impact. Urgent action is required.
High Risk (Score: 2): Close to collision or highly probable collision path. Needs prompt attention and quick manoeuvring.
Medium Risk (Score: 3): Moderate collision risk but manageable with timely reactions and proper strategies.
Low Risk (Score: 4): Minimal collision risk. The situation is controllable with sufficient time to react.
Negligible Risk (Score: 5): No significant collision risk. Obstacles are either moving away or far enough not to interfere.
