### Safety analysis for timestep 0.9 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

**Assumptions and Clarifications:**

* Since "adjusted distances" are explicitly requested but not provided in the scenario context, the provided real distances (DTClong, DTClat) will be used directly.  This analysis would be significantly improved with the adjusted distances.
* TTC will be approximated using distance/relative velocity.  This simplification assumes constant velocity, which is not entirely accurate given the provided accelerations, but is sufficient for a coarse-grained analysis without more sophisticated trajectory prediction.  Negative TTC values indicate the obstacle is moving away or the relative velocity is zero. 
* A simplified risk assessment logic will be used based on distance and TTC thresholds.  More complex scenarios might necessitate fuzzy logic or machine learning models for risk assessment.


### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 3052**
- Distance Risk reason: Extremely close (0.79m longitudinal and lateral) in the front-right and moving towards the ego vehicle.
- Distance safety score: 1
- Time Risk reason: Very low TTC, indicating imminent collision. Approximated TTClong: 0.79m / 11.14m/s ≈ 0.07s.
- Time safety score: 1
- Overall Risk score: 1

- **Obstacle ID: 3053**
- Distance Risk reason: Relatively far (20.67m longitudinal and lateral) in front.  
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Relatively high TTC. Approximated TTClong: 20.67m / 0.34m/s ≈ 60.79s.  This is a very long TTC due to the low closing velocity.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 3054**
- Distance Risk reason: Extremely close (0.84m longitudinal and lateral) in the front-right, moving towards the ego vehicle.
- Distance safety score: 1
- Time Risk reason: Very low TTC, indicating imminent collision. Approximated TTClong: 0.84m / 11.15m/s ≈ 0.075s.
- Time safety score: 1
- Overall Risk score: 1

- **Obstacle ID: 3055**
- Distance Risk reason: Moderately close (9.57m longitudinal and lateral) in the front-left and moving towards the ego vehicle.
- Distance safety score: 2
- Time Risk reason: Low TTC. Approximated TTClong: 9.57m / 11.14m/s ≈ 0.86s.
- Time safety score: 2
- Overall Risk score: 2

- **Obstacle ID: 3058**
- Distance Risk reason: Relatively far behind (-17.38m longitudinal and lateral). Note: the negative sign implies the obstacle is behind the ego vehicle.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Negative TTC due to opposite direction of travel relative to ego.  Approximated TTClong: -17.38m / 0.62m/s ≈ -28.03s.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5


### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
  "CollisionObstacle": null,
  "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {
    "ObstacleID": ["3052", "3054"],
    "OverallRiskScore": "1"
  },
  "IsCollisionScenario": false,
  "Justification": "Obstacles 3052 and 3054 present extreme risks due to their very close proximity and high closing speeds. Although collision isn't guaranteed, the probability is exceptionally high within the next time step.  No obstacle is in a definite collision state (overlapping with the ego vehicle) in this specific time step."
