* **Obstacle 3052 Analysis:**

    * **Trajectory:** This obstacle has been consistently approaching the ego vehicle from the front-right.  The longitudinal distance has decreased significantly over the past 0.9 seconds, from 11.46m to 0.79m.  Lateral distance remains constant at -7.77m, indicating parallel movement in that dimension.
    * **TTC (Longitudinal):** 0.79m / 11.14m/s = 0.07 seconds.
    * **MDC:** Approximately 0.79m (using longitudinal distance as the primary metric, given the near-zero longitudinal distance and the fact that lateral distance is larger).
    * **Risk:** Extreme Risk (1) due to extremely low TTC and MDC.  A collision is imminent.

* **Obstacle 3053 Analysis:**

    * **Trajectory:** This obstacle is in front of the ego vehicle and has a slowly decreasing longitudinal distance. However, it's important to note that the relative longitudinal velocity is very low and even becomes close to zero or slightly positive at some timesteps. This means it is not a significant threat at present, although monitoring is necessary.
    * **TTC (Longitudinal):** 20.67m / 0.34 m/s = 60.79 seconds (note the low closing velocity)
    * **MDC:** 20.67m (using longitudinal distance due to near-zero lateral distance)
    * **Risk:** No Risk (5) due to large TTC and MDC and low relative velocity.

* **Obstacle 3054 Analysis:**

    * **Trajectory:** Similar to Obstacle 3052, this obstacle approaches rapidly from the front-right.  Longitudinal distance has decreased significantly to 0.84m, while the lateral distance is larger but also decreasing.
    * **TTC (Longitudinal):** 0.84m / 11.15m/s = 0.07 seconds.
    * **MDC:** Approximately 0.84m (using longitudinal distance as the primary metric, given the near-zero longitudinal distance).
    * **Risk:** Extreme Risk (1) due to extremely low TTC and MDC. Collision is highly likely without immediate intervention.

* **Obstacle 3055 Analysis:**

    * **Trajectory:** This obstacle is approaching from the front-left.  The longitudinal distance is decreasing, and lateral distance remains relatively stable and small at 1.9m.
    * **TTC (Longitudinal):** 9.57m / 11.14m/s = 0.86 seconds.
    * **MDC:** Approximately 1.90m (using lateral distance).
    * **Risk:** High Risk (2) due to low TTC, MDC is small as well but doesn't pose as immediate a threat as 3052 and 3054.

* **Obstacle 3058 Analysis:**

    * **Trajectory:** This obstacle is behind the ego vehicle and approaching slowly. The longitudinal distance is decreasing very gradually.
    * **TTC (Longitudinal):** 17.38m / 0.62m/s = 28.03 seconds.
    * **MDC:** 17.38m (using longitudinal distance).
    * **Risk:** No Risk (5) given the large TTC and MDC and low closing velocity.

**Collision Scenario Determination:**

Yes, this is a collision scenario. Obstacles 3052 and 3054 both present Extreme Risk (1) with extremely low TTCs and MDCs, indicating near-certain collisions within the next second if trajectories are maintained.
