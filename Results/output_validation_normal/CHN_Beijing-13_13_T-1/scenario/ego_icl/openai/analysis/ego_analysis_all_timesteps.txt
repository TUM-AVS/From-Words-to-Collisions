**Analysis of Most Recent Timestep (0.9 seconds):**

**Obstacle 3052:**
- **Location:** Front-right
- **Adjusted Distances:** Longitudinal 0.79 m, Lateral -7.77 m
- **Relative Velocities:** Longitudinal -11.14 m/s, Lateral 0.00 m/s
- **Motion:** Obstacle is approaching ego vehicle longitudinally, no lateral relative motion
- **Trajectory & Past Timesteps:** This obstacle consistently approaches closer over time in longitudinal distance, with distance decreasing.
- **Calculation:**
  - **TTC (Longitudinal):** Distance / |Velocity| = 0.79 m / 11.14 m/s = 0.071 s
  - **MDC:** Primarily longitudinal as no lateral change, MDC = 0.79 m
  - **Risk Assessment:** TTC and MDC both narrow (TTC < 0.5 seconds), so Extreme Risk (1).

**Obstacle 3053:**
- **Location:** Front
- **Adjusted Distances:** Longitudinal 20.67 m, Lateral 0.00 m
- **Relative Velocities:** Longitudinal -0.34 m/s, Lateral 0.05 m/s
- **Motion:** Approaching ego vehicle longitudinally.
- **Trajectory & Past Timesteps:** The obstacle trends towards the ego, but the closing velocity is very low.
- **Calculation:**
  - **TTC (Longitudinal):** Distance / |Velocity| = 20.67 m / 0.34 m/s = 60.79 s (effectively, not a threat due to low closing speed)
  - **MDC:** Given alignment but low speed, value high (MDC > 5.0 m)
  - **Risk Assessment:** No immediate crash risk. No Risk (5).

**Obstacle 3054:**
- **Location:** Front-right
- **Adjusted Distances:** Longitudinal 0.84 m, Lateral -15.68 m
- **Relative Velocities:** Longitudinal -11.15 m/s, Lateral 0.42 m/s
- **Motion:** Approaching longitudinally and from the lateral right.
- **Trajectory & Past Timesteps:** Consistent approach trajectory seen over time.
- **Calculation:**
  - **TTC (Longitudinal):** Distance / |Velocity| = 0.84 m / 11.15 m/s = 0.075 s
  - **MDC (Longitudinal):** 0.84 m (particularly concerning due to converging lateral motion)
  - **Risk Assessment:** Both MDC and TTC critical, Extreme Risk (1).

**Obstacle 3055:**
- **Location:** Front-left
- **Adjusted Distances:** Longitudinal 9.57 m, Lateral 1.90 m
- **Relative Velocities:** Longitudinal -11.14 m/s, Lateral 0.00 m/s
- **Motion:** Approaching longitudinally, stable laterally.
- **Trajectory & Past Timesteps:** The longitudinal trajectory shows closing distance.
- **Calculation:**
  - **TTC (Longitudinal):** Distance / |Velocity| = 9.57 m / 11.14 m/s = 0.86 s
  - **MDC:** With lateral stability, MDC = 9.57 m
  - **Risk Assessment:** High Risk (2) due to significant longitudinal risk.

**Obstacle 3058:**
- **Location:** Behind
- **Adjusted Distances:** Longitudinal -17.38 m, Lateral 0.00 m
- **Relative Velocities:** Longitudinal 0.62 m/s, Lateral -0.05 m/s
- **Motion:** Approaching from behind very slowly, exact lateral alignment.
- **Trajectory & Past Timesteps:** Negligible risk trend towards ego.
- **Calculation:**
  - **TTC (Longitudinal):** Not critical due to very low convergence speed.
  - **MDC:** Minimum Convergence unlikely and negligible for imminent collision.
  - **Risk Assessment:** No Risk (5).

**Conclusion:**
- There are two obstacles with significant collision risk: Obstacle 3052 and Obstacle 3054 both present an extreme risk due to their small MDC and very short TTC, which marks this scenario as concerning.
