The ego vehicle and obstacle 3052 are in different lanelets and appear to be on a converging course. While the y-coordinates are similar, suggesting they might be approaching an intersection or merge point, the x-coordinate difference is decreasing over time. This indicates a potential collision risk. The ego vehicle is decelerating significantly while the obstacle maintains a relatively constant velocity.  A more detailed analysis involving lane geometry and future predictions is needed to accurately assess the risk, but based on the provided data, the risk appears to be increasing.  Furthermore, the ego vehicle changes lanelets at t=0.5, suggesting a maneuver which could further complicate the situation depending on the lanelet geometry and relationship between lanelets 9, 301 and 127.
