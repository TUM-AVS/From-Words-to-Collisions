Here's a breakdown of the collision analysis at t=0.9s:

**1. Scenario Understanding**

The ego vehicle and obstacle 3052 are moving in roughly parallel paths but separated laterally. The ego vehicle is decelerating significantly, while the obstacle maintains a relatively constant velocity.  Both are oriented in similar directions. The lanelet changes for the ego vehicle might indicate lane-changing behavior.

**2. Metric Calculation at t=0.9s**

* **Position:**
    * Ego: (484.3506, 582.9795)
    * Obstacle 3052: (465.454, 582.1883)

* **Distance:** Using the distance formula, the distance between the ego and obstacle is approximately 18.92 meters.

* **Velocity:**
    * Ego: 6.6188 (we don't have directional components, but they appear roughly aligned)
    * Obstacle 3052: 11.3057

* **TTC (Approximation):** Since we are missing directional velocity components, a precise TTC calculation is impossible. However, considering their lateral positions (y-coordinates), the lateral TTC is very large (approaching infinity) as they're moving almost parallel in the Y direction.  Longitudinally, a rough estimate can be made assuming the vehicles are moving directly towards each other, but this is unlikely given the data: TTC ≈ (484.3506 - 465.454)/(11.3057+ 6.6188) ≈  1 second. This is an overestimate.  The obstacle's y-coordinate consistently is less than the ego vehicle's, which suggests a low risk of collision.  If more precise velocity information were available (x and y components), the TTC could be calculated accurately.

* **MDC (Minimum Distance Calculation):**  The minimum distance is simply calculated as 18.92 meter at t=0.9s.


**3. Reasoning and Risk Assessment**

Although the calculated approximate TTC (1 sec) is on the shorter end, the following factors heavily mitigate the risk:

* **Lateral Separation:** The vehicles' Y coordinates indicate sufficient lateral separation.
* **Parallel Trajectories:** Both vehicles are moving in roughly parallel trajectories, reducing the chance of a collision. The vehicles' orientation also support this.
* **Lanelet Information:** Different lanelets often indicate physical separation.



**4. Collision Prediction**

No immediate collision is predicted.
