### Analysis:

1. **Ego Vehicle (3054.0) and Obstacle (3052.0) Trajectories**:
   - The ego vehicle is decelerating (negative acceleration) from an initial velocity of 10.6133 m/s to 6.6188 m/s over 0.9 seconds.
   - The obstacle (3052.0) is moving at a relatively constant velocity (~11.27 m/s) with minor fluctuations in acceleration.
   - The obstacle is in lanelet 127.0, while the ego vehicle transitions from lanelet 9.0 to lanelet 301.0. The lanelets suggest the vehicles are not in the same lane, but their paths may intersect or run parallel.

2. **Relative Motion**:
   - At 0.9 seconds:
     - Ego position: (484.3506, 582.9795)
     - Obstacle position: (465.454, 582.1883)
     - The lateral distance (Y-coordinate difference) is ~0.7912 m, which is relatively small.
     - The longitudinal distance (X-coordinate difference) is ~18.8966 m, with the obstacle behind the ego vehicle.
     - The obstacle is moving faster (~11.3057 m/s) than the ego vehicle (~6.6188 m/s), but the lateral distance suggests they are not on a direct collision course.

3. **Time to Collision (TTC)**:
   - Relative longitudinal velocity: 11.3057 m/s (obstacle) - 6.6188 m/s (ego) = 4.6869 m/s (closing speed).
   - TTC = Longitudinal distance / Relative velocity = 18.8966 / 4.6869 â‰ˆ 4.03 seconds.
   - A TTC of 4.03 seconds indicates a manageable risk (Medium to Low).

4. **Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC)**:
   - The lateral distance (~0.7912 m) is small but not zero, suggesting no immediate collision risk.
   - The vehicles are not in the same lane, and their paths are not converging rapidly.

### Risk Assessment:
- The obstacle (3052.0) poses a **Low Risk (4)** due to the significant longitudinal distance and manageable TTC. The lateral distance is small but not indicative of an imminent collision.
