The ego vehicle appears to be decelerating while the obstacle maintains a relatively constant velocity.  At the last timestep (0.9s), the obstacle is located at (465.454, 582.1883) while the ego is at (484.3506, 582.9795). This places the obstacle approximately 18.9 meters behind the ego in the x-direction and slightly below it in the y-direction.  Given the lanelets, it can be assumed the vehicles are traveling roughly parallel, but the obstacle is in a neighboring lane.

Rough estimates of relative velocity and TTC:

* **Relative X Velocity:**  Ego is slowing while the obstacle maintains speed.  A rough estimate is 11.3 m/s (obstacle) - 6.6 m/s (ego) = 4.7 m/s.

* **TTC (Longitudinal, approximate):** -18.9m / 4.7 m/s = -4 seconds. The negative value indicates the obstacle is behind and closing, but not imminently. The time to collision of more than 3 seconds in this case suggests there is ample time to react. However, lane changes or significant deviations in either vehicle's current trajectory could increase risk.

* **Lateral Distance:**  Approximately 0.8 meters which is rather close.  This warrants monitoring.


Given these observations, the risk at this specific timestep is low, despite the proximity. Continued monitoring of the relative motion is crucial, as small changes in acceleration or lateral movement by either vehicle could rapidly increase the risk level.
