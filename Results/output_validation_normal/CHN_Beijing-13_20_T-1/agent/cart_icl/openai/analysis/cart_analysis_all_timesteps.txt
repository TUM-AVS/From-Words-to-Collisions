In analyzing the provided scenario, we will evaluate the potential collision risk based on the trajectory of the Ego vehicle (ID: 3054.0) and the obstacle (ID: 3052.0) over the recorded time steps, with a focus on the most recent timestamp at 0.9 seconds. Below is a detailed evaluation considering the metrics defined:

### Evaluation at 0.9 seconds:

1. **Position and Orientation:**
   - **Ego Vehicle (ID: 3054.0):** Positioned at (484.3506, 582.9795) with orientation -3.0986 radians.
   - **Obstacle (ID: 3052.0):** Positioned at (465.454, 582.1883) with orientation -3.1 radians.
   - The Ego Vehicle and the obstacle are located significantly apart in terms of their lanelets (Ego in 301.0, Obstacle in 127.0) which suggests they are not on a direct collision path given their current orientations.

2. **Velocity and Acceleration:**
   - **Ego Vehicle:** Velocity is 6.6188 m/s, reducing (negative acceleration of -2.1593).
   - **Obstacle:** Velocity is relatively high at 11.3057 m/s with positive acceleration of 0.9649, indicating a steady or slightly increasing speed.
   - The relative speed difference suggests the Ego vehicle is slowing down faster than the obstacle, meaning the gap is likely increasing over time.

3. **Distance and Relative Motion:**
   - The longitudinal difference between the Ego vehicle and the obstacle is approximately 18.8966 meters (484.3506 - 465.454).
   - Given the lateral positioning in different lanelets and the distance, no immediate collision risk is present.

4. **Time to Collision (TTC) and Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC):**
   - **TTC:** As the obstacle is not on a direct collision course in the same lanelet, TTC is not calculable in terms of a collision path.
   - **MDC:** With a lateral discrepancy in lanelets, the minimum distance is not zero nor approaching collision.

### Conclusion:
Assessing these metrics collectively, the obstacle presents no immediate threat due to the significant longitudinal and lateral separation, alongside distinct lanelets indicating independent motions. Risk levels for collision are low to negligible.

### JSON Output:
Given the analysis, no risk of collision is flagged at a level requiring immediate action (0 or 1 scores).

```json
{
    "CollisionObstacles": [],
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {},
    "HighRiskObstacle": {}
}
```

This output confirms that under the current trajectory data provided, there is no indication of collision or extreme risk conditions present.
