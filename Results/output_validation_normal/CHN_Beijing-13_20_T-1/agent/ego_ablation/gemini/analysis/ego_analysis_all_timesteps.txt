The obstacle is moving away from the ego vehicle, increasing in longitudinal distance over each time step.  The lateral distance remains at 0.0, indicating the obstacle is directly in front of the ego vehicle. While the relative velocity is increasing, the relative acceleration is negative, meaning the obstacle is decelerating relative to the ego vehicle. At the last timestep (0.9 seconds), the obstacle is 14.41 meters away and moving away with a speed of 4.69 m/s. It appears to be slowing down, evident from the negative relative acceleration. Given the information, there is no immediate risk of collision.
