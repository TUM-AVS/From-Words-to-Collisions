### Safety analysis for timestep 0.9s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 3052
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 3052 is located at 14.41 meters longitudinally and laterally in front of the ego vehicle at the last timestep (0.9 seconds). This substantial distance indicates a negligible risk of collision based on distance alone. The obstacle's movement away from the ego vehicle further reduces collision risk. 
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Considering that the obstacle is moving away from the ego vehicle with increasing longitudinal velocity, the time to collision (TTC) is effectively infinite. This indicates no risk of collision based on the time metric.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5
