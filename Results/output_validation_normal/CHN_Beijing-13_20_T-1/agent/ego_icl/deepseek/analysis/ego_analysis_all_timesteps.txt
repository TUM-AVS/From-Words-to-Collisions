### Obstacle Analysis: Obstacle 3052

#### Trajectory Analysis:
- **Direction**: Front of the ego car (longitudinal alignment)
- **Longitudinal Distance**: Increasing from 12.54m to 14.41m over 0.9 seconds
- **Lateral Distance**: Consistently 0.00m (exact lateral alignment)
- **Relative Velocity (Longitudinal)**: Positive and increasing (0.94 m/s to 4.69 m/s), indicating the obstacle is moving away from the ego vehicle.
- **Relative Velocity (Lateral)**: Very small (-0.04 m/s to -0.02 m/s), negligible lateral movement.
- **Motion Description**: "Obstacle is moving away longitudinally. Exact lateral alignment or unknown case."

#### Risk Assessment:
1. **Proximity**: 
   - Longitudinal distance is increasing (14.41m at the last timestep).
   - Lateral distance is 0.00m but stable (no closing velocity).

2. **Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC)**:
   - Since the obstacle is moving away longitudinally and the lateral distance is stable, the MDC is effectively the current longitudinal distance (14.41m), which is > 5.0m. This falls under **Negligible Risk (5)**.

3. **Time-to-Collision (TTC)**:
   - The relative longitudinal velocity is 4.69 m/s (moving away), so TTC is not applicable (diverging paths).
   - The lateral relative velocity is negligible (-0.02 m/s), so no TTC concern.
   - This also falls under **Negligible Risk (5)**.

4. **Overall Risk**:
   - Both MDC and TTC indicate **Negligible Risk (5)**.
   - The obstacle is moving away with no closing velocity in any dimension.

### Conclusion:
- No collision or extreme/high-risk obstacles detected.
- Obstacle 3052 poses negligible risk as it is moving away from the ego vehicle with no closing velocity.
