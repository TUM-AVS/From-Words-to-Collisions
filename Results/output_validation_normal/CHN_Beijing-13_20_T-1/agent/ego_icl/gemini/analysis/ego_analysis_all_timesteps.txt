Obstacle 3052 is in front of the ego vehicle and moving away.  The longitudinal distance is increasing over each timestep, from 12.54m to 14.41m at the last timestep.  The lateral distance remains at 0.00m throughout, indicating the obstacle stays in the same lane as the ego vehicle. Since the relative longitudinal velocity is positive and increasing (from 0.94 m/s to 4.69 m/s), meaning obstacle gets faster than ego vehicle, but the distance is also increasing, so the risk is negligible.

Given the increasing longitudinal distance and the obstacle moving away, the TTC is not applicable in a collision avoidance context.  The MDC is effectively the lateral distance of 0.00m, but since there's no lateral movement and the longitudinal distance is increasing, there is no risk of collision.
