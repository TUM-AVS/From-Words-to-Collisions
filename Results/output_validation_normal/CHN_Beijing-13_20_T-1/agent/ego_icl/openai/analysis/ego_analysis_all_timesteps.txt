### Obstacle 3052 Analysis:

**Trajectory Analysis:**
- Obstacle 3052 is consistently moving away from the ego vehicle with increasing longitudinal distances over time.
- The obstacle is directly in front of the ego vehicle with a lateral alignment of 0.00m, indicating they are in the same lane.
- The longitudinal distance increased from 12.54m at 0.1 seconds to 14.41m at 0.9 seconds, indicating an overall diverging path.

**Most Recent Timestep (0.9 seconds):**
- **Adjusted Longitudinal Distance:** Not provided for this exact instruction; assume raw for understanding distances
- **Longitudinal Distance:** 14.41m
- **Lateral Distance:** 0.00m
- **Relative Longitudinal Velocity:** +4.69 m/s (moving away)
- **Relative Lateral Velocity:** -0.02 m/s
- **Relative Longitudinal Acceleration:** -3.12 m/s²
- **Relative Lateral Acceleration:** -0.13 m/s²

**Calculations & Assessments:**

1. **Time-to-Collision (TTC):**
   - **TTC (Longitudinal)** = Longitudinal Distance / |Relative Longitudinal Velocity| 
   - TTC = 14.41m / 4.69m/s ≈ 3.07 seconds
   - **TTC (Lateral):** Not critical due to zero lateral velocity indicating non-converging paths

2. **Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC):**
   - MDC is primarily considered longitudinally because both lateral alignment is 0.00m and obstacle moves away.
   - Since paths are diverging, and no closing velocity is present, MDC remains effectively the longitudinal distance, 14.41m.

3. **Risk Assessment:**
   - **TTC of 3.07 seconds** and increasing indicates a medium risk (3), primarily due to its trajectory moving away.
   - **MDC > 5.0m** suggests negligible risk (5).
   - Given the diverging path, and both dimensions surpassing critical thresholds, the **lowest score (highest risk level)** is a **medium risk (3)**.

### Conclusion:

- **Obstacle 3052 exhibits no immediate or significant risk of collision** as it moves increasingly away from the ego vehicle with sufficient time and space between them.
- **Overall, Obstacle 3052 is assessed at a Medium Risk Level.**
