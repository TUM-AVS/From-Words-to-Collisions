At t=0.9s, the ego vehicle is at (484.3506, 582.9795) in lanelet 301, and the obstacle (ID 3052) is at (465.454, 582.1883) in lanelet 127. While the y-coordinates are close, suggesting potential lateral proximity, the x-coordinates show a separation of roughly 19 meters.  Given the observed velocities and accelerations, this distance is unlikely to close to a dangerous level within the immediate future (next timestep).  Though the ego vehicle is decelerating significantly, the obstacle is maintaining a relatively constant velocity. Based on the current trajectories, a collision or extreme risk is not imminent.
