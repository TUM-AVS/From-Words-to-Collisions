At t=0.9s, Ego is at (484.3506, 582.9795) in lanelet 301 and Obstacle 3052 is at (465.454, 582.1883) in lanelet 127.  While the y-coordinates are close, the x-coordinates are separated by approximately 19 meters.  Examining previous timesteps reveals that the x-distance between Ego and Obstacle is decreasing, but not rapidly enough to suggest an imminent collision in the next timestep. Both are moving forward, with the obstacle moving slightly faster than the ego vehicle, and there isn't a sharp change in orientation or velocity suggesting an immediate risk.  Based on current positions, velocities, and the rate of change in distance, no collision is imminent.
