### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep (0.9 seconds):

### Obstacle Analysis:
- **Obstacle ID**: 3052.0  
  - **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is in lanelet 127.0, while the ego vehicle is in lanelet 301.0. The lateral distance is significant, and the obstacle is moving away longitudinally (distance increasing over time).  
  - **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)  
  - **Time Risk reason**: The obstacle's velocity (~11.3 m/s) is higher than the ego's (~6.6 m/s), and the relative distance is increasing. No convergence in trajectories observed.  
  - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)  
  - **Overall Risk score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)  

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. **Lanelet Analysis**: Ego and obstacle are in different lanelets (301.0 vs. 127.0), indicating no immediate shared path.  
2. **Trajectory Trends**: Obstacle is consistently moving away longitudinally (distance increases from ~18m to ~19m over 0.9s).  
3. **Velocity/Acceleration**: Ego is decelerating, while the obstacle maintains a higher speed. No risk of convergence.  
4. **Collision Check**: No overlap in positions or trajectories.
