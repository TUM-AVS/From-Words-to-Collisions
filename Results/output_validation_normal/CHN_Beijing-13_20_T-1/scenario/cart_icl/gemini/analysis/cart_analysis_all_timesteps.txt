- Time Risk reason:  Relative speeds and accelerations do not indicate any risk of collision in the near future.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 3058.0
- Distance Risk reason: This obstacle is far from the ego vehicle and in a different lanelet.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason:  Relative velocities and accelerations do not indicate any immediate collision risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5



### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
No obstacle poses an immediate collision risk. All obstacles are in different lanelets and maintain safe distances from the ego vehicle. Therefore, this is not a collision scenario.
