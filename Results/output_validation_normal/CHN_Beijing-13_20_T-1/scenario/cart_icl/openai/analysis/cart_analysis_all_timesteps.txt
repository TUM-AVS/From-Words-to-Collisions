- **Time Risk Reason:** Consistent velocity with no trajectory crossing.
- **Time Safety Score:** 5 (Negligible risk)
- **Overall Risk Score:** 5

#### Obstacle ID: 3058
- **Distance Risk Reason:** Positioned in a separate lane and moving further away, maintaining safe distance.
- **Distance Safety Score:** 5 (Negligible risk)
- **Time Risk Reason:** The obstacle is decelerating and not in a confluent path with the ego.
- **Time Safety Score:** 5 (Negligible risk)
- **Overall Risk Score:** 5

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
Based on the trajectory patterns, velocities, and orientations over the last timesteps, none of the obstacles is on a collision course with the ego vehicle. All obstacles are either maintaining a safe distance or are in separate lanes, with no apparent risk of immediate collision.
