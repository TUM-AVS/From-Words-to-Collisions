Obstacle 3052 is moving away from the ego vehicle longitudinally and there is no lateral movement. The longitudinal distance is increasing, and the relative velocity, although positive (moving away), shows deceleration. However, the distance is substantial, and the obstacle's motion suggests no immediate risk.
