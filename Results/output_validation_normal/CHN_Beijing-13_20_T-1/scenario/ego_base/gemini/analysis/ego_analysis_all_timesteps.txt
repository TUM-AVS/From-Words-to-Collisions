At t=0.9s, obstacle 3052 is moving away from the ego vehicle with a longitudinal velocity of 4.69 m/s and increasing distance (14.41m).  The lateral distance is 0.0m, suggesting the obstacle is directly ahead. While the relative acceleration is negative, indicating some deceleration, the obstacle's motion and increasing distance suggest no immediate collision risk.
