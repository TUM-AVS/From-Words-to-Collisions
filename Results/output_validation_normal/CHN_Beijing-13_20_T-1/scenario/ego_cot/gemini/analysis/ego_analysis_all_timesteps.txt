### Safety analysis for timestep 0.9 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:
- **Obstacle ID:** 3052
- **Distance Risk reason:** Obstacle 3052 is located in front of the ego vehicle at a lateral distance of 14.41m and a longitudinal distance of 14.41m.  Given it's positioned diagonally and moving away from the ego vehicle both longitudinally and laterally, the risk posed by its current distance is negligible.
- **Distance safety score:** 5
- **Time Risk reason:** The obstacle is moving away longitudinally with an increasing velocity, indicating a decreasing risk of collision over time. The lateral velocity is minimal and also directed away from the ego vehicle. This suggests no imminent time-based risk.
- **Time safety score:** 5
- **Overall Risk score:** 5
