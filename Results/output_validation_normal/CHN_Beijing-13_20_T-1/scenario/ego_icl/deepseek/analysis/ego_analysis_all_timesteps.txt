### Obstacle-by-Obstacle Analysis (Most Recent Timestep: 0.9s)

#### Obstacle 3052:
- **Position**: Front of ego car  
- **Adjusted Distances**: Longitudinal = 14.41 m, Lateral = 0.00 m  
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal = 4.69 m/s (moving away), Lateral = -0.02 m/s (negligible)  
- **Relative Acceleration**: Longitudinal = -3.12 m/s² (decelerating away), Lateral = -0.13 m/s² (negligible)  
- **Motion Description**: Obstacle is moving away longitudinally. Exact lateral alignment.  

#### Trajectory Analysis:
- Over the last 0.9 seconds, the obstacle has consistently moved away from the ego vehicle longitudinally (distance increased from 12.54 m to 14.41 m).  
- The lateral distance remains 0.00 m, but the obstacle is not moving toward the ego laterally (relative velocity is -0.02 m/s, meaning slight movement away).  

#### TTC Calculation:
- **Longitudinal TTC**: Not applicable (relative velocity is positive, meaning the obstacle is moving away).  
- **Lateral TTC**: Not applicable (relative velocity is negative, meaning the obstacle is moving slightly away laterally).  

#### MDC Calculation:
- **Longitudinal MDC**: 14.41 m (No Risk, MDC > 5.0 m).  
- **Lateral MDC**: 0.00 m (but trajectories are diverging, so no collision risk).  

#### Risk Assessment:
- **Primary Risk**: No Risk (5)  
  - The obstacle is moving away in both longitudinal and lateral directions.  
  - No convergence in trajectories.  

### Conclusion:
This is **not** a collision scenario. The only obstacle (3052) is moving away from the ego vehicle in both dimensions, and there is no indication of imminent collision or extreme risk.
