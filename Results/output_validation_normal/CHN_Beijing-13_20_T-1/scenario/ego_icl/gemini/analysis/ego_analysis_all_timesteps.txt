Obstacle 3052 Analysis:

Trajectory Analysis: Across the provided timesteps (0.1s to 0.9s), Obstacle 3052 consistently remains in front of the ego vehicle.  The longitudinal distance is increasing, indicating the obstacle is moving away from the ego vehicle. The lateral distance remains at 0.00 m, indicating perfect lateral alignment. However, as the obstacle is moving *away* from the ego vehicle longitudinally, this alignment does not pose a collision risk.

TTC Calculation: Since the relative longitudinal velocity is positive (obstacle moving away), TTC is not applicable in the longitudinal direction.  Lateral velocity is negligible and the distance is zero, so lateral TTC is also not meaningful in this case.

MDC Calculation: Given the obstacle's position directly in front of the ego vehicle and the fact that it's moving away, the primary concern would be lateral distance. In this case, the lateral distance is 0.00m. However, since the obstacle is moving away longitudinally, a collision is not indicated.  The longitudinal distance at the last timestep (0.9s) is 14.41m.

Risk Assessment:

* Longitudinal Risk: No Risk (5) - Obstacle is moving away from the ego vehicle.
* Lateral Risk: No Risk (5) - While there is lateral alignment, the longitudinal movement of the obstacle away from the ego vehicle negates the risk.

Overall Risk: No Risk (5)

Collision Scenario Determination:  This is NOT a collision scenario. No obstacle exhibits a risk score of 0 or 1.
