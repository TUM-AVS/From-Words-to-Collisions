The ego vehicle and obstacle 3074 are in the same lanelet and the obstacle is behind the ego vehicle.  The distance between them is decreasing over time. Let's analyze the longitudinal distance:

* **t=0.1s:** Distance ≈ 540.4568 - 522.4712 = 17.9856
* **t=0.2s:** Distance ≈ 538.8196 - 520.6473 = 18.1723
* **t=0.3s:** Distance ≈ 537.2261 - 518.8627 = 18.3634
* **t=0.4s:** Distance ≈ 535.6769 - 517.1198 = 18.5571
* **t=0.5s:** Distance ≈ 534.1693 - 515.4159 = 18.7534
* **t=0.6s:** Distance ≈ 532.7127 - 513.7526 = 18.9601
* **t=0.7s:** Distance ≈ 531.3 - 512.1321 = 19.1679
* **t=0.8s:** Distance ≈ 529.9253 - 510.552 = 19.3733
* **t=0.9s:** Distance ≈ 528.5958 - 509.008 = 19.5878


Although the obstacle is behind the ego vehicle, and both are decelerating, the *distance between them is increasing*, not decreasing.  Furthermore, the relative velocity is decreasing. This suggests the risk of collision is diminishing, not increasing.  Therefore, based on the provided data, there is no immediate risk of collision.
