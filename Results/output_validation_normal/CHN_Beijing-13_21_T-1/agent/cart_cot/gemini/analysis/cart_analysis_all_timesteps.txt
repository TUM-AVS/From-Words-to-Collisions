Here's a collision risk analysis of the provided scenario, focusing on the last timestep (0.9 seconds) and considering the trajectories from previous timesteps.

**Analysis at t=0.9s:**

* **Ego Position:** (528.5958, 584.9762)
* **Ego Velocity:** 12.7181 (magnitude), Orientation: -3.096343380962952 radians
* **Obstacle 3074 Position:** (509.008, 584.0915)
* **Obstacle 3074 Velocity:** 15.362 (magnitude), Orientation: -3.0962 radians

**Observations from Trajectory:**

Both Ego and Obstacle 3074 are moving in roughly the same direction (similar orientations) and in the same lanelet.  However, the obstacle is behind the ego vehicle and moving faster. The x-coordinate difference is decreasing over time, indicating a closing of the longitudinal distance. The y-coordinate difference is also small and decreasing, though much more gradually, suggesting both vehicles are moving on nearly parallel paths.  The relative velocity implies a risk of collision if this trend continues.


**Calculations:**

* **Longitudinal Distance (dx):** 528.5958 - 509.008 = 19.5878
* **Lateral Distance (dy):** 584.9762 - 584.0915 = 0.8847
* **Relative Longitudinal Velocity (dvx):** 12.7181 - 15.362 ≈ -2.6439  (Obstacle is faster)

**Time to Collision (TTC) Estimation:**

* **Longitudinal TTC:** dx / dvx ≈ 19.5878 / 2.6439 ≈ 7.4 seconds (using the magnitude of the relative velocity). This is a rough estimate, as deceleration is occurring for both vehicles, but the TTC suggests a substantial amount of time to react.

* **Lateral TTC:** With such a small and slowly changing lateral distance and similar orientations, we will prioritize the longitudinal risk assessment for this scenario.

**Minimum Distance Calculation (MDC):**

At t=0.9s, the distance is sqrt(dx^2 + dy^2) = sqrt(19.5878^2 + 0.8847^2) ≈ 19.61 meters.

**Risk Assessment:**

Considering that Obstacle 3074 is closing in on the Ego vehicle longitudinally at a moderate speed, the distances at the latest time step, and the predicted trajectories, we categorize the obstacle with:
- Obstacle 3074.0 : Risk Score 3 (Medium Risk)
