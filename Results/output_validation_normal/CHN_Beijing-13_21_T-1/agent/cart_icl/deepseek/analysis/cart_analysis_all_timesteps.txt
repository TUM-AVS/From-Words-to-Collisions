### Analysis:

1. **Relative Motion and Trends**:
   - The ego vehicle (ID: 3075) is decelerating (negative acceleration) and moving along lanelet 9.0 with a decreasing velocity.
   - The obstacle (ID: 3074) is also decelerating but at a higher rate and is moving faster than the ego vehicle. Both vehicles are in the same lanelet (9.0).

2. **Position and Distance**:
   - At the most recent timestep (0.9s), the ego is at (528.5958, 584.9762) and the obstacle is at (509.008, 584.0915).
   - The longitudinal distance between them is approximately 19.59 meters (calculated as the Euclidean distance in the X-Y plane, though the Y-difference is minimal, indicating they are nearly aligned longitudinally).

3. **Relative Velocity and TTC**:
   - Ego velocity: 12.7181 m/s (decelerating at -2.1819 m/s²).
   - Obstacle velocity: 15.362 m/s (decelerating at -3.7593 m/s²).
   - Relative velocity (obstacle approaching ego): 15.362 - 12.7181 = 2.6439 m/s.
   - Time to Collision (TTC): Distance / Relative velocity = 19.59 / 2.6439 ≈ 7.41 seconds.

4. **Risk Assessment**:
   - The TTC is relatively high (7.41s), indicating no immediate collision risk.
   - Both vehicles are decelerating, with the obstacle decelerating faster, which reduces the risk further.
   - The lateral distance is negligible (Y-difference ≈ 0.88m), but they are in the same lanelet, so the risk is primarily longitudinal.

5. **Overall Risk**:
   - Given the TTC and deceleration trends, the risk is **Low (4)**. The ego has sufficient time to react or adjust its speed if needed.
