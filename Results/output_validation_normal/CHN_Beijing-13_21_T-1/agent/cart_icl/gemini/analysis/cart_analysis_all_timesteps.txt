The ego vehicle and obstacle 3074 are in the same lanelet (lanelet 9).  At t=0.9s, the obstacle is approximately 18 meters behind the ego vehicle and traveling slightly faster.  This implies a potential overtaking scenario. Since the data provided doesn't include lateral movement or lane change information, we will assume both vehicles remain in the same lane. Based on the closing velocities, a collision is unlikely in the immediate future (next few seconds). However, the risk level is high given the current proximity and closing speeds.  More data points are needed for a definitive TTC calculation and accurate risk assessment.
