In the scenario provided, we will analyze the risk of collision between the ego vehicle and the obstacle based on the most recent timestep (0.9 seconds) and use earlier steps for trajectory trends.

### Analysis:
- **Relative Longitudinal Position at 0.9 seconds**:
  - Ego Vehicle Position: (528.5958, 584.9762)
  - Obstacle Position: (509.008, 584.0915)
  - Calculated relative longitudinal position: Ego is ahead by approximately 19.588 meters (528.5958 - 509.008).

- **Relative Velocity**:
  - Ego Velocity: 12.7181 m/s
  - Obstacle Velocity: 15.362 m/s
  - Relative velocity = Obstacle velocity - Ego velocity = 15.362 - 12.7181 = 2.6439 m/s (indicating obstacle is catching up from behind).

- **TTC (Time to Collision)**:
  - Since ego is ahead, TTC = 19.588 / 2.6439 â‰ˆ 7.41 seconds (obstacle approaching from behind; low risk given the time to react).

- **Lateral Proximity**:
  - There is minimal lateral offset, indicating both the ego and the obstacle are on a direct collision course if not managed.

- **Overall Assessment**:
  - Given the direct path and minimal lateral distance, although the obstacle is catching up, the available time to collision (TTC > 7 seconds) indicates that appropriate actions by the ego vehicle or the obstacle can negate any collision risk.
  - The braking deceleration of both the ego and the obstacle also implies a reduction in velocity, which suggests that the situation can be controlled adequately with time to respond.

### Conclusion:
The analysis shows:
- Calculated TTC and improving deceleration rates provide a buffer.
- The most recent trajectory indicates an absence of immediate threat.
- The risk of impact in a short time frame is low based on the time available and current positional data.
