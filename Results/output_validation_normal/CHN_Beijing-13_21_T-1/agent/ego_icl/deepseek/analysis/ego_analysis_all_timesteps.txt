### Analysis for Obstacle 3074:

#### Trajectory Analysis:
- **Direction**: Front of ego car (longitudinal alignment)
- **Motion**: Obstacle is moving away longitudinally (positive relative velocity)
- **Longitudinal Distance**: Increasing from 13.50m to 15.10m over 0.9 seconds
- **Lateral Distance**: Consistently 0.00m (exact lateral alignment)
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal ~2.5 m/s (moving away), Lateral 0.00 m/s (no lateral movement)
- **Relative Acceleration**: Longitudinal ~1.5-2.8 m/s² (positive, increasing separation), Lateral ~0.05-0.13 m/s² (negligible)

#### Risk Assessment:
1. **Proximity**:
   - Longitudinal: 15.10m (far)
   - Lateral: 0.00m (same lane but no convergence)

2. **Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC)**:
   - Since obstacle is moving away longitudinally and there is no lateral movement, MDC is effectively infinite (no collision course).
   - **MDC Risk**: 5 (No Risk)

3. **Time-to-Collision (TTC)**:
   - TTC is not applicable because the relative velocity is positive (obstacle moving away).
   - **TTC Risk**: 5 (No Risk)

4. **Overall Risk**:
   - The obstacle is moving away longitudinally with increasing distance and no lateral movement. There is no risk of collision.
   - **Overall Risk Score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
