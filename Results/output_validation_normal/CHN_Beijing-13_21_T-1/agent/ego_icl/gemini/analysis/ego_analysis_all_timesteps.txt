Obstacle 3074 is in front of the ego vehicle and moving away.  Across all timesteps, the longitudinal distance increases from 13.50m to 15.10m, while lateral distance remains at 0.00m. This indicates the obstacle is directly ahead of the ego vehicle and moving further away in the same lane. Since the relative longitudinal velocity is positive and increasing (2.35 m/s to 2.64 m/s), it confirms the obstacle is driving away from the ego vehicle faster than the ego is approaching it.  Given the increasing distance and positive velocity, TTC is not relevant for a collision risk assessment as their paths will not intersect.  MDC is based on the lateral distance of 0.00m. Although aligned laterally, the diverging longitudinal paths mean a collision is not expected.

Calculations (for the most recent timestep at 0.9 seconds):

- Longitudinal Distance: 15.10m
- Lateral Distance: 0.00m
- Longitudinal Relative Velocity: 2.64 m/s (moving away)
- TTC: Not applicable (diverging paths)
- MDC: Based on the lateral distance which is 0.00m

Risk Assessment:
- Since the obstacle is moving away from the ego vehicle, the risk is negligible.
