### Obstacle-by-Obstacle Analysis:

**Obstacle 3074:**

#### Trajectory Analysis:
- The obstacle is in front of the ego vehicle with longitudinal alignment, and no lateral offset is observed throughout the timesteps.
- Across the timesteps from 0.1s to 0.9s, the obstacle consistently moves away from the ego vehicle with increasing longitudinal distances: starting at 13.50 meters and reaching 15.10 meters by the last timestamp.
- The relative longitudinal velocity is positive and showing a consistent trend of the obstacle moving away from the ego vehicle, starting with 2.35 m/s and fluctuating slightly but remaining in the upward range by the last timestamp (2.64 m/s). The relative acceleration further supports the trend of moving away.

#### Time-to-Collision (TTC) Calculation:
- Since the obstacle is moving away, the TTC is effectively not applicable for a collision as the relative velocity is positive (2.64 m/s moving away). 

#### Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC) Calculation:
- MDC, in this case, describes the closest potential approach, but as the obstacle moves further away longitudinally, the MDC remains sufficiently large as the distances are continuously increasing beyond the danger threshold.

#### Risk Assessment:
- The consistent increase in the adjusted longitudinal distance and the positive relative velocity indicate the obstacle is consistently moving away.
- Since the obstacle is moving away rapidly with increasing distance, there is no significant risk of collision.
- Therefore, the risk level for Obstacle 3074 is deemed to be negligible due to the diverging path and consistent increase in distance.
