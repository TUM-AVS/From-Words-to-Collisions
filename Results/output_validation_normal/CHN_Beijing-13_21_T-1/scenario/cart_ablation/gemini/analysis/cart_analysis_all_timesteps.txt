At t=0.9s, the ego vehicle is at (528.5958, 584.9762) and the obstacle (ID 3074.0) is at (509.008, 584.0915). Both are in the same lanelet (9.0) and have similar orientations.  The x-distance between them is approximately 19.5878 meters. While the obstacle is decelerating and the ego vehicle is also decelerating, the closing rate is still significant. Given the trajectories observed over the past timesteps, the distance is shrinking and a collision is not imminent in the next instant but the risk is high. I classify this as a high risk (2) situation, but not extreme (1) as there's still time and space for avoidance maneuvers.
