At t=0.9s, the ego vehicle is at (528.5958, 584.9762) and the obstacle 3074.0 is at (509.008, 584.0915). Both are in the same lanelet and have similar orientations. The x-distance between them is approximately 19.5878 meters.  While the obstacle is decelerating, and the ego vehicle is also decelerating, the closing rate is still significant.  Given the trajectory over the past second, the vehicles are likely to be much closer at t=1.0s and potentially colliding shortly thereafter. This warrants an extreme risk assessment.

  "ScenarioAnalysis": {
    "IsCollisionScenario": false,
    "Reasoning": "Obstacle 3074.0 poses an extreme risk of collision due to the decreasing distance between the vehicles within the same lane and their current speeds and decelerations.  Collision is likely within the next few timesteps."
