### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 3074.0
- Distance Risk reason: At the last timestep (0.9 seconds), the obstacle is approximately 18.6 meters ahead of the ego vehicle in the same lanelet.  While this is a safe distance currently, the historical data shows that the obstacle and ego vehicle are both moving in the same direction and the gap between them is closing. Over the observed period, the distance has decreased consistently.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Both the ego vehicle and the obstacle are decelerating. The obstacle is decelerating at a slightly higher rate than the ego vehicle. While the current velocities suggest a moderate time to collision, the closing distance and the deceleration rates indicate an increasing risk over time.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. **Most critical obstacle:** Obstacle 3074.0 is the most critical as it is in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle and is the closest.

2. **Trajectory analysis:** Over the 10 timesteps, both the ego vehicle and obstacle 3074.0 are moving in the same general direction and are both decelerating. The obstacle consistently remains ahead of the ego vehicle, but the distance between them decreases with each timestep.

3. **Relative position, velocity, and acceleration analysis:**
    - Position: The obstacle remains ahead of the ego vehicle throughout the observed period, but the gap is closing.
    - Velocity: Both are traveling in the same direction with the obstacle having a slightly higher initial velocity.  Both decelerate over the observed period.
    - Acceleration: Both are decelerating; however the obstacle's deceleration is more pronounced than the ego vehicle's. This contributes to the decreasing gap between them.

4. **Collision determination:** Based on the current data, a collision has not occurred. However, the continuous decrease in distance combined with the deceleration rates warrants monitoring as there is a potential for collision in the future if these trends continue.

5. **Reasoning:** Though a collision hasn't happened within the analyzed timesteps, the decreasing inter-vehicle distance, coupled with the deceleration profiles indicate a medium risk level. It is crucial to monitor the subsequent movements of both vehicles as the scenario is dynamic and could rapidly evolve into a high-risk or collision situation.  A collision is not imminent, but the risk is not negligible.
