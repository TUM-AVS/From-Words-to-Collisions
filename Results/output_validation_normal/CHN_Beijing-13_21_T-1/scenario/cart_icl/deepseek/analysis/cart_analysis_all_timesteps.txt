### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:
- **Obstacle ID**: 3074.0  
  - **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is in the same lanelet (9.0) as the ego vehicle and has been consistently moving in the same direction. The distance between the ego and the obstacle has been decreasing over time (from ~19.6m at 0.1s to ~19.6m at 0.9s).  
  - **Distance safety score**: 2 (High Risk)  
  - **Time Risk reason**: The relative velocity (ego: 12.7181 m/s, obstacle: 15.362 m/s) indicates the obstacle is approaching the ego vehicle. The TTC is ~19.6m / (15.362 - 12.718) â‰ˆ 7.4s, which is manageable but decreasing. The obstacle's acceleration is negative but higher than the ego's, reducing the closing speed.  
  - **Time safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk)  
  - **Overall Risk score**: 2 (High Risk)  

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. **Lanelet Alignment**: Both ego and obstacle are in lanelet 9.0, indicating shared trajectory risk.  
2. **Distance Trend**: The distance between ego and obstacle is decreasing but remains significant (~19.6m).  
3. **Velocity/Acceleration**: The obstacle is faster but decelerating more aggressively than the ego, reducing collision likelihood.  
4. **TTC**: ~7.4s suggests no immediate collision risk, but monitoring is required.
