### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
The ego vehicle is moving forward and decelerating. None of the obstacles present a collision risk at the most recent timestep. All obstacles are either stationary and far away, moving away laterally, or in the same lane but far enough ahead and moving at similar speeds to pose no immediate threat.
