Obstacle 3074 is moving away from the ego vehicle longitudinally with increasing distance over each time step.  The lateral distance is consistently zero, indicating perfect alignment in the ego vehicle's lane. The relative velocity is positive and increasing slightly, confirming the obstacle is moving away faster than the ego vehicle or the ego vehicle is decelerating. The relative acceleration fluctuates but remains positive. This all points to a very safe situation.
