### Safety analysis for timestep 0.9 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 3074
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 3074 is located in front of the ego vehicle at a lateral distance of 15.10m and a longitudinal distance of 15.10 m.  The obstacle is moving away from the ego vehicle longitudinally. Given the significant distance and the diverging motion, there is no immediate distance-based risk.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: The obstacle is moving away from the ego vehicle, suggesting an increasing time to collision. This further reduces the risk.  We don't have explicit TTC values calculated, but the data strongly suggests a very large TTC.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5
