### Obstacle-by-Obstacle Analysis (Most Recent Timestep: 0.9s)

#### Obstacle 3074 (Front of ego car)
- **Adjusted Distances**: Longitudinal 15.10 m, Lateral 0.00 m  
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal 2.64 m/s (moving away), Lateral 0.00 m/s  
- **Motion Description**: "Obstacle is moving away longitudinally. Exact lateral alignment or unknown case."  

#### Trajectory Analysis (Across Timesteps)
- The obstacle is consistently moving away longitudinally from the ego vehicle (distance increases from 13.50 m to 15.10 m over 0.9s).  
- Lateral distance remains 0.00 m (exact alignment), but there is no lateral movement or closing velocity.  

#### TTC Calculation
- **Longitudinal TTC**: Not applicable (relative velocity is positive, meaning the obstacle is moving away).  
- **Lateral TTC**: Not applicable (no lateral movement).  

#### MDC Calculation
- **Longitudinal MDC**: 15.10 m (No Risk, MDC > 5.0 m).  
- **Lateral MDC**: 0.00 m (alignment, but no collision risk as trajectories are not converging).  

#### Risk Assessment
- **Primary Risk**: No Risk (5). The obstacle is moving away longitudinally with no lateral convergence.  
- **Secondary Risk**: No Risk (5). No collision path exists.  

### Final Determination
- No collision or extreme risk is present. The obstacle is moving away from the ego vehicle with stable alignment.
