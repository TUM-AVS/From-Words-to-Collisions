Obstacle 3074 Analysis:

Trajectory Analysis: Over the 0.9 seconds observed, Obstacle 3074 consistently remains in front of the ego vehicle and moves away longitudinally.  The lateral distance remains at 0.00 m, indicating continued alignment in the lateral direction.  The longitudinal distance increases from 13.50m to 15.10m, clearly showing divergence.

TTC Calculation: Since the relative longitudinal velocity is positive (obstacle moving away), TTC is not applicable in the longitudinal direction as the vehicles are diverging.  Lateral velocity is consistently around 0 m/s, and with a 0m lateral distance, TTC is undefined but not relevant due to longitudinal divergence.

MDC Calculation:  Given the obstacle is directly in front and moving away, MDC is effectively the lateral distance, which is 0.00m. However, this doesn't represent a collision risk due to the increasing longitudinal distance.  The obstacle's trajectory suggests no imminent collision.

Risk Assessment:
* Longitudinal Risk: No Risk (5) - The obstacle is moving away from the ego vehicle longitudinally.
* Lateral Risk: No Risk (5) - Although laterally aligned, the longitudinal movement negates lateral risk.
* Overall Risk: No Risk (5) - The obstacle poses no collision risk in the foreseeable future.


Collision Scenario Determination:

This is NOT a collision scenario. No obstacle exhibits a risk score of 0 (collision) or 1 (extreme risk).
