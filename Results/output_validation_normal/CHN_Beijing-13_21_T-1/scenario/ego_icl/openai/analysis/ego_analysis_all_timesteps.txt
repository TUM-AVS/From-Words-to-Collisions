### Obstacle-by-Obstacle Analysis:

#### Obstacle 3074:
- **Identification & Position:**
  - At the most recent timestep (0.9 seconds), Obstacle 3074 is located directly in front of the ego vehicle at an adjusted longitudinal distance of 15.10 meters and adjusted lateral distance of 0.00 meters. 
  - The obstacle's relative velocity is longitudinal 2.64 m/s and demonstrates that it is moving away from the ego vehicle. 

- **Trajectory Analysis:**
  - Across previous timesteps, the obstacle consistently increased its distance from the ego vehicle, confirming a steady movement away from the ego vehicle longitudinally.
  - Lateral alignment is exact (lateral distance = 0.00m), but no lateral movement is indicated (relative lateral velocity is 0.00 m/s).

- **Time-to-Collision (TTC) Calculation:**
  - Since the relative velocity indicates movement away from the vehicle, TTC is not practically applicable as collision paths are diverging.

- **Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC) Calculation:**
  - The MDC would primarily be the adjusted longitudinal distance (since exact lateral alignment with no lateral velocity is present), which is 15.10 meters.

- **Risk Assessment:**
  - **MDC Analysis:** An MDC of 15.10 meters corresponds to a "No Risk" level (5) as the distance is well beyond 5.0 meters and increasing.
  - **TTC Analysis:** Not applicable due to diverging paths.
  - Combining both analyses, the overall risk score is 5 ("No Risk").

### Conclusion on Collision Scenario:

In this scenario, Obstacle 3074 poses no risk of collision with the ego vehicle because it is moving away from the ego vehicle, as reflected in both the consistent increase in distance over time and the positive relative velocity. Therefore, there is no collision scenario.
