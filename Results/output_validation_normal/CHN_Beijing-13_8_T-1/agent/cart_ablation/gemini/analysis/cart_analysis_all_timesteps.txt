The ego vehicle and obstacle 3070 are in different lanelets (9 and 127 respectively). While the provided data doesn't give lanelet geometry, the Y-coordinates of both ego and obstacle are very close and remain close over the time steps, suggesting they are likely traveling in parallel lanes.

The X-coordinates show that the ego vehicle is initially ahead of the obstacle (502.8787 vs 473.0476 at t=0.1s).  The ego vehicle is decelerating more rapidly than the obstacle. However, the difference in X-coordinates remains significant throughout the provided timeframe and is even increasing, indicating a decreasing risk of collision.

Based on this information, there appears to be no immediate collision risk.  The risk level would be categorized as low (4) or negligible (5) depending on the actual lanelet geometries and road structure which are not available from the provided data.
