The ego vehicle (ID 3074) and the obstacle (ID 3070) are in different lanelets (9 and 127 respectively).  While their Y-coordinates are relatively close, their X-coordinates show a significant gap, with the ego vehicle consistently ahead of the obstacle. Both vehicles are decelerating.  The obstacle is moving much slower than the ego vehicle, and the distance between them appears to be increasing over the time steps provided.  Based on the given trajectory, a collision in the next few moments seems unlikely.
