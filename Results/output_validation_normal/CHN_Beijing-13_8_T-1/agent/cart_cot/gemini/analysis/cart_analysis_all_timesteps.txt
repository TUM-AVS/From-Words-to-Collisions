At t=0.9s, the ego vehicle is at (493.4866, 583.3859) with a velocity of 7.8593 and the obstacle (ID 3070) is at (469.8107, 582.3694) with a velocity of 3.1453.  Both are moving in roughly the same direction (similar orientation around -3.1 radians).

**Analysis:**

1. **Longitudinal TTC:** The ego vehicle is closing in on the obstacle at a relative speed of 7.8593 - 3.1453 = 4.714. The longitudinal distance between them is 493.4866 - 469.8107 = 23.6759. Therefore, the approximate longitudinal TTC is 23.6759 / 4.714 ≈ 5.02 seconds.

2. **Lateral TTC:** The lateral distance between the vehicles is very small: 583.3859 - 582.3694 = 1.0165. Considering the similar orientations and the fact that the vehicles are in different lanelets (9 and 127), we can infer that the lateral movement is minimal and doesn't pose an immediate threat. Even if there were some lateral movement, a lane change by the ego vehicle wouldn't be advisable due to the small longitudinal gap.

3. **MDC:** The minimum distance between the vehicles at t=0.9s is approximately sqrt((23.6759)^2 + (1.0165)^2) ≈ 23.7 meters.

4. **Prediction:** Extrapolating the current trends, the ego vehicle's speed is decreasing while the obstacle's speed is also decreasing, which indicates both vehicles might continue to slow down. 

5. **Risk Assessment:**  Although the TTC is around 5 seconds, the MDC is only around 23.7 meters with a closing speed of 4.714. Given the deceleration rates in previous timesteps, both continue decelerating. Because there is no obvious sign of imminent collision but a high probability of MDC further reducing in the next few seconds, the current risk would be classified as low. The ego vehicle should continue decelerating to further increase the TTC and avoid any potential collision.
