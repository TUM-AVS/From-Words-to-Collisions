At t=0.9s, the ego vehicle at (493.4866, 583.3859) is moving with a velocity of 7.86 m/s and decelerating at -2.18 m/s². The obstacle (ID 3070) is at (469.8107, 582.3694) with a velocity of 3.15 m/s and decelerating at -2.46 m/s².

The lateral distance between the ego and the obstacle is approximately 1 meter (using rough estimation since orientations are close and the y-coordinates are similar).  The longitudinal distance is approximately 23.68 meters. The relative velocity is 7.86 - 3.15 = 4.71 m/s.  A rough estimate of TTC is 23.68 / 4.71 ≈ 5 seconds.  Given the lateral distance, lanelet information (different lanelets suggest they are not on a collision course), and the fact that both are decelerating, the risk of collision is low.
