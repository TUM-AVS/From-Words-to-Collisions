Upon analyzing the provided scenario, the focus is on the latest timestamps, particularly at 0.9 seconds. Here is a detailed evaluation:

### Evaluation:

1. **Ego Vehicle Trajectory:**
   - **Position (0.9s):** (493.4866, 583.3859)
   - **Orientation:** -3.0961905658843567
   - **Velocity:** 7.8593 m/s
   - **Acceleration:** -2.1831 m/s²

2. **Obstacle Trajectory:**
   - **Position (0.9s):** (469.8107, 582.3694)
   - **Orientation:** -3.1
   - **Velocity:** 3.1453 m/s
   - **Acceleration:** -2.458 m/s²

3. **Relative Motion Analysis:**
   - **Longitudinal distance between Ego and Obstacle:** 
     - The Ego vehicle is ahead of the obstacle. 
     - Lateral distance to the obstacle is approximately 1.0165 meters.
   - **Relative longitudinal velocity:**
     - The Ego vehicle is moving faster than the obstacle.

4. **TTC (Time to Collision):**
   - Given that the Ego is ahead and moving away (faster velocity and no closing longitudinal distance), the TTC is not applicable in a classic sense since the collision is not immediate or probable with current trajectories.

5. **MDC (Minimum Distance to Collision):**
   - There's a significant lateral distance (~1.0165m) meaning low risk of collision considering both are on separate paths/lanelets.

### Risk Evaluation:
- **Ego vs. Obstacle:**
  - There is no immediate risk of collision. The obstacle is in a separate lanelet (127.0 vs 9.0 for Ego), further reducing risk factors.

### Conclusion:
Based on the velocity, spatial separation, and lanelets, there is no significant risk of collision in the immediate future; hence, the risk is negligible.
