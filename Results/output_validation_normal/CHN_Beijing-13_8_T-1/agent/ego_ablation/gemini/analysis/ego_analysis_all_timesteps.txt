At t=0.9s, obstacle 3070 is 19.19m directly in front of the ego vehicle and approaching at -4.71 m/s. While the closing velocity is significant, the current distance provides a reasonable time-to-collision (TTC) of roughly 4 seconds.  There is no lateral movement to be concerned about since the lateral velocity is minimal. While there is a relative deceleration observed in this latest timestep, more data is needed to assess if this is indicative of a braking maneuver by obstacle 3070 or a momentary fluctuation. Therefore, I classify this obstacle as a medium risk at this moment.
