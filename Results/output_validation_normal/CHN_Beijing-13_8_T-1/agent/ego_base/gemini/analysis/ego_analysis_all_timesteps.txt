At t=0.9s, obstacle 3070 is 19.19m in front of the ego vehicle and approaching at -4.71 m/s. While the closing rate is significant, it's not immediately alarming given the distance.  There is no lateral movement of concern.  A risk level of 2 (high risk) seems appropriate as it necessitates monitoring and potential action but doesn't indicate an imminent collision.
