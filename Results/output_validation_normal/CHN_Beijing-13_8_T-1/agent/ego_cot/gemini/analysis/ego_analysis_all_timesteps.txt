### Safety analysis for timestep 0.9s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:
- **Obstacle ID:** 3070
- **Distance Risk reason:** At 0.9 seconds, Obstacle 3070 is 19.19m in front of the ego vehicle, both longitudinally and laterally. While this distance might seem safe initially, the continuous approach of the obstacle towards the ego vehicle over the observed time steps warrants closer inspection. The consistent reduction in longitudinal distance suggests a potential collision risk if the current trajectories remain unchanged. Although there’s significant lateral separation, the "Exact lateral alignment or unknown case" detail introduces uncertainty about the true lateral motion and thus the potential for lateral collision risk cannot be completely ruled out.
- **Distance safety score:** 3 (Medium Risk)
- **Time Risk reason:**  While the provided data doesn't directly give TTC, we can estimate it using the current relative velocity and distance.  The longitudinal relative velocity at 0.9s is -4.71 m/s (approaching).  A simple TTC estimate is 19.19m / 4.71 m/s ≈ 4.1 seconds. However, this is a simplified estimate and doesn't account for the changing acceleration. Although about 4 seconds seems like a reasonable time, the continued approach and uncertain lateral movement increase the time-based risk. 
- **Time safety score:** 3 (Medium Risk)
- **Overall Risk score:** 3 (Medium Risk)
