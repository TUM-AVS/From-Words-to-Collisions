### Analysis for Obstacle 3070 (Most Recent Timestep: 0.9 seconds)

#### Trajectory Analysis:
- **Longitudinal Distance (adjusted):** 19.19 m (decreasing from 24.15 m over 0.9 seconds)
- **Lateral Distance (adjusted):** 0.00 m (stable)
- **Relative Velocity (longitudinal):** -4.71 m/s (approaching)
- **Relative Velocity (lateral):** -0.01 m/s (negligible)
- **Motion Description:** Obstacle is driving toward the ego car longitudinally with exact lateral alignment.

#### Calculations:
1. **Time-to-Collision (TTC):**
   - Longitudinal TTC = Distance / |Relative Velocity| = 19.19 m / 4.71 m/s â‰ˆ 4.07 seconds
   - Lateral TTC: Not applicable (lateral distance stable, no closing velocity)

2. **Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC):**
   - Since the obstacle is directly in front (lateral = 0.00 m), MDC is the longitudinal distance: 19.19 m.

#### Risk Assessment:
- **TTC (4.07 seconds):** Low Risk (4)
- **MDC (19.19 m):** No Risk (5)
- **Overall Risk:** Low Risk (4) - Prioritize the lower score (higher risk) between TTC and MDC.

#### Reasoning:
- The obstacle is directly ahead but at a significant distance (19.19 m).
- The closing speed is moderate (4.71 m/s), resulting in a TTC of ~4.07 seconds.
- No immediate collision risk, but the ego vehicle should monitor the situation as the obstacle is approaching.
