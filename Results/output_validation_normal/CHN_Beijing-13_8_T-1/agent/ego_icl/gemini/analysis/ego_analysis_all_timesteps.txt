Obstacle 3070 is in front of the ego vehicle and has been consistently aligned laterally (0.00m lateral distance) across all timesteps. The longitudinal distance has been decreasing steadily, indicating the obstacle is approaching the ego vehicle.

At the most recent timestep (0.9 seconds), the longitudinal distance is 19.19m and the lateral distance is 0.00m. The relative longitudinal velocity is -4.71 m/s (approaching).  Since the lateral distance is zero, MDC is based on the longitudinal distance of 19.19m.

TTC Calculation (longitudinal):
TTC = Distance / |Relative Velocity| = 19.19m / |-4.71 m/s| = 4.07s

Risk Assessment:
* MDC: 19.19m > 5.0m indicates Negligible Risk (5)
* TTC: 4.07s suggests Low Risk (4)

Since we prioritize the higher risk (lower score), the overall risk for Obstacle 3070 is Low Risk (4).
