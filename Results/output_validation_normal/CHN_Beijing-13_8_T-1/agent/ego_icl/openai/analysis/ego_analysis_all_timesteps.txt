### Obstacle Analysis: Obstacle 3070

**Trajectory Analysis:**
- **Timestep 0.0 to 0.9 seconds**: Obstacle 3070 is consistently in front of the ego vehicle with a decreasing longitudinal distance, indicating it is closing in.
- **Movement Description**: Always mentioned as "driving toward the ego car longitudinally" with exact lateral alignment (0.00m), meaning it is in the same lane.

**Most Recent Timestep (0.9 seconds):**
- **Adjusted Longitudinal Distance**: 19.19 meters
- **Adjusted Lateral Distance**: 0.00 meters (aligned).
- **Relative Velocity (longitudinal)**: -4.71 m/s (approaching)
- **Motion**: The obstacle is still moving toward the ego vehicle longitudinally.
  
**Time-to-Collision (TTC) Calculation:**
- In the longitudinal direction: 
  \( \text{TTC}_{\text{longitudinal}} = \frac{19.19 \text{ m}}{4.71 \text{ m/s}} \approx 4.07 \text{ seconds} \)

- The lateral TTC doesn’t primarily impact this because there's no lateral component contributing to risk in the current alignment.

**Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC) Calculation:**
- Since the lateral distance is expected to maintain alignment, focus on the longitudinal will suffice.
- From trajectory data: This distance is not expected to significantly lessen immediately.

**Risk Level Evaluation:**
1. **MDC**: Greater than 5.0 meters, indicating no immediate collision risk.
2. **TTC**: About 4.07 seconds, indicating low risk (TTC < 5.0 seconds).
3. **Summary**: The obstacle is moving toward the ego but at a manageable closing rate considering that acceleration isn't showing significant negative trends or surprises.

**Overall Risk Assessment:**
- Obstacle 3070 remains on low risk, categorized as “Minimal risk, sufficient time to react.”
