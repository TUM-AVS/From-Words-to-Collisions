At t=0.9s, the ego vehicle is at (493.49, 583.39) and the obstacle (ID 3070) is at (469.81, 582.37).  The distance between them is approximately 23.7 meters. While the obstacle is decelerating and the ego vehicle is also decelerating more rapidly, the current trajectories suggest a possible collision in the near future if these trends continue.  Further projection of the trajectories is needed to assess with certainty, but the current proximity and closing speeds warrant an "Extreme Risk" classification.

  "ScenarioAnalysis": {
    "IsCollisionScenario": false,
    "Reasoning": "Obstacle 3070.0 poses an extreme risk due to close proximity and closing speed with the ego vehicle. While not an immediate collision, the current trajectories suggest a high probability of collision if the trends continue."
