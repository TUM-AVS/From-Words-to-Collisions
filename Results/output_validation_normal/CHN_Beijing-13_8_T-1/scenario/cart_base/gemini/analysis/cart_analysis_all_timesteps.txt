At t=0.9s, the ego vehicle is at (493.4866, 583.3859) and the obstacle is at (469.8107, 582.3694).  The vehicles are in different lanelets and the distance between them is approximately 24 meters. While the ego vehicle is decelerating, the lateral separation suggests there is no immediate collision risk.  Observing the trajectories from previous timesteps confirms that the vehicles are not on a direct collision course.
