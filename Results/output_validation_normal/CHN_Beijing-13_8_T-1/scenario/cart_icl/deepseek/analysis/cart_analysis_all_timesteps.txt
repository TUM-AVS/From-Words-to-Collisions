### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep (0.9 seconds):

### Obstacle Analysis:
- **Obstacle ID**: 3070.0  
  - **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is in a different lanelet (127.0) than the ego vehicle (9.0). The lateral distance is significant, and the obstacle is moving away from the ego vehicle's trajectory.  
  - **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)  
  - **Time Risk reason**: The obstacle is decelerating (velocity decreasing from 5.1165 to 3.1453 m/s) and moving away from the ego vehicle. The relative velocity is not converging.  
  - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)  
  - **Overall Risk score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)  

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. **Lanelet Check**: Ego is in lanelet 9.0, obstacle is in lanelet 127.0 (no overlap).  
2. **Trajectory Analysis**: Obstacle is moving away from ego's path (Y-coordinate difference is stable ~1.0m).  
3. **Velocity/Acceleration**: Obstacle is decelerating faster than ego, increasing separation.  
4. **Collision Risk**: No intersection or convergence in trajectories.
