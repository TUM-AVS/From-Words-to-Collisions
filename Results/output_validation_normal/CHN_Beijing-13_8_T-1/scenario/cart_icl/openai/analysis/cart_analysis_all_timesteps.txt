   - **Time Risk Reason**: Low velocity, not converging on the ego vehicle's path.
   - **Time Safety Score**: 4
   - **Overall Risk Score**: 4

7. **Obstacle ID: 3058**
   - **Distance Risk Reason**: Initial proximity but moving slowly with a decreasing velocity; not encroaching.
   - **Distance Safety Score**: 4
   - **Time Risk Reason**: Consistent deceleration indicating reduced threat.
   - **Time Safety Score**: 4
   - **Overall Risk Score**: 4

8. **Obstacle ID: 3059**
   - **Distance Risk Reason**: Following a separate trajectory with no risk of collision so far.
   - **Distance Safety Score**: 5
   - **Time Risk Reason**: Consistent minor speeds and direction away from ego path.
   - **Time Safety Score**: 5
   - **Overall Risk Score**: 5

9. **Obstacle ID: 3060**
   - **Distance Risk Reason**: Slightly moving directionally away; no overlap with ego vehicle's path trajectory noted.
   - **Distance Safety Score**: 5
   - **Time Risk Reason**: Safe velocities away from the path; accelerating further.
   - **Time Safety Score**: 5
   - **Overall Risk Score**: 5

10. **Obstacle ID: 3070**
    - **Distance Risk Reason**: This obstacle, although in a nearby lanelet, has slowed down, indicating behavior not aimed at crossing the ego's trajectory.
    - **Distance Safety Score**: 4
    - **Time Risk Reason**: Diminished speed showing lower dynamics affecting the ego.
    - **Time Safety Score**: 4
    - **Overall Risk Score**: 4

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
- Upon reviewing the entire scenario history for the given obstacles, none pose an immediate collision threat to the ego vehicle.
- **Conclusion**: Given the trajectories, velocities, and maintaining directions of these obstacles, there's no significant risk of collision, confirming no collision scenario present.
