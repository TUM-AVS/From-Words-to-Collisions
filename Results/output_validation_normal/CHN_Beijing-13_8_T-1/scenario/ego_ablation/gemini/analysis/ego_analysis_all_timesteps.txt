Obstacle 3070 is approaching the ego vehicle head-on.  While the current distance is 19.19 meters, the closing velocity is -4.71 m/s.  Although it's not an immediate collision, the persistent negative relative velocity and fluctuating acceleration warrants attention. More information about the ego vehicle's planned trajectory and braking capabilities are needed for a complete risk assessment.  However, given the direct approach and closing velocity, a high risk is present.
