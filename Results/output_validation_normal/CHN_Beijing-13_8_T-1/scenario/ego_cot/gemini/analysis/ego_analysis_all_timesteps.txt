### Safety analysis for timestep 0.9 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 3070
- Distance Risk reason: At 0.9 seconds, Obstacle 3070 is 19.19m in front of the ego vehicle, both longitudinally and laterally.  While this distance isn't immediately dangerous, the consistent approach of the obstacle over the observed time period suggests a potential collision risk if the current trajectories continue. The lateral position indicates it is directly ahead of the ego vehicle, raising concerns.
- Distance safety score: 3 (Medium Risk)
- Time Risk reason:  To accurately assess TTC, we need the ego vehicle's velocity. Assuming constant relative velocity as observed in the last few timesteps (around -4.71 m/s longitudinally), a rough estimate for TTC is 19.19m / 4.71 m/s â‰ˆ 4.1 seconds. However, relative acceleration has fluctuated, making a precise TTC calculation challenging. 4.1 seconds suggests a medium-term collision risk if no evasive action is taken. Lateral movement is negligible (-0.01 m/s), so lateral TTC is very high, implying no immediate lateral collision risk.
- Time safety score: 3 (Medium Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 3 (Medium Risk)


### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
  "CollisionObstacle": null,
  "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null,
  "IsCollisionScenario": false,
  "Justification": "While Obstacle 3070 is approaching the ego vehicle, the current TTC of approximately 4.1 seconds and MDC of 19.19m suggest a medium-term risk rather than an immediate collision. The situation requires monitoring and potential evasive maneuvers, but it is not yet a collision scenario."
