Obstacle 3070 Analysis:

Trajectory Analysis: Obstacle 3070 is consistently in front of the ego vehicle and approaching along the longitudinal axis.  The lateral distance remains at 0.00m throughout all timesteps, indicating perfect lateral alignment. The longitudinal distance decreases steadily over time, suggesting a potential collision if the trend continues.

At t=0.9s:

- Longitudinal distance: 19.19m
- Lateral distance: 0.00m
- Longitudinal relative velocity: -4.71 m/s (approaching)
- Lateral relative velocity: -0.01 m/s

TTC Calculation:
- Longitudinal TTC = 19.19m / 4.71 m/s â‰ˆ 4.07 seconds

MDC Calculation:
Given the obstacle is directly in front of the ego vehicle, the MDC is primarily determined by the consistently zero lateral distance and closing longitudinal distance. Therefore, MDC is effectively the longitudinal distance at the last time step, which is 19.19m. This value is not used for final risk score in this case.

Risk Assessment:
- Longitudinal Risk: Based on TTC (4.07s), the longitudinal risk is Low (4).

Overall Risk: The overall risk for Obstacle 3070 is Low (4).

Collision Scenario Determination:

This is NOT a collision scenario. No obstacle has a risk score of 0 (Collision) or 1 (Extreme Risk).
