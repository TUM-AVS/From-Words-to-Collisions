### Obstacle Analysis

#### Obstacle ID: 3070
- **Trajectory Analysis Across Timesteps:**
  - At 0.1 seconds: Longitudinal distance = 24.15m, velocity = -6.50 m/s
  - At 0.2 seconds: Longitudinal distance = 23.46m, velocity = -6.21 m/s
  - At 0.3 seconds: Longitudinal distance = 22.79m, velocity = -6.15 m/s
  - At 0.4 seconds: Longitudinal distance = 22.14m, velocity = -5.96 m/s
  - At 0.5 seconds: Longitudinal distance = 21.50m, velocity = -5.69 m/s
  - At 0.6 seconds: Longitudinal distance = 20.89m, velocity = -5.52 m/s
  - At 0.7 seconds: Longitudinal distance = 20.30m, velocity = -5.29 m/s
  - At 0.8 seconds: Longitudinal distance = 19.73m, velocity = -4.85 m/s
  - **At 0.9 seconds**: Longitudinal distance = 19.19m, velocity = -4.71 m/s
  
- **TTC Calculation for Most Recent Timestep (0.9 seconds):**
  - **Longitudinal TTC** = 19.19m / 4.71 m/s â‰ˆ 4.07 seconds
  - **Lateral TTC** = Not significant given lateral distance and velocity (obstacle is aligned)

- **MDC Calculation:**
  - **Longitudinal MDC** = Not relevant due to alignment
  - **Lateral MDC** = Assumed to be minimal (0.00m alignment). Trailing distances imply negligible lateral component. Default safe MDT in such alignment scenarios.

- **Risk Assessment Current Timestep (0.9 seconds)**:
  - **Longitudinal Risk:** TTC < 5.0s but > 3.0s, thus representing **Low Risk (4)**
  - **Lateral Assessment:** Negligible impact due to alignment, but remains **Low Risk (4)** due to trajectory trend.

Despite exact alignment, the obstacle's deceleration is minor; the longitudinal gap is reducing but not critically fast. However, given the overall trajectory noted above and alignment scenarios, this is not typically escalatory without external situational changes (e.g., future acceleration of ego vehicle).

### Conclusion
No collision or extreme risk is evident at this timestep based on all factors aligning with given trajectories. Both TTC and MDC affirm a low risk.
