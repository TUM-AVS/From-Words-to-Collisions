Obstacle 3049 is in the same lane as the Ego vehicle and is moving slightly faster.  The initial distance between them is about 14 meters. Over the course of the provided timesteps, the distance between the two is decreasing, indicating a potential for collision if the Ego vehicle continues to decelerate and Obstacle 3049 maintains its speed or accelerates. While a collision isn't imminent in the next second, the closing distance and speed differential warrants attention. It presents a high risk.

Obstacles 3046 and 3047 are initially in different lanelets than the Ego vehicle. Though their trajectories seem to be moving somewhat closer to the Ego vehicle's lanelet, they don't pose an immediate collision risk within the observed timeframe.

Obstacle 3051, while initially far away and in a different lanelet, is travelling at a high speed (40 m/s).  Its trajectory over the subsequent timesteps seems to be approaching the area where the Ego vehicle is located.  However, given the current positions and orientations, it doesn't pose an immediate collision risk.
