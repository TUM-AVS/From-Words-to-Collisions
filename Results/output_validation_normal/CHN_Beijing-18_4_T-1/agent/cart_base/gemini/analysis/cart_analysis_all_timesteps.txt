Obstacle 3049 is in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle and is moving slightly faster.  The longitudinal distance between them is decreasing over time. While not immediately colliding, the closing speed suggests a high risk of collision if the behavior of either vehicle doesn't change.

Obstacle 3046 and 3047 initially appear somewhat far from the ego vehicle. However, their trajectories and lane changes seem to bring them closer to the ego vehicle's lanelet. Further observation is needed to definitively classify their risk.

Obstacle 3051 has a high velocity and is approaching from a different lanelet. While not a collision risk in the immediate future, its high speed means it could pose a risk later depending on its trajectory.
