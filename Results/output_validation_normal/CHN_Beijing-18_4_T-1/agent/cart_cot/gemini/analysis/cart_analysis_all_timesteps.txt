At t=0.9s, the ego vehicle (ID 3048) is at (618.6331, 656.2692) with a velocity of 2.8346 and acceleration of -1.602.  Let's analyze the risk posed by each obstacle at this timestep:

* **Obstacle 3046:** Position (629.279, 661.0966), velocity 7.1068, acceleration 0.2516. This obstacle is located in a different lanelet (314) than the ego vehicle (84) and poses no immediate threat.  While the Y positions are relatively close, the X positions suggest a safe lateral distance. The difference in X coordinates is around 10.6, considering the current velocities and moderate acceleration.

* **Obstacle 3047:** Position (632.9242, 651.6722), velocity 6.5566, acceleration 1.4997. This obstacle is also in a different lanelet (312). While the Y coordinates show a larger difference than Obstacle 3046, the X difference (approximately 14.3) combined with the lane difference, implies no imminent collision risk.

* **Obstacle 3049:** Position (605.5803, 655.9008), velocity 7.182, acceleration -3.702.  This obstacle is in the same lanelet (84) as the ego vehicle. The X difference of approximately -13.0528, suggests that this obstacle is behind the ego vehicle and the negative acceleration makes the threat less imminent.

* **Obstacle 3051:** Position (636.4993, 668.7215), velocity 40.7459, acceleration 0.5123.  This obstacle is in a different lanelet (18) and significantly farther in the Y direction.  The high velocity is a potential concern, but its current position and lane make a collision highly unlikely in the immediate future.

**TTC and MDC Calculations (t=0.9s)**

Precise TTC calculations require more information about vehicle shapes and orientations. However, given the data, we can approximate TTC using simple distance and velocity differences, assuming constant velocity and acceleration.

Since we're primarily concerned with the most imminent risks, we will look at the time-to-collision with obstacle 3049.  The distance is approximately 13.05 and closing at a speed of 7.182 - 2.8346 = 4.3474. This gives us TTC ≈ 13.05/ 4.3474 ≈ 3 seconds. The accelerations could increase or decrease this time.  Obstacle 3049 poses a potential risk due to the same lane occupancy, negative acceleration for the ego vehicle and positive acceleration for the obstacle. However, at the given moment there is not an extreme risk.

MDC would simply be the Euclidean distance calculation at time t=0.9s between the ego vehicle and its nearest neighbors. Based on provided data, Obstacle 3049 is the nearest obstacle to the ego vehicle.
