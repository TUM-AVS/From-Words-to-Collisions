At t=0.9s, the ego vehicle (ID 3048) is at (618.6331, 656.2692) with a velocity of 2.8346 m/s and acceleration of -1.602 m/sÂ². Let's analyze the risk posed by each obstacle:

* **Obstacle 3046:** Located at (629.279, 661.0966), this obstacle is in a different lanelet and poses no immediate risk.  Its motion suggests it's moving away from the ego vehicle's path. Risk: **Negligible (5)**

* **Obstacle 3047:**  At (632.9242, 651.6722), also in a different lanelet. Although laterally closer to the ego vehicle than 3046, the trajectories don't indicate a high risk of collision. Risk: **Negligible (5)**

* **Obstacle 3049:** Located at (605.5803, 655.9008) in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle. This obstacle is behind the ego vehicle and moving slower.  It poses no immediate risk. Risk: **Negligible (5)**

* **Obstacle 3051:**  Position (636.4993, 668.7215). This obstacle is in a different lanelet and far from the ego vehicle. Risk: **Negligible (5)**
