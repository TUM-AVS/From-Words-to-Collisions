To analyze the given scenario, let's evaluate the relative positions and velocities of the Ego vehicle and the identified obstacles at the latest timestep (0.9 seconds). Here is the quick analysis based on the position, orientation, velocity, and acceleration of each entity:

### Analysis of Each Obstacle at 0.9 Seconds:

1. **Obstacle 3046 (ID = 3046.0):**
   - **Position:** (629.279, 661.0966)
   - **Velocity:** 7.1068 m/s
   - **Ego's Relative Position and Speed:**
     - Ego (618.6331, 656.2692)
     - **Longitudinal Offset (X):** 629.279 - 618.6331 = 10.6459 m
     - **Lateral Offset (Y):** 661.0966 - 656.2692 = 4.8274 m
   - Not in the same lanelet and with a significant lateral offset, thus poses **no immediate collision risk.**

2. **Obstacle 3047 (ID = 3047.0):**
   - **Position:** (632.9242, 651.6722)
   - **Velocity:** 6.5566 m/s
   - **Ego's Relative Position and Speed:**
     - **Longitudinal Offset (X):** 632.9242 - 618.6331 = 14.2911 m
     - **Lateral Offset (Y):** 651.6722 - 656.2692 = -4.597 m
   - In a different lanelet, and moving further away, thus poses **minimal risk.**

3. **Obstacle 3049 (ID = 3049.0):**
   - **Position:** (605.5803, 655.9008)
   - **Velocity:** 7.182 m/s
   - **Ego's Relative Position and Speed:**
     - **Longitudinal Offset (X):** 618.6331 - 605.5803 = 13.0528 m (Ego in front)
     - **Lateral Offset (Y):** 656.2692 - 655.9008 = 0.3684 m
   - Same lanelet and with a very short lateral distance, obstacle closing in.
   - **TTC ~ (13.0528 / (7.182 - 2.8346)) = 2.88 seconds** indicates high risk scenario.

4. **Obstacle 3051 (ID = 3051.0):**
   - **Position:** (636.4993, 668.7215)
   - **Velocity:** 40.7459 m/s
   - **Ego's Relative Position and Speed:**
     - **Longitudinal Offset (X):** 636.4993 - 618.6331 = 17.8662 m
     - **Lateral Offset (Y):** 668.7215 - 656.2692 = 12.4523 m
   - High speed, but different lanelet and far lateral distance; presents **no risk**.

### Risky Obstacle Explanation for Obstacle 3049:
- **Obstacle 3049** is in the same lanelet as the Ego vehicle and is closing rapidly with a small lateral distance, its position directly behind the Ego vehicle posing a significant risk of collision, particularly since it is accelerating while the Ego vehicle is decelerating.
