At t=0.9s, obstacle 3046 is closing in longitudinally (-9.31 m/s) and laterally (-2.93 m/s) with a distance of 6.27m longitudinally and 2.91m laterally. This represents a very high risk, potentially an "Extreme Risk" due to the short distance and closing velocities.

Obstacle 3047 maintains a safe lateral distance and does not pose an immediate threat.

Obstacle 3049, while approaching from behind, is still at a safe distance longitudinally.  It requires monitoring but is not an immediate risk.

Obstacle 3051 is also moving laterally away from the ego vehicle and does not pose a risk.

Therefore, Obstacle 3046 is considered to be at Extreme Risk.
