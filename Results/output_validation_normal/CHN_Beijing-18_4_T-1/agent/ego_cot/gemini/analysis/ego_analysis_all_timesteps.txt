### Safety analysis for timestep 0.9s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

**- Obstacle ID: 3046**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is in the front-left and relatively close (6.27m longitudinal and lateral) and moving towards the ego vehicle.
- Distance safety score: 2 (High Risk)
- Time Risk reason:  The continuous decrease in distance suggests a possible collision if the current trajectories are maintained.  Without specific velocity and acceleration values, a precise TTC cannot be calculated, but the trend indicates a short time to collision.
- Time safety score: 2 (High Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 2 (High Risk)

**- Obstacle ID: 3047**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is in the front-right at 9.64m (longitudinal and lateral) and moving slightly closer longitudinally but further away laterally.
- Distance safety score: 3 (Medium Risk)
- Time Risk reason: While longitudinally approaching slowly, the lateral movement away from the ego vehicle mitigates the risk.  A precise TTC calculation is not possible without velocity/acceleration data, but risk appears moderate.
- Time safety score: 3 (Medium Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 3 (Medium Risk)


**- Obstacle ID: 3049**
- Distance Risk reason: Located behind the ego vehicle at -8.55m (longitudinal and lateral) and closing the distance. 
- Distance safety score: 3 (Medium Risk)
- Time Risk reason: While approaching from behind, the rate of closure needs to be carefully considered. The provided data doesn't allow for precise TTC calculation, but the trend warrants attention.
- Time safety score: 3 (Medium Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 3 (Medium Risk)

**- Obstacle ID: 3051**
- Distance Risk reason: Situated in the front-left at a substantial distance (13.71m longitudinal and lateral) and moving further away laterally.
- Distance safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
- Time Risk reason: Although longitudinally approaching, the significant lateral distance and movement away reduce the collision risk.  TTC cannot be calculated without more data, but the scenario appears low risk.
- Time safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 4 (Low Risk)
