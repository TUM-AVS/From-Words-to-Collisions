Let me analyze each obstacle at the most recent timestep (0.9 seconds) with trajectory context:

1. Obstacle 3046 (Front-left):
- Current position: longitudinal 6.27m, lateral 2.91m
- Relative velocity: longitudinal -9.31 m/s (approaching), lateral -2.93 m/s (approaching)
- Trajectory: Consistently approaching from front-left with high closing speeds
- TTC_long = 6.27/9.31 = 0.67s
- TTC_lat = 2.91/2.93 = 0.99s
- MDC: Both distances decreasing, minimum projected distance is ~2.91m (lateral)
- Risk: High (TTC_long < 1s, lateral distance closing)

2. Obstacle 3047 (Front-right):
- Current position: longitudinal 9.64m, lateral -3.40m
- Relative velocity: longitudinal -1.20 m/s (approaching), lateral -6.35 m/s (moving away)
- Trajectory: Slowly approaching longitudinally but moving away laterally
- TTC_long = 9.64/1.20 = 8.03s (not concerning)
- MDC: Lateral distance increasing, minimal collision risk
- Risk: Low (MDC > 5m, diverging paths)

3. Obstacle 3049 (Behind):
- Current position: longitudinal -8.55m, lateral 0.00m
- Relative velocity: longitudinal 4.35 m/s (approaching from rear), lateral 0.00 m/s
- Trajectory: Consistently approaching from rear but at moderate speed
- TTC_long = 8.55/4.35 = 1.97s
- MDC: Only longitudinal concern, distance > 5m
- Risk: Medium (TTC between 1-3s)

4. Obstacle 3051 (Front-left):
- Current position: longitudinal 13.71m, lateral 10.32m
- Relative velocity: longitudinal -2.96 m/s (approaching), lateral 40.75 m/s (moving away)
- Trajectory: Slowly approaching longitudinally but rapidly moving away laterally
- TTC_long = 13.71/2.96 = 4.63s
- MDC: Lateral distance increasing rapidly, minimal risk
- Risk: Low (MDC > 5m, diverging paths)

Most critical risks:
- Obstacle 3046 presents High Risk (Score 2)
- Obstacle 3049 presents Medium Risk (Score 3)
- No Collision (Score 0) or Extreme Risk (Score 1) detected
