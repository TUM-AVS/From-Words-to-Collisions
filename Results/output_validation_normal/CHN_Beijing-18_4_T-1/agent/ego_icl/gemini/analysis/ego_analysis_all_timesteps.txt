* **Obstacle 3046 (Front-Left):**

    * Trajectory: This obstacle has been consistently approaching the ego vehicle both longitudinally and laterally across all timesteps.  At the last timestep (0.9s), it is at 6.27m longitudinally and 2.91m laterally. The relative longitudinal velocity is -9.31 m/s and lateral velocity is -2.93 m/s (both closing).

    * TTC: Longitudinal TTC = 6.27m / 9.31m/s ≈ 0.67s. Lateral TTC = 2.91m / 2.93m/s ≈ 0.99s.

    * MDC: Given the diagonal approach, the MDC is difficult to calculate precisely without more information on the exact trajectories. However, considering the proximity (both longitudinal and lateral distances under 7 meters and decreasing) and the short TTCs, the MDC will likely be quite low.

    * Risk Assessment: The low TTC values (< 1s) indicate an *Extreme Risk (1)*.


* **Obstacle 3047 (Front-Right):**

    * Trajectory: While maintaining a relatively stable longitudinal distance around 10 meters, this obstacle has been moving away laterally from the ego vehicle. At 0.9s, the distance is 9.64m longitudinally and -3.40m laterally.

    * TTC: Longitudinal TTC = 9.64m / 1.20m/s ≈ 8.03s.  Lateral TTC is not relevant as the obstacle is moving away laterally.

    * MDC: With the obstacle moving away laterally, the MDC is primarily determined by the longitudinal distance, which is significant.

    * Risk Assessment: Despite the relatively stable longitudinal distance, the obstacle is still slightly closing longitudinally. Given the 8.03s TTC and the increasing lateral separation, the risk is *Low (4)*.


* **Obstacle 3049 (Behind):**

    * Trajectory: This obstacle is directly behind the ego vehicle (lateral distance 0.00m) and has been closing in across all timesteps. At 0.9s, the longitudinal distance is -8.55m.

    * TTC: Longitudinal TTC = 8.55m / 4.35m/s ≈ 1.97s.

    * MDC: The primary concern is the closing longitudinal distance.

    * Risk Assessment: Based on the TTC, the risk is assessed as *Medium (3)*.


* **Obstacle 3051 (Front-Left):**

    * Trajectory:  This obstacle has been moving laterally left, while slowly approaching longitudinally. At the final timestep, it is positioned at 13.71m longitudinal and 10.32m lateral distances.

    * TTC: Longitudinal TTC = 13.71m / 2.96m/s ≈ 4.63s. Lateral TTC is not relevant since the obstacle is moving away from ego.

    * MDC: Considering the lateral movement away from the ego vehicle, the MDC is primarily determined by the longitudinal distance.

    * Risk Assessment: With a TTC > 3s and the lateral distance increasing, this obstacle poses a *Low Risk (4)*.
