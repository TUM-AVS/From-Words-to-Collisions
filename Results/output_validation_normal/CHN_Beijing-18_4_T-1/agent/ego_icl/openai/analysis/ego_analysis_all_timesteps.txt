To effectively assess the collision risk associated with each obstacle, we must thoroughly evaluate the position changes, relative velocities, and trajectories of each obstacle at the most recent timestamp (0.9 seconds) and then derive the Time-to-Collision (TTC) and Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC). These key metrics will then determine our risk levels.

### Analysis for each obstacle at 0.9 seconds:

#### Obstacle 3046:
- **Position**: Front-left of the ego vehicle.
- **Adjusted longitudinal distance**: 6.27m; **Adjusted lateral distance**: 2.91m.
- **Relative velocity**: longitudinal -9.31 m/s, lateral -2.93 m/s.
- **Trajectory Analysis**: Rapidly closing in both dimensions.
- **TTC Calculation**: 
  - Longitudinal: |6.27 / -9.31| ≈ 0.67 seconds (High risk)
  - Lateral: |2.91 / -2.93| ≈ 0.99 seconds (High risk)
- **MDC Calculation**: Projected crossing path suggesting both dimensions reaching close proximity simultaneously.
- **Risk Assessment**: Both TTC and MDC suggest a high risk due to converging trajectories in both dimensions.

#### Obstacle 3047:
- **Position**: Front-right of the ego vehicle.
- **Adjusted longitudinal distance**: 9.64m; **Adjusted lateral distance**: -3.40m.
- **Relative velocity**: longitudinal -1.20 m/s, lateral -6.35 m/s.
- **Trajectory Analysis**: Primarily moving laterally away.
- **TTC Calculation**: 
  - Longitudinal: |9.64 / -1.20| ≈ 8.03 seconds (No risk)
  - Lateral: |-3.40 / -6.35| ≈ 0.54 seconds (Extreme risk)
- **MDC Calculation**: Lateral distance decreasing rapidly despite being longitudinally stable.
- **Risk Assessment**: Gray zone with extreme lateral convergence while maintaining longitudinal stability.

#### Obstacle 3049:
- **Position**: Behind the ego vehicle.
- **Adjusted longitudinal distance**: -8.55m; **Adjusted lateral distance**: 0.00m (aligned).
- **Relative velocity**: longitudinal 4.35 m/s (closing).
- **Trajectory Analysis**: Slight longitudinal approach, no lateral change.
- **TTC Calculation**: 
  - Longitudinal: |-8.55 / 4.35| ≈ 1.97 seconds (Medium risk)
  - Lateral: Not applicable (no lateral approach).
- **MDC Calculation**: Minor longitudinal risk due to closing speed.
- **Risk Assessment**: Continuous longitudinal closure suggests medium risk.

#### Obstacle 3051:
- **Position**: Front-left of the ego vehicle.
- **Adjusted longitudinal distance**: 13.71m; **Adjusted lateral distance**: 10.32m.
- **Relative velocity**: longitudinal -2.96 m/s, lateral 40.75 m/s.
- **Trajectory Analysis**: Lateral motion is away, longitudinally closing very slowly.
- **TTC Calculation**: 
  - Longitudinal: |13.71 / -2.96| ≈ 4.63 seconds (Low risk)
- **MDC Calculation**: Suggests adequate distance before paths potentially intersect.
- **Risk Assessment**: Low longitudinal risk due to diminishing lateral interaction and slow longitudinal closure.

In summary:
- **Obstacle 3047** poses an extreme lateral risk due to a very low TTC on the right side.
- **Obstacle 3046** is of high concern due to rapid closure from the front-left on both axes.
- **Obstacle 3049** remains a medium risk coming from directly behind.
- **Obstacle 3051** is low risk due to slow closure, and significant lateral movement away suggests less imminent risk.
