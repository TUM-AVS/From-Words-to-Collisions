At t=0.9s, Ego (3048) is in lanelet 84. Let's analyze the obstacles:

* **Obstacle 3049:**  Also in lanelet 84, relatively close to Ego and moving faster (8.17 m/s at t=0.4s vs Ego's ~2.83 m/s), posing a rear-end collision risk if Ego decelerates further. While not immediately colliding, the speed difference and proximity warrant attention, placing it in at least a High-Risk category (2 or lower), potentially Extreme (1) depending on deceleration rates.

* **Obstacle 3047:** In lanelet 312.  Trajectory shows movement towards lanelets intersecting lanelet 84. Current information doesn't suggest immediate collision, but further trajectory prediction is needed to assess if its path intersects with Ego's with dangerous proximity.  For now, considering it Medium risk or lower (3+).

* **Obstacle 3046:** In lanelet 314,  no immediate risk.

* **Obstacle 3051:**  In lanelet 18. No immediate risk given its distance and different lanelet.


Since obstacle 3049 poses the most significant risk at this timestep (t=0.9s) and is rapidly approaching Ego from behind, a risk score of 1 (Extreme Risk) is assigned.

  },
  "ScenarioAnalysis": {
    "IsCollisionScenario": false,
    "Reasoning": "Obstacle 3049 poses an extreme risk due to its proximity, higher speed in the same lane (84), and closing velocity with Ego.  While not an immediate collision at t=0.9s, it is very likely without intervention."
