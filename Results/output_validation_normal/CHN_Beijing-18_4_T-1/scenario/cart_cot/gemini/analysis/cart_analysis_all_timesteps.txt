### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 3046.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 3046.0 is in a different lanelet (314.0) than the ego vehicle (84.0) at the last timestep, and its trajectory over the past timesteps shows it moving further away laterally.  While initially closer, the lateral separation has been increasing.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: The obstacle's velocity and acceleration do not present an immediate time-related collision risk given its lateral movement away from the ego vehicle's lane.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 3047.0
- Distance Risk reason: Similar to obstacle 3046.0, obstacle 3047.0 is in a different lanelet (312.0) and its trajectory indicates increasing lateral separation from the ego vehicle.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: The obstacle's velocity and acceleration, combined with its lateral movement away from the ego vehicle, pose no immediate time-related collision risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 3049.0
- Distance Risk reason:  This obstacle is in the same lanelet (84.0) as the ego vehicle. While it is behind the ego vehicle, its velocity is consistently higher than the ego vehicle's velocity, indicating a potential for a rear-end collision if the ego vehicle continues to decelerate at a faster rate.  The distance between them is decreasing over time.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: The closing velocity between the ego vehicle and this obstacle raises some concern, though there is still a reasonable separation distance at the current time step.  The time to collision is not immediate but needs to be monitored.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3

- Obstacle ID: 3051.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 3051.0 is in a different lanelet (18.0) and is significantly further away from the ego vehicle. Its trajectory shows no indication of approaching the ego vehicle's path.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Despite its high velocity, the obstacle's direction and distance pose no immediate time-related threat to the ego vehicle.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. **Most critical obstacle:** Obstacle 3049.0 poses the most immediate risk due to its presence in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle, its higher velocity, and its decreasing distance to the ego vehicle over the observed timesteps.
2. **Trajectory analysis:** Obstacle 3049.0's trajectory consistently shows it moving towards the ego vehicle from behind within the same lanelet.  Obstacles 3046.0 and 3047.0 are moving laterally away from the ego vehicle's lane, and Obstacle 3051.0 remains distant and in a different lane.
3. **Relative positions, velocities, and accelerations:** The ego vehicle is decelerating, while Obstacle 3049.0 is accelerating, though slightly. This results in a steadily decreasing distance between the two.
4. **Collision determination:**  At the current timestep, no collision has occurred.  However, if the current trends in velocity and acceleration continue, a rear-end collision between the ego vehicle and Obstacle 3049.0 is possible in the near future.
5. **Reasoning:** The continuous decrease in longitudinal distance combined with the velocity differences between the ego vehicle and obstacle 3049.0 suggests a growing risk of a rear-end collision.

    "IsCollisionScenario": false,
    "Reasoning": "While no collision has occurred yet, Obstacle 3049.0 poses a medium risk due to its closing velocity and position behind the ego vehicle in the same lane. Continued deceleration of the ego vehicle and acceleration of Obstacle 3049.0 may lead to a rear-end collision in the near future."
