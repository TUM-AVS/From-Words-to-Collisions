### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep (0.9 seconds):

### Obstacle Analysis:
1. **Obstacle ID: 3046**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Located at (629.279, 661.0966), moving away from ego (618.6331, 656.2692). Distance is increasing over time.
   - **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: Velocity (7.1068) is similar to ego's (2.8346), but moving away. No immediate collision risk.
   - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 5

2. **Obstacle ID: 3047**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Located at (632.9242, 651.6722), moving laterally away from ego. Distance is stable/increasing.
   - **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: Velocity (6.5566) is higher than ego's, but trajectory diverges. No collision path.
   - **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 4

3. **Obstacle ID: 3049**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Located in same lanelet (84.0) at (605.5803, 655.9008), behind ego but closing distance.
   - **Distance safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: Velocity (7.182) is higher than ego's (2.8346), but decelerating (-3.702). TTC is sufficient.
   - **Time safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 3

4. **Obstacle ID: 3051**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Located at (636.4993, 668.7215), moving away at high speed (40.7459). No overlap with ego's path.
   - **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: Extremely high velocity but perpendicular trajectory. No collision risk.
   - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 5

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. No obstacles are in immediate collision path (risk score 0).
2. Obstacle 3049 is the closest risk but is decelerating and still behind ego.
3. All other obstacles are moving away or on non-intersecting paths.
4. Ego is decelerating, reducing collision risk further.
