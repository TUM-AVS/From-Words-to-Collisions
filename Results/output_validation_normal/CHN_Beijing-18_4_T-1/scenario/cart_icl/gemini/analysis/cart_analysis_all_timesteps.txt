- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is far from ego and moving away laterally.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason:  No time-based risk due to lateral movement.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
No obstacle poses an immediate collision risk. Obstacle 3049 is approaching from behind at a higher speed, requiring monitoring. This is not a collision scenario.
