### Obstacle Analysis:

#### Obstacle ID: 3045.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: The closest point of approach to the ego vehicle shows a significant separation both longitudinally and laterally due to their positions in different lanelets. The distance remains substantial over the previous timesteps.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: This obstacle has a relatively high velocity but maintains its course in a separate lanelet with no indication of an impending collision course throughout the timeframes.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 3046.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: Positioned in a neighboring lanelet and moving largely parallel to the ego vehicle. Historical trajectory shows no convergence towards the ego's path.
- **Distance safety score**: 4
- **Time Risk reason**: The obstacle moves with a consistent speed and behavior, maintaining a safe distance without significant change in acceleration towards the ego.
- **Time safety score**: 4
- **Overall Risk score**: 4

#### Obstacle ID: 3047.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: Although initially close, it occupies a separate lanelet and is moving away over time. No substantial converging trajectory observed.
- **Distance safety score**: 4
- **Time Risk reason**: The consistent lateral movement in the opposite direction of the ego’s travel path indicates low likelihood of future intersection.
- **Time safety score**: 4
- **Overall Risk score**: 4

#### Obstacle ID: 3049.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: This obstacle is in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle and demonstrates decreasing distance with a faster relative speed—a growing concern.
- **Distance safety score**: 3
- **Time Risk reason**: The negative acceleration trend may limit the risk habitat temporally, yet the decreasing separation warrants caution.
- **Time safety score**: 3
- **Overall Risk score**: 3

#### Obstacle ID: 3050.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: It remains substantially distant from the ego vehicle with no direct converging path. The obstacle maintains its lane trajectory.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: The velocity and acceleration fluctuations point to a minimal threat, as it maintains a separate and distant path.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 3051.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: Despite high velocity, it traverses far from the ego vehicle's path, indicating a negligible collision risk.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: The obstacle’s trajectory does not interplay with the ego, maintaining a consistent and high-speed path in a different lanelet.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. Historical data illustrates that obstacles other than 3049.0 have predominantly maintained or increased their separation from the ego vehicle, ensuring no collision course.
2. Obstacle 3049.0, within the ego vehicle's lanelet, exhibits a dynamic risk due to decreasing distance but lacks immediacy for extreme risk due to the moderate time buffer for potential adjustments.
3. The evaluation confirms no immediate collision course, and the proactive speed adjustments by the ego could mitigate residual concerns.
