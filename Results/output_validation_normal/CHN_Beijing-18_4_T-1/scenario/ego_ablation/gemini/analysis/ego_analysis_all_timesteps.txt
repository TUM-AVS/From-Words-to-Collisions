Obstacle 3046 is approaching the ego vehicle from the front-left, with a longitudinal distance of 6.27 meters and a lateral distance of 2.91 meters. The relative longitudinal velocity is -9.31 m/s, indicating it is moving towards the ego car.  The lateral velocity is -2.93 m/s, also closing the gap. While the longitudinal distance is concerning, it's the combination of both decreasing distances and velocities over the short timeframe that makes this obstacle a potential extreme risk.

Obstacle 3049 is approaching the ego vehicle from behind with a longitudinal distance of -8.55 meters. Although the relative longitudinal velocity is 4.35 m/s, suggesting it's closing in, the consistent lateral distance of 0.00 m and low lateral velocity mitigate the collision risk. The closing longitudinal distance does pose some risk, but it doesn't present an extreme risk at this immediate timestep.

Obstacle 3047 is moving away laterally from the ego car but is still approaching longitudinally at a slow relative speed (-1.20 m/s). The longitudinal distance of 9.64 meters and the increasing lateral distance (-3.40 m) suggest a low risk.


Obstacle 3051 is moving away laterally to the left with a large lateral distance of 10.32 m and poses no immediate threat despite the decreasing longitudinal distance.

  "ScenarioAnalysis": {
    "IsCollisionScenario": false,
    "Reasoning": "Obstacle 3046 poses an extreme risk due to its close proximity (6.27m longitudinal, 2.91m lateral) and high closing velocities (-9.31 m/s longitudinal, -2.93 m/s lateral) suggesting a likely collision in the next few timesteps.  While other obstacles are present, none present an immediate collision risk in the latest timestep."
