At t=0.9s, Obstacle 3046 is closest to the ego vehicle with a longitudinal distance of 6.27m and lateral distance of 2.91m, and it's approaching the ego vehicle both longitudinally and laterally. While the distances are decreasing, there is no indication of an imminent collision in the next timestep. Obstacle 3049 is approaching from behind and is at -8.55m longitudinally. Obstacle 3047 is moving away laterally to the right, and Obstacle 3051 is moving away laterally to the left.  No immediate collision is indicated in the next timestep with any obstacle.

**Risk Levels and Definitions:**
<Collision (Score: 0)>: Actual collision has occurred or is unavoidable within the next timestep.
<Extreme Risk (Score: 1)>: Immediate collision or very high likelihood of impact. Urgent action is required.
<High Risk (Score: 2)>: Close to collision or highly probable collision path. Needs prompt attention and quick manoeuvring.
<Medium Risk (Score: 3)>: Moderate collision risk but manageable with timely reactions and proper strategies.
<Low Risk (Score: 4)>: Minimal collision risk. The situation is controllable with sufficient time to react.
<Negligible Risk (Score: 5)>: No significant collision risk. Obstacles are either moving away or far enough not to interfere.
