### Safety analysis for timestep 0.9 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 3046**
- Distance Risk reason: At 0.9 seconds, Obstacle 3046 is located 6.27m longitudinally and 6.27m laterally in the front-left of the ego vehicle. It's approaching the ego vehicle both longitudinally and laterally with negative relative velocities (-9.31 m/s longitudinal and -2.93 m/s lateral). This close proximity and closing motion present a high risk.
- Distance safety score: 2 (High Risk)
- Time Risk reason: The continuous reduction in distance, coupled with the current velocities, suggests a very short time to collision.
- Time safety score: 2 (High Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 2 (High Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 3047**
- Distance Risk reason: At 0.9 seconds, Obstacle 3047 is 9.64m longitudinally and 9.64m laterally from the ego vehicle, positioned to the front-right. Although it's moving towards the ego vehicle longitudinally (-1.20 m/s), it's moving away laterally (-6.35 m/s).  This lateral motion mitigates some risk.
- Distance safety score: 3 (Medium Risk)
- Time Risk reason: The longitudinal closing velocity is relatively slow, providing more time to react compared to obstacle 3046.
- Time safety score: 3 (Medium Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 3 (Medium Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 3049**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 3049 is behind the ego vehicle at -8.55m longitudinally and -8.55m laterally.  It is approaching longitudinally with a velocity of 4.35 m/s. The scenario context implies that it might move towards the ego vehicle based on its movement from 0.0 seconds to 0.9 seconds.
- Distance safety score: 3 (Medium Risk)
- Time Risk reason:  The closing velocity indicates a moderate TTC. While behind the ego vehicle, it's important to consider potential lane changes or maneuvers by either vehicle that could increase risk.
- Time safety score: 3 (Medium Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 3 (Medium Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 3051**
- Distance Risk reason: At 0.9 seconds, Obstacle 3051 is 13.71m longitudinally and 13.71m laterally away, located to the front-left. While its longitudinal velocity (-2.96 m/s) indicates it's closing in, the lateral velocity (40.75 m/s) shows significant movement away from the ego vehicle. This high lateral velocity reduces the collision risk.
- Distance safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
- Time Risk reason: The high lateral velocity suggests it will quickly move out of the ego vehicle's path, resulting in a larger TTC.
- Time safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 4 (Low Risk)
