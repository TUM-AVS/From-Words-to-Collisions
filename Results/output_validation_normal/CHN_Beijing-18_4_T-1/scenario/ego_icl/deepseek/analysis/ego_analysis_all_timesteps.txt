### Obstacle-by-Obstacle Analysis (Most Recent Timestep: 0.9s)

#### **Obstacle 3046 (Front-left)**
- **Adjusted Distance**: Longitudinal 6.27m, Lateral 2.91m  
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal -9.31 m/s (approaching), Lateral -2.93 m/s (approaching from left)  
- **Motion**: Driving toward ego both longitudinally and laterally  
- **TTC Longitudinal**: 6.27 / 9.31 ≈ 0.67s  
- **TTC Lateral**: 2.91 / 2.93 ≈ 0.99s  
- **MDC**: Minimum distance is lateral (2.91m) since longitudinal distance is larger but closing rapidly.  
- **Risk Assessment**:  
  - TTC (longitudinal): 0.67s → High Risk (2)  
  - TTC (lateral): 0.99s → High Risk (2)  
  - MDC: 2.91m → Medium Risk (3)  
  - **Overall Risk**: High Risk (2)  

#### **Obstacle 3047 (Front-right)**
- **Adjusted Distance**: Longitudinal 9.64m, Lateral -3.40m  
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal -1.20 m/s (approaching slowly), Lateral -6.35 m/s (moving away to right)  
- **Motion**: Driving toward ego longitudinally but moving away laterally  
- **TTC Longitudinal**: 9.64 / 1.20 ≈ 8.03s (No Risk, diverging laterally)  
- **MDC**: Lateral distance increasing → No Risk (5)  
- **Risk Assessment**:  
  - **Overall Risk**: No Risk (5)  

#### **Obstacle 3049 (Behind)**
- **Adjusted Distance**: Longitudinal -8.55m, Lateral 0.00m  
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal 4.35 m/s (approaching from behind), Lateral 0.00 m/s  
- **Motion**: Driving toward ego from behind with exact lateral alignment  
- **TTC Longitudinal**: 8.55 / 4.35 ≈ 1.97s  
- **MDC**: Lateral alignment but longitudinal distance closing → Medium Risk (3)  
- **Risk Assessment**:  
  - **Overall Risk**: Medium Risk (3)  

#### **Obstacle 3051 (Front-left)**
- **Adjusted Distance**: Longitudinal 13.71m, Lateral 10.32m  
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal -2.96 m/s (approaching), Lateral 40.75 m/s (moving away left rapidly)  
- **Motion**: Driving toward ego longitudinally but moving away laterally  
- **TTC Longitudinal**: 13.71 / 2.96 ≈ 4.63s  
- **MDC**: Lateral distance increasing rapidly → Low Risk (4)  
- **Risk Assessment**:  
  - **Overall Risk**: Low Risk (4)

### Trajectory Analysis
- **Obstacle 3046** is the most critical: Rapidly closing both longitudinally and laterally (TTC < 1s in both dimensions).  
- **Obstacle 3049** is approaching from behind but at a slower rate (TTC ≈ 2s).  
- Other obstacles are either diverging or pose minimal risk.  

---

### Collision Scenario Determination
- No obstacle has a risk score of 0 (collision) or 1 (extreme risk).  
- Highest risk is Obstacle 3046 (High Risk, score 2).
