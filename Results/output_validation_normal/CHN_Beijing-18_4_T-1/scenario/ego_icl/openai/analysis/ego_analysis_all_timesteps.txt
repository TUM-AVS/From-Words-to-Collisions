Based on the provided data, I will perform an obstacle-by-obstacle analysis focusing on the most recent timestep (0.9 seconds). I will calculate the Time-to-Collision (TTC) and Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC) to assess risks and determine if any collisions are imminent.

### Obstacle-by-Obstacle Analysis at 0.9 seconds

#### Obstacle 3046:
- **Adjusted Distances**: Longitudinal 6.27 m, Lateral 2.91 m
- **Relative Velocities**: Longitudinal -9.31 m/s, Lateral -2.93 m/s

##### Trajectory Analysis:
- Previous timesteps show steady approach both longitudinally and laterally.
- Maintaining a negative relative longitudinal velocity indicates the obstacle continues to close the gap rapidly. Lateral distance is also decreasing.

##### Calculations:
- **TTC (Longitudinal)**: \( \text{TTC} = \frac{6.27}{|-9.31|} \approx 0.67 \) seconds
- **MDC**: Smaller of the adjusted distances when paths converge, anywhere below the threshold of 1.0 meters constitutes high risk.

##### Risk Assessment:
- **TTC**: High Risk (score 2) since TTC < 1.0 seconds.
- **MDC**: High Risk (score 2) due to convergence risks within low meters.
  
**Overall Risk Score**: 2 (High Risk)

#### Obstacle 3047:
- **Adjusted Distances**: Longitudinal 9.64 m, Lateral -3.40 m
- **Relative Velocities**: Longitudinal -1.20 m/s, Lateral -6.35 m/s

##### Trajectory Analysis:
- The obstacle moves away laterally to the right, indicating diverging paths.

##### Calculations:
- **TTC (Longitudinal)**: \( \text{TTC} = \frac{9.64}{|-1.20|} \approx 8.03 \) seconds
- **MDC**: Far enough longitudinally and laterally diverging.

##### Risk Assessment:
- **TTC**: No Risk (score 5) due to high separation time.
- **MDC**: No Risk (score 5), diverging paths.

**Overall Risk Score**: 5 (No Risk)

#### Obstacle 3049:
- **Adjusted Distances**: Longitudinal -8.55 m
- **Relative Velocities**: Longitudinal 4.35 m/s, Lateral 0.00 m/s

##### Trajectory Analysis:
- Steadily gaining speed relative to the ego vehicle, following directly behind.

##### Calculations:
- **TTC (Longitudinal)**: \( \text{TTC} = \frac{8.55}{4.35} \approx 1.97 \) seconds
- **MDC**: Direct path following could become problematic but largely influenced by vehicle speed gap.

##### Risk Assessment:
- **TTC**: Medium Risk (score 3), enough time to act.
- **MDC**: Medium Risk (score 3), assessing the traffic dynamics.

**Overall Risk Score**: 3 (Medium Risk)

#### Obstacle 3051:
- **Adjusted Distances**: Longitudinal 13.71 m, Lateral 10.32 m
- **Relative Velocities**: Longitudinal -2.96 m/s, Lateral 40.75 m/s

##### Trajectory Analysis:
- Lateral movement is significant, suggesting limited immediate collision potential.

##### Calculations:
- **TTC (Longitudinal)**: High lateral velocity ensures quick repositioning.
- **MDC**: Relative safety due to lateral distance and obstacle dynamic.

##### Risk Assessment:
- **TTC**: No Risk (score 5).
- **MDC**: No Risk (score 5), high lateral velocity rearrangement observed.

**Overall Risk Score**: 5 (No Risk)

### Conclusion:
- **No obstacle** at the most recent timestamp poses an **extreme risk** (score of 0 or 1).
- Obstacle 3046 exhibits a high risk but not immediate collision potential.

### JSON Summary:
```json
{
    "CollisionObstacle": null,
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null,
    "IsCollisionScenario": false,
    "Justification": "No individual obstacle identified as having a risk score of 0 (collision) or 1 (extreme risk). Obstacle 3046 has the highest risk score of 2, indicating potential concern but not immediate collision."
}
```

This analysis indicates that while there are potential concerns, particularly with obstacle 3046, there is no immediate collision scenario.
