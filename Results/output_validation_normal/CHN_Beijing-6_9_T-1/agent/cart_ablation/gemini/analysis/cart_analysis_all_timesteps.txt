The ego vehicle (3101) is changing lanes, moving from lanelet 39 to 338.  It's also decelerating significantly in the first few timesteps.  Let's analyze the obstacles:

* **Obstacle 3095:** Stationary. Poses no immediate threat.
* **Obstacle 3097:**  Moving slowly and decelerating in the same lanelet (63) as 3095.  Doesn't appear to be a collision risk with the ego vehicle.
* **Obstacle 3098:** Moving in a different lanelet (64). While its speed is increasing, its trajectory doesn't seem to intersect with the ego vehicle's in the near future based on the provided data.
* **Obstacle 3102:** Also in lanelet 63 and decelerating, similar to 3097. Not a direct risk to the ego vehicle.
* **Obstacle 3106:** This obstacle is in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle initially (39), and it's moving considerably faster.  However, the data provided does not indicate an immediate collision risk, though continued observation is necessary to confirm this given the speed difference and potential future lane changes of the ego vehicle.

Based on the given data, there are no immediate collisions or extreme risks. Further information and future timesteps are needed for a more complete assessment.
