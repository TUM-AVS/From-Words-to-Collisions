The ego vehicle (3101) starts in lanelet 39 and changes to lanelet 338 between 0.6 and 0.7 seconds.  It is decelerating throughout the provided timeframe.

Obstacle 3095 is stationary. Its position relative to the ego vehicle and the ego vehicle's deceleration suggest no immediate risk of collision.

Obstacles 3097 and 3102 are also relatively far from the ego vehicle and moving slowly. While monitoring is necessary, they don't present an immediate collision risk within the given timeframe.

Obstacle 3098 is moving with a significant velocity in lanelet 64, which seems to be close to lanelets 63 and 39 based on the other obstacles' positions. However, its x-coordinate remains consistently lower than the ego vehicle's, and it is even more distant in the y coordinate suggesting the trajectories are diverging, reducing collision risk.

Obstacle 3106 appears in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle (39 initially) at 0.4 seconds. It's moving at a higher velocity than the ego vehicle.  However, it is significantly behind the ego vehicle, and the ego vehicle is decelerating.  Further monitoring is necessary, but within this timeframe, it does not pose an immediate threat. Since the ego vehicle changes to lanelet 338, this further reduces the risk of collision.

Therefore, within the provided 0.9-second timeframe, no obstacle poses a collision risk or extreme risk to the ego vehicle.
