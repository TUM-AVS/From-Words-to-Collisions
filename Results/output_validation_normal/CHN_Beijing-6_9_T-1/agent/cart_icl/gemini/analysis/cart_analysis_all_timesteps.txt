At t=0.9s, the ego vehicle (ID 3101) is at (257.3612, 558.1993) in lanelet 338. Let's analyze the risk posed by each obstacle:

* **Obstacle 3095:** Stationary and far from the ego vehicle's trajectory. Negligible risk.
* **Obstacle 3097:**  Slow-moving and far from the ego vehicle's trajectory. Negligible risk.
* **Obstacle 3098:** Moving in a different lanelet (64) than the ego vehicle (338). Although its X-coordinate is somewhat close to the ego vehicle, the different lanelets suggest they are on different paths, and the Y-coordinate difference is significant. Low risk.
* **Obstacle 3102:**  Slow-moving and far from the ego vehicle's trajectory. Negligible risk.
* **Obstacle 3106:** Located in the same lanelet (39) as the ego vehicle was initially and is moving with a higher velocity. It is also positioned significantly behind the ego vehicle. Since both vehicles are moving in the same direction, the difference in the Y coordinate and the lanelets the ego vehicle and obstacle 3106 is located at the specific timesteps need to be considered for collision assessment. Based on the provided data, a collision doesn't seem imminent, but requires further monitoring, given the high speed of obstacle 3106.  Medium risk.
