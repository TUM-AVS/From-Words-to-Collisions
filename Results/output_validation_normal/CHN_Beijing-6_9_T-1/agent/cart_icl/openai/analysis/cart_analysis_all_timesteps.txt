### Analysis

**Ego Vehicle Trajectory:**
- Over the course of 0.9 seconds, the Ego vehicle (ID: 3101) travels along lanelet 39.0 and transitions to lanelet 338.0.
- The velocity of the Ego vehicle decreases from 10.1712 m/s to 7.4914 m/s, indicating a slowing motion due to negative acceleration.
  
**Obstacle Trajectories and Assessment:**

1. **Obstacle 3095 (Stationary Obstacle):**
   - Static position at (265.5105, 549.759) indicates no motion and no significant risk of collision with the Ego vehicle. Distance from the Ego vehicle is approximately 18m along the y-axis at the final time step.

2. **Obstacle 3097:**
   - Remains in lanelet 63.0 with a slight motion, moving with a velocity decreasing from 0.6596 m/s to 0.3177 m/s.
   - Minimal risk as this obstacle is not in the path of the Ego vehicle. Distance decreases, but the small relative velocity on a different lanelet poses no immediate threat.

3. **Obstacle 3098:**
   - Exhibits significant motion and acceleration, with velocities increasing to 9.5084 m/s towards the end at lanelet 64.0.
   - The obstacle's path does not intersect with the Ego's lanelet for the given assessment period, presenting a low risk.

4. **Obstacle 3102:**
   - Remains in lanelet 63.0, moving with a decreasing velocity. At the established path, there is no collision risk due to consistently non-threatening positioning relative to the Ego vehicle.

5. **Obstacle 3106:**
   - Moves in lanelet 39.0 with significant velocity, reaching 14.3638 m/s, suggesting it is closing in from behind.
   - Since it remains in the same lanelet and is approaching rapidly, the risk is potentially high, however, at the time stamp of 0.9 seconds, distance still greater due to lanelet transition of Ego vehicle.

**Risk Assessment Example:**

Given the data and trend history, no obstacle exhibits a behavior that would result in an immediate collision or extreme risk to the Ego vehicle within the scenario timeframe.

In this scenario, all traffic participants maintain a safe distance and trajectory from the Ego vehicle within the timeline reviewed. The absence of collision-prone dynamics results in no exceedingly high-risk outcomes.
