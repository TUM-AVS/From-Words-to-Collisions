Obstacle 3098 is at high risk of collision with the ego vehicle. At the most recent timestep (0.9 seconds), it is positioned to the right of the ego with a longitudinal distance of 0.0 m and a lateral distance of -15.87 m.  The lateral distance suggests a possible sideswipe collision if the ego vehicle were to move slightly to the right. The longitudinal alignment (0.0m) indicates they occupy the same lane lengthwise. Its relative longitudinal velocity is -7.56 m/s and the relative lateral velocity is -9.51 m/s.  The fact that it's moving towards the ego longitudinally and away from the ego laterally could result in different outcomes. The fact the longitudinal distance is 0.0, makes this a dangerous situation.

Obstacles 3095, 3097, and 3102 are also approaching the ego vehicle and should be monitored but are not immediately high risk. However, at 0.9 seconds, Obstacles 3095 and 3097 are quite close to the ego vehicle, 3.52m and 3.43m longitudinally, respectively and both maintain the longitudinal closing velocity of -7.49 m/s. They represent potential risks and require close observation. Obstacle 3106 is behind the ego vehicle and moving towards it longitudinally, currently not at high risk.
