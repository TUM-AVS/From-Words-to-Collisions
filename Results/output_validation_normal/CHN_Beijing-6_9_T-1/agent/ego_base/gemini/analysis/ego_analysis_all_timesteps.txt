Obstacle 3098 is at extreme risk of collision with the ego vehicle. At t=0.9s, it is directly to the right of the ego car (0.0m longitudinal distance) and only 15.87m lateral distance away.  Its longitudinal velocity suggests it might be attempting to merge or cut in front of the ego vehicle.  The lateral velocity shows continued movement away from the ego vehicle but the small longitudinal distance represents an immediate and extreme collision risk.

Obstacle 3095, 3097, and 3102 are all approaching the ego vehicle longitudinally from the front-right. While not immediately critical, they present a high risk that requires close monitoring.  Obstacle 3095 is the closest at 3.52m longitudinally, followed by 3097 at 3.43m, and then 3102 at 3.34m.  All three have negative longitudinal velocities, indicating movement towards the ego vehicle. Their lateral positions and velocities suggest they are likely in different lanes, but their continued approach represents a high risk of potential future collision.

Obstacle 3106 is approaching from behind but poses a lower risk than the obstacles in front. It is still a considerable distance away (-22.20m longitudinally).  Its longitudinal velocity indicates that it is closing the distance to the ego car, requiring continued observation.
