Let me analyze each obstacle at the most recent timestep (0.9 seconds) with trajectory context:

1. Obstacle 3095 (Front-right):
   - Adjusted distances: longitudinal 3.52m, lateral -6.95m
   - Velocities: longitudinal -7.49 m/s (approaching), lateral 0.00 m/s
   - TTC (longitudinal): 3.52/7.49 = 0.47s (Extreme Risk)
   - MDC (lateral): 6.95m (No Risk)
   - Trajectory: Consistently approaching longitudinally with stable lateral distance
   - Overall Risk: Extreme Risk (1) due to imminent longitudinal collision

2. Obstacle 3097 (Front-right):
   - Adjusted distances: longitudinal 3.43m, lateral -14.76m
   - Velocities: longitudinal -7.49 m/s, lateral 0.32 m/s
   - TTC (longitudinal): 3.43/7.49 = 0.46s (Extreme Risk)
   - MDC (lateral): 14.76m (No Risk)
   - Trajectory: Similar to 3095 but with larger lateral buffer
   - Overall Risk: Extreme Risk (1)

3. Obstacle 3098 (Right):
   - Adjusted distances: longitudinal 0.00m, lateral -15.87m
   - Velocities: longitudinal -7.56 m/s, lateral -9.51 m/s (moving away)
   - TTC: Not applicable (moving away in both dimensions)
   - MDC: 15.87m (No Risk)
   - Trajectory: Has passed longitudinal alignment while moving away laterally
   - Overall Risk: No Risk (5)

4. Obstacle 3102 (Front-right):
   - Adjusted distances: longitudinal 3.34m, lateral -23.52m
   - Velocities: longitudinal -7.48 m/s, lateral 1.18 m/s
   - TTC (longitudinal): 3.34/7.48 = 0.45s (Extreme Risk)
   - MDC (lateral): 23.52m (No Risk)
   - Trajectory: Similar to 3095/3097 with even larger lateral buffer
   - Overall Risk: Extreme Risk (1)

5. Obstacle 3106 (Behind):
   - Adjusted distances: longitudinal -22.20m, lateral 0.00m
   - Velocities: longitudinal 6.86 m/s (approaching from behind)
   - TTC: 22.20/6.86 = 3.24s (Medium Risk)
   - MDC: 22.20m (No Risk)
   - Trajectory: Slowly approaching from rear with exact lateral alignment
   - Overall Risk: Medium Risk (3)

JSON Summary:

    "CollisionObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "None",
        "OverallRiskScore": "None"
    },
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "3095,3097,3102",

    },
    "HighRiskObstacle": {

        "OverallRiskScore": "None"
    }
}

Key Findings:
- Multiple obstacles (3095, 3097, 3102) present Extreme Risk (TTC < 0.5s) due to rapid longitudinal approach
- No actual collisions occurring yet
- Obstacle 3098 has passed by safely
- Rear obstacle 3106 presents Medium Risk but with sufficient time to react
- Primary threat is from front-right approaching vehicles
