Let's proceed with the analysis of each obstacle from the context provided:

### Obstacle 3095
- **Current Position and Motion**: At 0.9 seconds, the Obstacle 3095 is in the Front-right of the ego car, with an adjusted longitudinal distance of 3.52 m and a lateral distance of -6.95 m. The relative velocity is -7.49 m/s longitudinally and 0.00 m/s laterally.
- **Trajectory**: The obstacle is consistently decreasing its longitudinal distance to the ego car, indicating approaching motion.
- **TTC Calculation**: 
  - Longitudinal TTC = 3.52 m / 7.49 m/s ≈ 0.47 seconds.
  - The lateral velocity is 0, meaning no closing or diverging motion laterally.
- **MDC Calculation**: Since the obstacle is primarily closing longitudinally at a significant rate, the MDC approaches near the longitudinal distance.
- **Risk Assessment**: 
  - Due to a longitudinal TTC of 0.47 seconds, this presents an extreme risk (score 1).

### Obstacle 3097
- **Current Position and Motion**: At 0.9 seconds, Obstacle 3097 is in the Front-right, with longitudinal 3.43 m and lateral -14.76 m. Relative velocity longitudinally is -7.49 m/s, laterally 0.32 m/s.
- **Trajectory**: Approaching longitudinally and slightly laterally converging.
- **TTC Calculation**:
  - Longitudinal TTC = 3.43 m / 7.49 m/s ≈ 0.46 seconds.
  - Lateral TTC = 14.76 m / 0.32 m/s ≈ 46.13 seconds.
- **MDC Calculation**: The longitudinal path is the main concern as it affects the collision.
- **Risk Assessment**:
  - Longitudinal TTC indicates an extreme risk (score 1).

### Obstacle 3098
- **Current Position and Motion**: At 0.9 seconds, this obstacle is to the right of the ego car (adjusted longitudinal distance 0.00 m, lateral distance -15.87 m). The relative velocity is -7.56 m/s longitudinally and -9.51 m/s laterally.
- **Trajectory**: The obstacle has practically aligned longitudinally but is rapidly moving away laterally.
- **TTC Calculation**:
  - Longitudinal is not directly relevant since the lateral movement is dominant.
  - lateral TTC ≈ irrelevant for collision as lateral is increasing; diverging laterally.
- **MDC Calculation**: Primary concern is missed as lateral distance remains substantial and increasing.
- **Risk Assessment**: 
  - Negligible risk (score 5) as obstacle is diverging laterally.

### Obstacle 3102
- **Current Position and Motion**: Observed in the Front-right at 0.9 seconds, longitudinal 3.34 m, lateral -23.52 m. Relatively, it moves at -7.48 m/s longitudinally, 1.18 m/s laterally.
- **Trajectory**: Continuous closing longitudinally, yet a bit lateral merging.
- **TTC Calculation**:
  - Longitudinal TTC = 3.34 m / 7.48 m/s ≈ 0.45 seconds.
  - Lateral TTC > 23.52 m / 1.18 m/s ≈ 19.93 seconds.
- **MDC Calculation**: Main concern is longitudinal at a close distance.
- **Risk Assessment**:
  - Due to the short longitudinal TTC, extreme risk (score 1).

### Obstacle 3106
- **Current Position and Motion**: In the rear, longitudinally -22.20 m (consistent lateral 0.00 m alignment). Closing in at 6.86 m/s.
- **Trajectory**: Approaching from behind with continuous closing speed.
- **TTC Calculation**:
  - Longitudinal TTC = 22.20 m / 6.86 m/s ≈ 3.24 seconds.
- **MDC Calculation**: Behind risk-wise.
- **Risk Assessment**:
  - With adequate time to react longitudinally, this is a low risk (score 4).

### Final Risk Assessment

    "CollisionObstacle": {

        "OverallRiskScore": "0"
    },
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "3095",

}
```

### Analysis Summary
- **Extreme Risk Obstacles** include 3095 and 3102 due to extremely short TTC when approaching.
- **Obstacle 3098** is rapidly diverging laterally, mitigating collision risk despite alignment, showing negligible risk.
- **Obstacle 3106** at a rear position presents a manageable, low-risk scenario given the ego car's forward motion.
- The obstacles are evaluated primarily for imminent collision capacity with proximity and direction, focusing on trajectories and velocity data.
