At t=0.9s, Ego (3101.0) is at (257.3612, 558.1993) in lanelet 338.0. Let's analyze the obstacles:

* **Obstacle 3095.0:** Stationary at (265.5105, 549.759) in lanelet 63.0.  No immediate risk, given the separation and Ego's trajectory.

* **Obstacle 3097.0:**  At (265.5423, 541.9484) in lanelet 63.0, moving slowly. No immediate risk due to distance.

* **Obstacle 3098.0:** At (262.0388, 540.7894) in lanelet 64.0.  Moving relatively quickly.  Still some lateral separation, but worth monitoring.  Not an immediate risk.

* **Obstacle 3102.0:**  At (265.578, 533.1923) in lanelet 63.0.  Slowing down.  No immediate risk.

* **Obstacle 3106.0:** At (230.6683, 556.7168) in lanelet 39.0. This obstacle is behind Ego and poses no immediate threat.
