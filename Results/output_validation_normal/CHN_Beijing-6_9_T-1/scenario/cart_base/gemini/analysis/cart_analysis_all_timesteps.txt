At t=0.9s, Ego (3101.0) is at (257.3612, 558.1993) in lanelet 338.0.  Let's analyze the obstacles:

* **3095.0:** Stationary at (265.5105, 549.759) in lanelet 63.0.  No immediate risk.
* **3097.0:** Slowing down at (265.5423, 541.9484) in lanelet 63.0. No immediate risk.
* **3098.0:**  At (262.0388, 540.7894) in lanelet 64.0, moving with a velocity of 9.5084 and accelerating.  Given the different lanelets and the current positions, there is no immediate risk.
* **3102.0:**  At (265.578, 533.1923) in lanelet 63.0 and slowing down.  No immediate risk.
* **3106.0:** At (230.6683, 556.7168) in lanelet 39.0, traveling at 14.3638 and accelerating. This obstacle is behind Ego in the same lanelet but significantly far away. Therefore, there is no immediate risk.

No obstacle poses an immediate collision or extreme risk.
