### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 3095.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is located at (265.5105, 549.759) while ego is at (257.3612, 558.1993).  While in different lanelets, their y-coordinates are relatively close. History shows this obstacle is stationary.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Obstacle is stationary, posing no immediate time-related risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 4

- Obstacle ID: 3097.0
- Distance Risk reason: Located at (265.5423, 541.9484) while ego is at (257.3612, 558.1993). The x-coordinates suggest potential risk if ego were to change lanes, but the y-coordinates show significant separation. History indicates it's moving slowly and decelerating.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Slow velocity and deceleration suggest low time-related risk.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- Obstacle ID: 3098.0
- Distance Risk reason: Positioned at (262.0388, 540.7894) with ego at (257.3612, 558.1993). Although x-coordinates are relatively close, y-coordinates show substantial separation. History shows it's moving in a different lanelet and its trajectory isn't intersecting with the ego's.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Moving faster than other obstacles, but its trajectory doesn't pose a direct threat based on historical data.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- Obstacle ID: 3102.0
- Distance Risk reason:  At (265.578, 533.1923) while ego is at (257.3612, 558.1993). Significant separation in both x and y coordinates, and history shows its movement is not towards the ego vehicle.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Slow and decelerating, presenting no immediate time-related risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 3106.0
- Distance Risk reason:  Located at (230.6683, 556.7168) while ego is at (257.3612, 558.1993). The y-coordinates are very close indicating they are in the same lane, but the historical data shows this vehicle is behind the ego and moving at a higher speed.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason:  The obstacle is approaching the ego from behind at a higher speed, potentially leading to a dangerous situation in the future.  However, currently, there is enough separation.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4


### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. **Most critical obstacles:** Obstacle 3106.0 poses the most potential risk, as it's traveling in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle at a higher speed and approaching from behind. While the current separation offers some safety margin, the closing velocity warrants attention.  Other obstacles are in different lanelets and maintain a safe distance, exhibiting no immediate risk.

2. **Trajectory analysis:** Over the 10 timesteps, the ego vehicle maintains its lane, decelerating slightly. Obstacle 3106.0 is also in the same lane, and gradually approaching the ego vehicle from behind. Other obstacles remain in their respective lanes, showing consistent movement patterns.

3. **Relative position, velocity, and acceleration:**  The ego and Obstacle 3106.0 show converging trajectories, although sufficient distance remains at this timestep. The relative velocity between the ego and Obstacle 3106.0 is concerning as they are in the same lane.

4. **Collision determination:**  No collision has occurred, and no collision is imminent at this timestep.

5. **Reasoning:** While no immediate collision is present, the closing velocity of Obstacle 3106.0 necessitates ongoing monitoring. This represents a potential for collision if current trends continue in subsequent timesteps.  All other obstacles present no foreseeable risk at this specific timestep.

        "IsCollisionScenario": false,
        "Reasoning": "No collision has occurred. Obstacle 3106.0 poses the most potential risk due to its higher speed and position behind the ego vehicle in the same lanelet, necessitating further monitoring. However, at the current timestep, sufficient separation exists to avoid an immediate collision."
