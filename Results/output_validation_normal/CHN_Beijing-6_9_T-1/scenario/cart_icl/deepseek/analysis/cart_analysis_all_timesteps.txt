### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep (0.9 seconds):

### Obstacle Analysis:
1. **Obstacle ID: 3095.0**  
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Static obstacle (velocity = 0) at (265.5105, 549.759). Ego is moving away (distance increasing).  
   - **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)  
   - **Time Risk reason**: No relative velocity (static obstacle).  
   - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)  
   - **Overall Risk score**: 5  

2. **Obstacle ID: 3097.0**  
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Moving slowly (velocity = 0.3177) at (265.5423, 541.9484). Ego is moving away (distance increasing).  
   - **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)  
   - **Time Risk reason**: Low relative velocity and decelerating.  
   - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)  
   - **Overall Risk score**: 5  

3. **Obstacle ID: 3098.0**  
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Moving toward ego's general direction but lateral separation is significant (position: 262.0388, 540.7894).  
   - **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)  
   - **Time Risk reason**: High velocity (9.5084) but lateral distance and trajectory divergence reduce risk.  
   - **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)  
   - **Overall Risk score**: 4  

4. **Obstacle ID: 3102.0**  
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Moving slowly (velocity = 1.1833) at (265.578, 533.1923). Ego is moving away.  
   - **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)  
   - **Time Risk reason**: Low relative velocity and decelerating.  
   - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)  
   - **Overall Risk score**: 5  

5. **Obstacle ID: 3106.0**  
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Behind ego (position: 230.6683, 556.7168) but moving faster (velocity = 14.3638).  
   - **Distance safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk)  
   - **Time Risk reason**: High relative velocity but still far enough for safe reaction.  
   - **Time safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk)  
   - **Overall Risk score**: 3  

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. No obstacles are in immediate collision path (risk scores â‰¥ 3).  
2. Obstacle 3098.0 has the highest risk (score 4) due to its trajectory but is not on a direct collision course.  
3. Obstacle 3106.0 is approaching from behind but is not an immediate threat.  
4. All other obstacles are either static or moving away.
