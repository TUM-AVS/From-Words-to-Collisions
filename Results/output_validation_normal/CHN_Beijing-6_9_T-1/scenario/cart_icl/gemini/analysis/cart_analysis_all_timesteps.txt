### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 3093
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is far from ego vehicle and not on a converging trajectory.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Obstacle is stationary.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5
- Obstacle ID: 3095
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is far from ego vehicle and not on a converging trajectory.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Obstacle is stationary.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5
- Obstacle ID: 3096

- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason:  Obstacle is moving with a higher velocity than the ego vehicle but likely on a diverging path based on lanelet information.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4
- Obstacle ID: 3097
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is far from ego vehicle and not on a converging trajectory.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Obstacle is moving slowly.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5
- Obstacle ID: 3098
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is far from ego vehicle and not on a converging trajectory.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Obstacle is moving at a similar velocity to the ego vehicle but on a different lanelet and not a converging path.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4
- Obstacle ID: 3099
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is far and moving away from ego vehicle. Lanelets suggest diverging paths.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason:  Obstacle is moving at a significantly higher speed than ego but on a different lanelet with no converging path.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5
- Obstacle ID: 3100
- Distance Risk reason: Moderate lateral distance but lanelets indicate diverging trajectories.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Obstacle is moving slower than ego vehicle and decelerating. Different lanelet suggests diverging trajectories.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4
- Obstacle ID: 3102
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is far from ego vehicle and not on a converging trajectory.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Obstacle is moving slowly.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5
- Obstacle ID: 3103
- Distance Risk reason: Moderate distance with diverging trajectories.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Obstacle is moving at a speed lower than the ego vehicle but on a diverging trajectory based on lanelet info.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4
- Obstacle ID: 3104
- Distance Risk reason: Far from ego vehicle, diverging trajectories.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Obstacle is moving on a separate and diverging lanelet.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5
- Obstacle ID: 3105
- Distance Risk reason: Far from ego vehicle, diverging trajectories.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Moving on a diverging lanelet.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5
- Obstacle ID: 3106
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is far behind ego vehicle and on the same lanelet.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Obstacle's higher velocity might lead to risk at a later timestamp.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4
- Obstacle ID: 3107
- Distance Risk reason: Y-coordinate suggests moderate lateral distance but lanelets indicate no intersection of trajectories.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Moving slowly, not a threat.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4
- Obstacle ID: 3108
- Distance Risk reason: Far behind ego vehicle and on the same lanelet.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Obstacle's velocity is only slightly lower than the ego vehicle's, suggesting some long-term risk on the same lanelet.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4
- Obstacle ID: 3109
- Distance Risk reason: Farther behind than 3108.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Accelerating. Moderate risk in the longer term but far enough for now.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4
- Obstacle ID: 3110
- Distance Risk reason: Far behind.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Far enough for now. Accelerating, so risk might increase at later timesteps.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4
- Obstacle ID: 3111
- Distance Risk reason:  Furthest behind.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason:  Accelerating. Significant distance makes the risk negligible for this timestep.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
No obstacle poses an immediate collision risk at this timestep. Therefore, this is not a collision scenario. However, future timesteps require monitoring, especially for obstacles 3106, 3108, 3109, 3110, and 3111 which are behind the ego vehicle and accelerating on the same lanelet (39).
