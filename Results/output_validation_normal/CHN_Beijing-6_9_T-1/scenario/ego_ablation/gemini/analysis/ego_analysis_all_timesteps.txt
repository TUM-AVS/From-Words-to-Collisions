Obstacle 3098 is at high risk of collision. It is only 0.00 m longitudinally and -15.87 m laterally away from the ego vehicle, essentially beside the ego-car. Although it's moving away laterally to the right, its longitudinal alignment suggests a possible immediate collision if its lateral movement isn't fast enough or if the ego vehicle moves towards the right.

    "IsCollisionScenario": false,
    "Reasoning": "Obstacle 3098 presents an extreme risk with a near-zero longitudinal distance to the ego vehicle in the most recent timestep, indicating a very high probability of collision. While moving to the right laterally, the near zero longitudinal distance raises serious concerns."
