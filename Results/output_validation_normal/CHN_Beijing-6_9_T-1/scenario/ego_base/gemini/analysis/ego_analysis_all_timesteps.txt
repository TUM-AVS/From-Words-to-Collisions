Obstacle 3098 is at high risk of collision. It is positioned to the right of the ego vehicle with a longitudinal distance of 0.00 m, indicating an imminent collision or overlap in the longitudinal direction.  The lateral distance is -15.87 m, suggesting it might be slightly behind the ego vehicle. The relative velocity shows that Obstacle 3098 is moving away laterally to the right (-9.51 m/s), but the longitudinal velocity indicates it's still approaching the ego vehicle (-7.56 m/s) or nearly stationary relative to it (since longitudinal distance is 0).
