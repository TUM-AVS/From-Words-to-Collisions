### Safety analysis for timestep 0.9 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 3095**
- Distance Risk reason:  Obstacle is in the Front-right at 3.52m longitudinal and 3.52m lateral distance.  This close proximity represents a high risk.
- Distance safety score: 2
- Time Risk reason: The obstacle is moving towards the ego vehicle longitudinally at -7.49 m/s. Assuming constant velocity (a simplification), TTClong is approximately 0.47 seconds. This is extremely dangerous.
- Time safety score: 1
- Overall Risk score: 1

- **Obstacle ID: 3097**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is in the Front-right at 3.43m longitudinal and 3.43m lateral distance.  This close proximity represents a high risk.
- Distance safety score: 2
- Time Risk reason: The obstacle is moving towards the ego vehicle longitudinally at -7.49 m/s and slightly laterally at 0.32 m/s. TTClong is approximately 0.46 seconds. This represents a very high risk.
- Time safety score: 1
- Overall Risk score: 1

- **Obstacle ID: 3098**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is in the Right at 0.0m longitudinal and 0.0m lateral distance. This indicates a collision.
- Distance safety score: 0
- Time Risk reason: Collision has already occurred.
- Time safety score: 0
- Overall Risk score: 0

- **Obstacle ID: 3102**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is in the Front-right at 3.34m longitudinal and 3.34m lateral distance. This close proximity indicates a high risk.
- Distance safety score: 2
- Time Risk reason:  The obstacle is moving towards the ego vehicle longitudinally at -7.48 m/s and laterally at 1.18 m/s.  TTClong is approximately 0.45 seconds. This signifies high risk.
- Time safety score: 1
- Overall Risk score: 1

- **Obstacle ID: 3106**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is Behind at -22.20m longitudinal and -22.20m lateral distance. This poses no immediate risk.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: While the obstacle is approaching from behind at 6.86 m/s, the significant distance provides ample time to react.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

{
    "CollisionObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "3098",

    },
    "IsCollisionScenario": true,
    "Justification": "Obstacle 3098 shows 0.0m distance both longitudinally and laterally, indicating a collision at the current timestep. Other obstacles (3095, 3097, and 3102) also exhibit extremely high risk due to very short TTClong and close proximity, suggesting likely imminent collisions."
