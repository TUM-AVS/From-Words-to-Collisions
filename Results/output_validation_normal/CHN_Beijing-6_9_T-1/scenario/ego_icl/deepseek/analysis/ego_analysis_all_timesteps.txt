Let me analyze each obstacle at the most recent timestep (0.9 seconds) and assess collision risks:

1. Obstacle 3095 (Front-right):
   - Adjusted distances: longitudinal 3.52m, lateral -6.95m
   - Relative velocity: longitudinal -7.49 m/s, lateral 0.00 m/s
   - Motion: Approaching longitudinally, no lateral motion
   - TTC: 3.52/7.49 = 0.47s (Extreme Risk)
   - MDC: Lateral distance is stable at 6.95m (No Risk)
   - Overall Risk: 1 (Extreme Risk due to longitudinal TTC)

2. Obstacle 3097 (Front-right):
   - Adjusted distances: longitudinal 3.43m, lateral -14.76m
   - Relative velocity: longitudinal -7.49 m/s, lateral 0.32 m/s
   - Motion: Approaching both longitudinally and laterally
   - TTC longitudinal: 3.43/7.49 = 0.46s (Extreme Risk)
   - TTC lateral: 14.76/0.32 = 46.13s (No Risk)
   - MDC: Lateral distance is large (14.76m)
   - Overall Risk: 1 (Extreme Risk due to longitudinal TTC)

3. Obstacle 3098 (Right):
   - Adjusted distances: longitudinal 0.00m, lateral -15.87m
   - Relative velocity: longitudinal -7.56 m/s, lateral -9.51 m/s
   - Motion: Exact longitudinal alignment, moving away laterally
   - TTC longitudinal: 0.00/7.56 = 0s (Collision Risk)
   - However, lateral motion is moving away (-9.51 m/s)
   - MDC: Lateral distance increasing (15.87m)
   - Overall Risk: 5 (No Risk - moving away despite longitudinal alignment)

4. Obstacle 3102 (Front-right):
   - Adjusted distances: longitudinal 3.34m, lateral -23.52m
   - Relative velocity: longitudinal -7.48 m/s, lateral 1.18 m/s
   - Motion: Approaching both longitudinally and laterally
   - TTC longitudinal: 3.34/7.48 = 0.45s (Extreme Risk)
   - TTC lateral: 23.52/1.18 = 19.93s (No Risk)
   - MDC: Lateral distance is large (23.52m)
   - Overall Risk: 1 (Extreme Risk due to longitudinal TTC)

5. Obstacle 3106 (Behind):
   - Adjusted distances: longitudinal -22.20m, lateral 0.00m
   - Relative velocity: longitudinal 6.86 m/s, lateral 0.62 m/s
   - Motion: Approaching from behind, exact lateral alignment
   - TTC longitudinal: 22.20/6.86 = 3.24s (Medium Risk)
   - MDC: Lateral distance is 0m but relative lateral velocity is positive (moving away)
   - Overall Risk: 5 (No Risk - moving away laterally despite longitudinal approach)

Trajectory Analysis:
- Obstacles 3095, 3097, and 3102 show consistent longitudinal approach with TTCs < 0.5s
- Obstacle 3098 shows exact longitudinal alignment but is moving away laterally
- Obstacle 3106 is approaching from behind but at safe distances

Collision Scenario Determination:
This is a collision scenario due to multiple obstacles (3095, 3097, 3102) having Extreme Risk (score 1) with TTCs < 0.5s in the longitudinal direction. While no actual collision is occurring at this exact moment, the imminent collision risk is extremely high.
