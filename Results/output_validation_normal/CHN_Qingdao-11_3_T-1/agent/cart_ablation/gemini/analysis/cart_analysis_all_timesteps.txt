The ego vehicle and obstacle 30702.0 are in the same lanelet (181.0).  The obstacle's x-coordinate is consistently less than the ego vehicle's, suggesting the obstacle might be slightly to the ego vehicle's right (assuming a standard coordinate system). However, the distance between them is decreasing over time.  Both vehicles are decelerating.

By calculating the distance between the ego and the obstacle at each timestep, we can see the gap closing:

* **0.1s:** sqrt((655.9883-653.8119)^2 + (-2141.3715 - -2118.9188)^2) ≈ 22.5 meters
* **0.2s:** ≈ 21.2 meters
* **0.3s:** ≈ 20.0 meters
* **0.4s:** ≈ 18.8 meters
* **0.5s:** ≈ 17.7 meters
* **0.6s:** ≈ 16.7 meters
* **0.7s:** ≈ 15.8 meters
* **0.8s:** ≈ 15.0 meters
* **0.9s:** ≈ 14.3 meters

While the distance is shrinking, the rate at which it's shrinking is also decreasing.  Furthermore, by 0.9 seconds, both vehicles' velocities are nearly matching, with the obstacle's velocity slightly lower than the ego's. This suggests that while the situation warrants monitoring, a collision isn't imminent within the timeframe of the provided data.  It represents a high risk, demanding attention to prevent a potential future collision.
