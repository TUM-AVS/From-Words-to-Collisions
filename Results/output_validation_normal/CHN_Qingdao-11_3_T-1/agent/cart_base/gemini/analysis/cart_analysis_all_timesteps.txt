The ego vehicle and obstacle 30702.0 are in the same lanelet (181.0).  The obstacle's initial x position is lower than the ego vehicle, meaning it's to the ego vehicle's left (and potentially slightly behind given the y coordinates). Both are moving forward (decreasing y coordinate).  The lateral distance between them is not decreasing significantly. However, the obstacle's velocity is consistently higher than the ego vehicle's, and the ego vehicle is decelerating more rapidly.  This means the longitudinal distance *is* decreasing over time, increasing the risk of a rear-end collision.

While a collision is not imminent in the next second, the closing velocity and the deceleration rates warrant concern. The risk level seems to be increasing over time and further projection is needed to determine if it will exceed the High-Risk threshold. For now, a Medium Risk assessment seems appropriate given the data provided.
