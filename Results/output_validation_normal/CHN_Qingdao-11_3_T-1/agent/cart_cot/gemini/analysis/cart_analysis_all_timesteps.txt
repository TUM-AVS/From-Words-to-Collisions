At t=0.9s, the ego vehicle is at (655.4534, -2131.9388) with a velocity of 9.5126 and the obstacle (ID 30702.0) is at (652.3783, -2109.5159) with a velocity of 9.5438.  Both are in the same lanelet (181.0).

**Analysis and Calculations:**

1. **Lateral Distance:**  The lateral distance between the ego and the obstacle is approximately |655.4534 - 652.3783| = 3.0751 meters.  This is a relatively small lateral distance, suggesting a potential lateral collision risk if either vehicle deviates from its current trajectory.

2. **Longitudinal Distance:** The longitudinal distance is |-2131.9388 - (-2109.5159)| = 22.4229 meters.

3. **Relative Velocity:** The obstacle is moving slightly faster than the ego vehicle (9.5438 vs. 9.5126). The relative longitudinal velocity is approximately 9.5438 - 9.5126 = 0.0312 m/s. This small positive value indicates that the longitudinal distance is shrinking, although very slowly. Note: lateral relative velocity analysis not performed here due to complexity, but is essential for a comprehensive analysis.

4. **TTC (Time to Collision):**
    * **Longitudinal TTC:** 22.4229 m / 0.0312 m/s ≈ 718.68 seconds. This very large TTC value suggests a low longitudinal collision risk in the immediate future.
    * **Lateral TTC:**  A precise lateral TTC calculation requires information about lateral velocities and accelerations, which is not provided. However, given the small lateral separation, any significant lateral movement by either vehicle could lead to a rapid decrease in lateral TTC and increase collision risk.

5. **MDC (Minimum Distance to Collision):** The current distance between the vehicles is sqrt((3.0751)^2 + (22.4229)^2) ≈ 22.63 meters. This distance is shrinking slowly. The MDC is difficult to determine precisely without detailed trajectory information but it is important to note that it's possible the minimum distance can be smaller than current distance due to the change of orientation. This assumes straight-line trajectories; realistic driving behaviors would incorporate steering changes, affecting these calculations.

6. **Risk Assessment:**

*At timestamp 0.9s*, there is no immediate collision. However, the relatively close lateral proximity, combined with the small but positive relative longitudinal velocity and changing orientations, suggests a potential risk of collision within the next few seconds if their relative positions and trajectories continue at the current rates. Due to lack of information at other timesteps, other risks are not considered in this summary.
