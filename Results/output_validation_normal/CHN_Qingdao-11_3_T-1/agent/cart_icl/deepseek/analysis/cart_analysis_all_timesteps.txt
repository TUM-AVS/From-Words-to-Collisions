### Analysis:

1. **Relative Motion and Trajectory**:  
   - The ego vehicle and obstacle (ID: 30702.0) are both in the same lanelet (181.0), indicating a potential for collision if their paths converge.  
   - The obstacle is ahead of the ego vehicle and moving in the same direction but decelerating faster than the ego vehicle.  

2. **Distance and Velocity**:  
   - At 0.9 seconds, the longitudinal distance between the ego and the obstacle is approximately **22.42m** (calculated as the Euclidean distance between (655.4534, -2131.9388) and (652.3783, -2109.5159)).  
   - The ego velocity is **9.5126 m/s**, while the obstacle velocity is **9.5438 m/s**. The relative velocity is **0.0312 m/s**, meaning the obstacle is moving slightly faster but the gap is closing very slowly.  

3. **Time to Collision (TTC)**:  
   - TTC = Distance / Relative Velocity = 22.42 / 0.0312 â‰ˆ **718.6 seconds** (very large, indicating no immediate risk).  

4. **Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC)**:  
   - Given the slow convergence and large initial distance, the MDC is not critical.  

5. **Risk Assessment**:  
   - The obstacle is not on an immediate collision course with the ego vehicle. The large TTC and sufficient lateral distance (same lanelet but no immediate overlap) suggest **low risk**.
