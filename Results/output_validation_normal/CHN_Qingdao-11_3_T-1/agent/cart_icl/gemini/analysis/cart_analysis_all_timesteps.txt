At t=0.9s, the ego vehicle and obstacle 30702 are in the same lanelet (181). The obstacle's x-coordinate is less than the ego's, indicating it's to the ego's right (given they share similar orientations near pi/2 radians).  Both are decelerating.

Lateral Distance at t=0.9s: approximately sqrt((655.4534-652.3783)^2 + (-2131.9388 - -2109.5159)^2) = 22.6 meters.
Longitudinal distance: Assuming the lanelet direction aligns with the Y-axis (given their orientations are approximately pi/2), the longitudinal distance at t=0.9s can be estimated by 2131.9388 - 2109.5159 = 22.42 meters.
The obstacle is positioned slightly to the right and behind the ego vehicle.

Velocity analysis reveals both are decelerating, but the obstacle is decelerating faster, therefore the relative velocity is small and likely to decrease.

Rough TTC estimation (using longitudinal data):
Relative longitudinal position: -22.4 meters
Relative longitudinal velocity: 9.51 - 9.54 = -0.03m/s (obstacle slightly slower)
TTC = -22.4 / -0.03 â‰ˆ 746 seconds (very large)


Given the lateral distance of 22.6 meters, the relatively similar velocities and decelerations, and the large positive TTC value, there is no immediate collision risk.
