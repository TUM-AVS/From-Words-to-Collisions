### Analysis:

In analyzing the motion of the Ego vehicle and obstacle 30702.0 at the most recent timestep (0.9 seconds), both vehicles are within the same lanelet and thus directly relevant to each other's risk assessment.

#### Position and Velocity Analysis:

- **Ego Position**: (655.4534, -2131.9388)
- **Obstacle Position**: (652.3783, -2109.5159)
- **Relative Position**: This translates to a longitudinal position of approximately 22.42 meters behind the Obstacle.

- **Ego Velocity**: 9.5126 m/s
- **Obstacle Velocity**: 9.5438 m/s
- **Relative Longitudinal Velocity**: -0.0312 m/s
  - This indicates that the ego vehicle is moving slower than the obstacle by a small margin. The obstacle is slightly outpacing the ego.

#### Risk Calculations:

**TTC (Time To Collision):**

- **Longitudinal TTC Calculation**: 
  Given that the ego is currently slower and behind, the situation is not leading to a collision unless one decelerates abruptly or lanes change. The TTC in the longitudinal dimension is not applicable directly due to lack of significant relative closing speed.

**MDC (Minimum Distance to Collision):**

- Currently, the lateral separation is significant as they share the same lanelet without a lateral position specified, indicating an approximate safe lateral distance usually in highway scenarios.
  
#### Overall Risk Assessment:

- **Position**: Safe separation maintained.
- **Velocity & Acceleration**: No significant threat due to small negative relative speed, indicating departure rather than an approach.
- **Trajectory Alignment**: Both objects are aligned in lanelet 181.0, indicating they are in the same lane. 

Based on this analysis, the risk of collision remains very low. However, continuous monitoring is advisable. At present, the calculated metrics do not indicate collision or extreme risk scenarios.
