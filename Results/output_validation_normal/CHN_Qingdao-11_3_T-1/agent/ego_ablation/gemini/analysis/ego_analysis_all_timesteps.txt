At t=0.9s, obstacle 30702 is moving away longitudinally from the ego vehicle at 0.01 m/s and laterally at 0.56 m/s.  The longitudinal distance is increasing, suggesting no immediate longitudinal collision risk. While the lateral distance is minimal (0.0m suggesting it's directly in front), the lateral velocity shows it is moving away from the ego vehicle's path. The relative acceleration also supports the obstacle's movement away from the ego vehicle. Given these factors, the obstacle poses no immediate collision risk.
