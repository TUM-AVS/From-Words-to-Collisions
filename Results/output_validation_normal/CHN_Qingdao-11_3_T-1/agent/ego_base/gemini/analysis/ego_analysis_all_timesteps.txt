At t=0.9s, obstacle 30702 is in front of the ego vehicle, moving longitudinally away at a slow rate (0.01 m/s) and laterally away at 0.56 m/s. The longitudinal distance is 18.10 m. While the lateral velocity suggests movement, the lateral distance remains at 0.00 m, indicating continued alignment with the ego vehicle's path. The relatively large longitudinal distance (18.10 m) and slow longitudinal relative velocity suggest low risk of collision in the immediate future. The lateral movement, though present, doesn't pose an immediate threat due to the current alignment and the relatively large longitudinal separation. Overall, the risk associated with this obstacle appears to be low.
