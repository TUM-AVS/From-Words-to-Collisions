### Safety analysis for timestep 0.9s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 30702
- Distance Risk reason: At 0.9 seconds, the obstacle is 18.10 meters longitudinally and 18.10 meters laterally away from the ego vehicle, positioned in front. These distances signify a substantial separation, indicating no immediate risk of collision.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: While the longitudinal relative velocity is minimal (0.01 m/s), suggesting near-zero longitudinal movement relative to the ego vehicle, the lateral relative velocity is 0.56 m/s, indicating lateral movement. Given the substantial lateral distance and the direction of movement away from the ego vehicle (to the left), the TTC suggests ample time to react and minimal collision risk. 
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5
