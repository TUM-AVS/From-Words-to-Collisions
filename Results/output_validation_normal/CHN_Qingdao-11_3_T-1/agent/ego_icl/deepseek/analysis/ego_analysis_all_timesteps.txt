### Obstacle Analysis: Obstacle 30702

#### Trajectory Analysis (0.1s to 0.9s):
- **Longitudinal Distance**: Increasing from 17.95m to 18.10m (moving away from ego).
- **Lateral Distance**: Decreasing from 0.49m to 0.00m (moving left, aligning with ego lane).
- **Relative Velocity**:
  - Longitudinal: Decreasing from 1.29 m/s to 0.01 m/s (moving away but slowing down).
  - Lateral: Decreasing from 2.08 m/s to 0.56 m/s (moving left but slowing down).
- **Motion Description**: Obstacle is moving away longitudinally and laterally to the left.

#### Most Recent Timestep (0.9s):
- **Adjusted Distance**: 
  - Longitudinal: 18.10 m (adjusted_d_long not provided, using raw distance).
  - Lateral: 0.00 m (adjusted_d_lat not provided, using raw distance).
- **Relative Velocity**: 
  - Longitudinal: 0.01 m/s (moving away very slowly).
  - Lateral: 0.56 m/s (moving left, but slowing down).
- **Motion**: Obstacle is moving away longitudinally and aligned laterally.

#### Risk Assessment:
1. **Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC)**:
   - Lateral distance is 0.00m (aligned), but longitudinal distance is 18.10m (very large).
   - MDC is effectively the longitudinal distance (18.10m), which is > 5.0m → **Risk 5 (Negligible)**.

2. **Time-to-Collision (TTC)**:
   - Longitudinal TTC: Distance / Relative Velocity = 18.10 / 0.01 = 1810s (not applicable, moving away).
   - Lateral TTC: Distance / Relative Velocity = 0.00 / 0.56 = 0s (but obstacle is moving away left, not converging).
   - TTC is not applicable (paths are diverging) → **Risk 5 (Negligible)**.

3. **Overall Risk**:
   - Both MDC and TTC indicate negligible risk (Risk 5).
   - No collision or extreme risk observed.
