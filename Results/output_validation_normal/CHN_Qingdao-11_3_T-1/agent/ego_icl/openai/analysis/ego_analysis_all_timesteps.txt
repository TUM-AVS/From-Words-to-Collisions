### Obstacle-by-Obstacle Analysis

#### Obstacle 30702:

1. **Trajectory Analysis** (based on past timesteps):
   - Over the timesteps from 0.0 to 0.9 seconds, it's observed that Obstacle 30702 is primarily moving away from the ego vehicle in both longitudinal and lateral directions.
   - The obstacle starts in the front-left direction and transitions to directly in front of the ego car, indicating a path heading away but with very close lateral proximity decreasing to 0.00 meters.

2. **Most Recent Timestep (0.9 seconds)**:
   - **Adjusted Longitudinal Distance**: 18.10 meters
   - **Adjusted Lateral Distance**: 0.00 meters
   - **Relative Longitudinal Velocity**: 0.01 m/s (approaching extremely slowly)
   - **Relative Lateral Velocity**: -0.56 m/s (moving away sideways)

3. **Time-to-Collision (TTC) and Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC)**:
   - **TTC (Longitudinal)**: Given the small approach velocity, TTC in the longitudinal direction is extremely high, indicating no imminent risk of collision in this direction.
   - **TTC (Lateral)**: The negative velocity indicates the obstacle is moving away laterally, further confirming no risk when combined with exact lateral alignment.
   - **MDC**: The lateral alignment (0.00m lateral) could suggest alignment risk in a lane where exact lateral is achieved, but the correctly moving away longitudinal trajectory and low approach velocity means this alignment is not risky since longitudinal distance is stable and sufficient.

4. **Risk Assessment**:
   - **Longitudinal Analysis**: No real approach; the obstacle is maintaining a safe distance and slightly moving away, eliminating collision risk in the longitudinal direction.
   - **Lateral Analysis**: Although exactly aligned laterally, relative motion indicates the obstacle trajectory is diverging.
   - **Risk Score Determination**: Given the stable/improving longitudinal distance and no closing risk laterally, the overall risk based on distance and velocities is negligible in terms of collision.

### JSON Summary

The obstacle overall does not present any immediate or potential high-risk collision scenario primarily due to the stable longitudinal distances and effective lateral alignment without convergence risk.

In conclusion, for Obstacle 30702, both the lateral alignment and relative directional motion illustrate that the path continues to diverge, and the collision risk remains negligible over the analyzed timeframe.
