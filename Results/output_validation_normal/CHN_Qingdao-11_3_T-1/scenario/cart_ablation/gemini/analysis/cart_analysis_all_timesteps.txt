At t=0.9s, the ego vehicle at (655.4534, -2131.9388) and the obstacle 30702.0 at (652.3783, -2109.5159) are in the same lanelet.  The lateral distance is small and decreasing. Both vehicles are decelerating but not quickly enough to avoid a likely collision in the next few timesteps given their current velocities and closing distance. The velocity difference is also minimal.  Therefore, this is considered an extreme risk scenario.

        "Reasoning": "Obstacle 30702.0 poses an extreme risk due to decreasing inter-vehicle distance and current velocities indicating likely collision in near future."
