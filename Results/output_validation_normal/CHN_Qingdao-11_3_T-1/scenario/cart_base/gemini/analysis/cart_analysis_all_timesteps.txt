At t=0.9s, the ego vehicle at (655.4534, -2131.9388) and the obstacle (30702.0) at (652.3783, -2109.5159) are in the same lanelet (181.0).  The lateral distance is small and decreasing based on the trajectories. Both vehicles are decelerating, but the obstacle's deceleration is much greater than the ego's.  Given the closing distance and velocity difference, an extreme risk of collision exists.
