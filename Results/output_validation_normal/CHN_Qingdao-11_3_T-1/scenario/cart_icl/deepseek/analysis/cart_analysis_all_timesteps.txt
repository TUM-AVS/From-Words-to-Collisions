### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep (0.9 seconds):

### Obstacle Analysis:
- **Obstacle ID**: 30702.0
  - **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is in the same lanelet (181.0) as the ego vehicle. Over the past 9 timesteps, the distance between the ego and the obstacle has been decreasing (from ~23.8m to ~22.4m). The obstacle is ahead of the ego but moving slower (9.54 m/s vs. 9.51 m/s). The lateral distance is negligible (same lanelet).
  - **Distance safety score**: 2 (High Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: The relative velocity is small (0.03 m/s), and both vehicles are decelerating (obstacle: -6.26 m/s², ego: -2.30 m/s²). The time to collision (TTC) is high (~746 seconds), but the trend shows the obstacle is slowing faster than the ego.
  - **Time safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 2 (High Risk)

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. **Same Lanelet**: Both ego and obstacle are in lanelet 181.0, indicating shared trajectory.
2. **Distance Trend**: Distance is decreasing but remains significant (~22.4m).
3. **Velocity/Acceleration**: Obstacle is decelerating faster than ego, reducing collision risk.
4. **TTC**: Very high TTC suggests no immediate collision risk, but the trend requires monitoring.
5. **Conclusion**: No imminent collision, but high risk due to proximity and deceleration mismatch.
