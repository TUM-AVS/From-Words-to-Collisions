### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
No obstacle poses an immediate collision risk to the ego vehicle.  The ego vehicle is moving south, and most other obstacles are further east and moving away. Obstacle 30702 is in the same lane and behind the ego vehicle and decelerating, representing no immediate risk. This is not a collision scenario.
