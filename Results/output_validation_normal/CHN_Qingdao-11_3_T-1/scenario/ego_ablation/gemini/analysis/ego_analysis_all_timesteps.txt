Obstacle 30702 is moving away longitudinally from the ego vehicle, and although it shows exact lateral alignment at the most recent timestep (0.9 seconds), its lateral velocity indicates it is moving away to the left.  The longitudinal distance is increasing, and the lateral movement suggests diverging paths.  The relative velocity and acceleration support this assessment. Therefore, the risk of collision is negligible.
