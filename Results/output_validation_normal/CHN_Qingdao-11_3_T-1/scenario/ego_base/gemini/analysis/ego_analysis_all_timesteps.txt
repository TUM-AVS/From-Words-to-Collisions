Obstacle 30702 is moving away longitudinally from the ego vehicle at a slow relative longitudinal velocity of 0.01 m/s.  While it is laterally aligned with the ego vehicle (lateral distance 0.00 m), it maintains a lateral velocity of 0.56 m/s, suggesting continued lateral movement. The lateral acceleration is -3.90 m/sÂ², indicating a deceleration in the lateral direction, but this might not be enough to prevent a potential risk in subsequent timesteps if the ego vehicle also maintains its current course. Though not an immediate collision risk, continued monitoring is necessary.
