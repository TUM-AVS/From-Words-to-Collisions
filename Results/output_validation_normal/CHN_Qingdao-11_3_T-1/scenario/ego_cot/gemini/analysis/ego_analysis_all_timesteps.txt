### Safety analysis for timestep 0.9 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 30702
- Distance Risk reason: At 0.9 seconds, Obstacle 30702 is 18.10m longitudinally and 18.10m laterally away from the ego vehicle, in the front. These distances are significant and suggest no immediate risk. The obstacle is moving away longitudinally and its lateral movement, while towards the ego vehicle's path (exact lateral alignment), is minimal.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Given the increasing distances and the direction of movement (moving away both longitudinally and laterally by the last timestep), the TTC is likely very high, indicating a low risk of collision.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5
