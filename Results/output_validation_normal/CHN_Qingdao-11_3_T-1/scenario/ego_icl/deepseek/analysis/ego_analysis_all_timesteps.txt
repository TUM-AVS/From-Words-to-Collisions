### Obstacle-by-Obstacle Analysis (Most Recent Timestep: 0.9 seconds)

#### Obstacle 30702:
- **Direction**: Front of the ego car
- **Adjusted Distances**: 
  - Longitudinal: 18.10 m (raw distance, adjusted distance not provided, assuming similar)
  - Lateral: 0.00 m (exact alignment)
- **Relative Velocity**: 
  - Longitudinal: 0.01 m/s (moving away very slowly)
  - Lateral: 0.56 m/s (moving away laterally to the left)
- **Relative Acceleration**: 
  - Longitudinal: 0.74 m/s² (positive, increasing longitudinal separation)
  - Lateral: -3.90 m/s² (negative, decelerating lateral movement)
- **Motion Description**: 
  - Obstacle is moving away longitudinally.
  - Exact lateral alignment or unknown case.

#### Trajectory Analysis:
- Over the timesteps (0.1s to 0.9s), the obstacle is consistently moving away longitudinally (distance increasing from 17.95m to 18.10m).
- Laterally, the obstacle moves from 0.49m (left) to 0.00m (aligned) but is moving away to the left (lateral velocity is positive, indicating leftward movement away from ego).
- The lateral distance is decreasing but the obstacle is moving away, so no immediate collision risk.

#### TTC Calculation:
- **Longitudinal TTC**: 
  - Distance: 18.10 m
  - Relative Velocity: 0.01 m/s (moving away, so TTC is not applicable for collision risk).
- **Lateral TTC**: 
  - Distance: 0.00 m (but moving away at 0.56 m/s, so no collision risk).
  - TTC is not applicable since the obstacle is moving away.

#### MDC Calculation:
- The obstacle is longitudinally aligned (lateral distance = 0.00m) but moving away both longitudinally and laterally.
- The closest distance (MDC) is the lateral distance: 0.00m, but since the obstacle is moving away, this does not indicate a collision risk.

#### Risk Assessment:
- **Longitudinal Risk**: No Risk (5) - Moving away.
- **Lateral Risk**: No Risk (5) - Moving away.
- **Overall Risk**: No Risk (5) - No converging trajectories.

### Conclusion:
- No collision or extreme risk is observed for Obstacle 30702.
- The obstacle is moving away from the ego vehicle in both longitudinal and lateral directions, with no indication of converging paths.
