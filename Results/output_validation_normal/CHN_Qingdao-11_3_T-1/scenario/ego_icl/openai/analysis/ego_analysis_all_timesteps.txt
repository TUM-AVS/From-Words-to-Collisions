## Obstacle-by-Obstacle Analysis:

### Obstacle 30702 Analysis:
- **Trajectory Analysis**:
  - The obstacle started from a front-left position at the ego car, with a lateral distance decreasing monotonically. Ultimately this results in an alignment position where the lateral distance reaches 0.00m by 0.5 seconds. The longitudinal distance stabilized around 18.10 – 18.18m, indicating the obstacle is moving away longitudinally.
  
- **Current Timestep (0.9 seconds)**:
  - **Position**: Front of the ego car.
  - **Adjusted Distances**: Longitudinal ≈ 18.10 m, Lateral = 0.00 m.
  - **Relative Velocities**: Longitudinal = 0.01 m/s (away), Lateral = 0.56 m/s (away).
  - **Relative Accelerations**: Longitudinal = 0.74 m/s² (away), Lateral = -3.90 m/s² (to the left).

- **MDC and TTC Calculations**:
  - **MDC**:
    - Lateral distance is critical here due to the frontal alignment.
    - MDC = 0.00 m (lateral), given continued longitudinal clearance.
  - **TTC**:
    - Given lateral velocity = 0.56 m/s (away) and longitudinal velocity close to 0 m/s, TTC isn't reasonably calculable because the obstacle is not converging.
  
- **Risk Assessment**:
  - **Collision Alignment**: Lateral distance is 0.00 meters.
  - **Risk Scores**:
    - **MDC** implies potential collision risk (0), but as there's lateral moving away, it's unlikely under the trajectory information.
    - **Longevity** of stable longitudinal distances and lateral velocities indicates no immediate concern.
    - Pure motion description notes longitudinal moving away and lateral moving away, preventing collision.

## Conclusion:

Given the overall analysis, there is no collision as:
- The longitudinal distance is not directly converging, and the lateral path is explicitly diverging.
- The alignment on a longitudinal scale helps to maintain a safe trajectory due to increased longitudinal distance and no direct lateral intervention.

Thus, this scenario is not a collision scenario.
