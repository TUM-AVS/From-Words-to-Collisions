Obstacle 30746 shows a concerning trend.  It starts relatively far from the ego vehicle but its trajectory seems to be converging with the ego vehicle's path.  While not an immediate collision, the continuous decrease in lateral distance combined with its fluctuating acceleration requires close monitoring as it represents a potential high risk in the near future.

Obstacle 30745 maintains a relatively constant lateral distance to the ego vehicle, posing no immediate threat.

Obstacle 30750 is moving away from the ego vehicle and does not appear to pose a risk.
