Obstacle 30746 shows a concerning trend.  Its lateral position (y-coordinate) is very close to the ego vehicle, and although initially moving slightly faster, its acceleration fluctuates considerably. This makes its future trajectory somewhat unpredictable and increases the risk of a collision, particularly given the ego vehicle's deceleration.  The closest lateral distance between ego and obstacle 30746 is observed at t=0.1s, with a difference of approximately 2.35 meters.  This gap closes to around 1.28 meters by t=0.9s.  While not an immediate collision, the closing distance and uncertain future trajectory of 30746 warrants classifying it as a High Risk.

Obstacle 30745 maintains a lateral distance of about 25-30 meters from the ego vehicle throughout the observed timeframe.  Its fluctuating acceleration is less concerning given this greater separation. This suggests the obstacle is less likely to be a collision threat.

Obstacle 30750 is consistently farther away from the ego vehicle in both lateral and longitudinal directions than the other obstacles, posing the lowest risk of the three. Its higher velocity does not translate to increased risk due to the safe separation.
