At t=0.9s, the ego vehicle is at (649.989, -1812.4347) with a velocity of 2.316. Let's analyze the risk posed by each obstacle:

**Obstacle 30745.0:** Located at (678.6512, -1813.1602) with a velocity of 2.1338.  This obstacle is significantly to the right and slightly behind the ego vehicle. The x-difference is about 28.7 meters and the y-difference is about 0.7 meters.  Although the obstacle is moving slower than the ego vehicle, given its trajectory from previous timestamps and the relatively close proximity in the y-coordinate, a medium risk assessment is appropriate.

**Obstacle 30746.0:** Located at (659.5944, -1811.9196) with a velocity of 2.5129. This obstacle is almost directly ahead of the ego vehicle and moving slightly faster. The x-difference is about 9.6 meters and the y-difference is approximately 0.5 meters.  Given the small distance between the two vehicles, the faster velocity of the obstacle, and observed acceleration pattern, this situation presents a high risk.

**Obstacle 30750.0:**  Located at (664.7604, -1808.9007) with a velocity of 4.6252. This obstacle is ahead and to the left of the ego vehicle, but considerably further away than the other two obstacles. The x-difference is about 14.8 meters, and the y-difference is approximately 3.5 meters.  Given the larger spatial separation and its oblique trajectory relative to the ego vehicle's path, this obstacle poses the lowest risk among the three.
