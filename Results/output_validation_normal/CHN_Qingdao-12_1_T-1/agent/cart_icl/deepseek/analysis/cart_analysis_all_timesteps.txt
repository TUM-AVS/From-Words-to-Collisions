### Analysis:

1. **Obstacle 30746**: 
   - **Position**: (659.5944, -1811.9196) at 0.9s, moving towards the ego vehicle.
   - **Relative Motion**: The obstacle is in the same lanelet (251.0) as the ego vehicle (1082.0 is adjacent or nearby). The lateral distance is significant, but the longitudinal distance is closing.
   - **TTC**: The relative velocity is ~0.2 m/s (ego: 2.316 m/s, obstacle: 2.5129 m/s). The distance is ~10m, so TTC is ~50s. **Low Risk (4)**.
   - **MDC**: The lateral separation is large enough to avoid collision.

2. **Obstacle 30750**: 
   - **Position**: (664.7604, -1808.9007) at 0.9s, moving away from the ego vehicle.
   - **Relative Motion**: The obstacle is in lanelet 250.0, which is likely adjacent to the ego's lanelet. The longitudinal distance is increasing (ego is at ~649.989, obstacle at ~664.7604).
   - **TTC**: The relative velocity is ~2.3 m/s (ego: 2.316 m/s, obstacle: 4.6252 m/s). The distance is ~15m, so TTC is ~6.5s. **Negligible Risk (5)**.
   - **MDC**: The lateral separation is sufficient to avoid collision.

3. **Obstacle 30745**: 
   - **Position**: (678.6512, -1813.1602) at 0.9s, moving away from the ego vehicle.
   - **Relative Motion**: The obstacle is in lanelet 251.0, which is likely adjacent to the ego's lanelet. The longitudinal distance is large (~28m) and increasing.
   - **TTC**: The relative velocity is ~0.2 m/s (ego: 2.316 m/s, obstacle: 2.1338 m/s). The distance is ~28m, so TTC is ~140s. **Negligible Risk (5)**.
   - **MDC**: The lateral separation is sufficient to avoid collision.
