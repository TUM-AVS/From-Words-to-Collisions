At t=0.9s, the ego vehicle at (649.989, -1812.4347) is moving with a velocity of 2.316 and acceleration of -0.0236.  Let's analyze each obstacle:

* **Obstacle 30745:** Located at (678.6512, -1813.1602), it's moving with a velocity of 2.1338 and acceleration of 1.9578. This obstacle is laterally offset and far from the ego vehicle and poses no immediate threat.  Although it has a higher acceleration than the ego vehicle, the current trajectories do not indicate a collision course. Risk: **Negligible (5)**

* **Obstacle 30746:** Located at (659.5944, -1811.9196), it's moving with a velocity of 2.5129 and an acceleration of 1.5271.  This obstacle is closer to the ego vehicle and in a similar Y coordinate but with a higher X value and velocity. It appears to be moving faster than the ego vehicle, but not rapidly closing in, however, the Y coordinate values suggest a lane change might have happened. Risk: **Medium (3)**

* **Obstacle 30750:** Located at (664.7604, -1808.9007), it's moving with a velocity of 4.6252 and an acceleration of -1.0839. This obstacle is farther from the ego vehicle, and although its velocity is significantly higher, it does not pose an immediate risk.  The substantial lateral offset mitigates any collision potential in the short term.  Risk: **Low (4)**
