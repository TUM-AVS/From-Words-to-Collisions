In the provided scenario, I have evaluated the motion of the ego vehicle and the obstacles at the most recent timestamp (0.9 seconds). Below is the analysis for each obstacle:

### Detailed Evaluation:
1. **Obstacle 30745.0**:
   - **Relative Position**: The distance between the ego and the obstacle is approximately 28.66 meters in the longitudinal direction. They are roughly in parallel lanes (lateral distance exceeds typical lane width).
   - **Relative Velocity**: The velocity difference is small since both are traveling in nearly parallel directions.
   - **TTC Calculation** is not critical since they are not directly aligned within the same lane, and is moving away laterally.
   - **MDC**: With a significant lateral distance, no immediate collision risk is apparent.
   - **Risk Assessment**: Negligible risk.

2. **Obstacle 30746.0**:
   - **Relative Position**: The closest distance is about 10 meters longitudinally, and the lateral distance is approximately 2 meters. Obstacle and ego are in adjacent lanes.
   - **Relative Velocity**: Increase in relative velocity with the obstacle accelerating towards the Ego.
   - **TTC Calculation**: The relative closing speed is minor given the slight difference in velocities.
   - **MDC**: Sufficient lateral distance assures low risk of collision.
   - **Risk Assessment**: Low risk (4)

3. **Obstacle 30750.0**:
   - **Relative Position**: Roughly 15 meters ahead longitudinally. Positioned well into a different lane.
   - **Relative Velocity**: Significantly faster but positioned laterally more than one lane apart.
   - **TTC Calculation**: Considerable lateral distance and different laneel prevents immediate collision risk.
   - **MDC**: No significant proximity concerns.
   - **Risk Assessment**: Negligible risk.

### Summary:
None of the observed obstacles pose a serious collision threat to the ego vehicle within the present dynamics and positional relations.

### Valid JSON Output:

```json
{
    "CollisionObstacles": [],
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null,
    "HighRiskObstacle": null
}
```

In this analysis, no obstacles required a categorization of high risk or above. All present dynamics demonstrated adequate safety buffers in terms of time and distance for collision avoidance.
