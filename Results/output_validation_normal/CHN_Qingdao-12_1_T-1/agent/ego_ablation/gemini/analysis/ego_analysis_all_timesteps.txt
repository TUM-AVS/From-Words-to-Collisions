At t=0.9s, obstacle 30746 poses a high risk due to its proximity to the ego vehicle.  It is located 2.90m longitudinally and -4.53m laterally, indicating it is quite close and slightly to the right of the ego vehicle's front. While it's moving away laterally at -1.92 m/s, its longitudinal velocity of -0.69 m/s shows it's still approaching the ego vehicle. The data suggests that obstacle 30746 is the only high-risk obstacle at this timestep. The other obstacles are farther away and moving in directions that present a much lower risk of collision in the immediate future.
