### Safety analysis for timestep 0.9s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

**Assumptions and Clarifications:**

* **Missing Adjusted Distances:** The prompt emphasizes using *adjusted* distances (`adjusted_d_long`, `adjusted_d_lat`). However, these values are *not provided* in the scenario context.  Therefore, the analysis will proceed using the provided `real distance` values (`DTClong`, `DTClat`) as a proxy. This is a significant limitation, and the results might be inaccurate.  A proper analysis requires the adjusted distances.
* **TTC Calculation:**  TTC will be calculated based on the provided longitudinal and lateral velocities. If `Vrel_long` is positive (obstacle moving away), TTClong will be considered infinity. Similarly, if `Vrel_lat` is positive (obstacle moving away laterally), TTClat will be considered infinity.
* **Lack of Ego Vehicle Information:** The analysis lacks ego vehicle dimensions and speed. These are crucial for precise TTC and MDC calculations.  
* **Motion Prediction:** The provided motion descriptions are helpful but don't provide the level of detail needed for accurate prediction.

**Calculations and Analysis:**

**Obstacle 30745:**

* Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is at 16.05m longitudinally and laterally, considered far and moving away laterally.
* Distance safety score: 5
* Time Risk reason: Moving slightly towards the ego vehicle longitudinally, but far away.
* Time safety score: 4
* Overall Risk score: 4

**Obstacle 30746:**

* Distance Risk reason: Very close proximity to the ego car (2.90m) both longitudinally and laterally.
* Distance safety score: 2
* Time Risk reason: Moving toward the ego vehicle longitudinally and slightly moving away laterally, indicating a high risk.
* Time safety score: 2
* Overall Risk score: 2

**Obstacle 30750:**

* Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is at 8.74m longitudinally and laterally and moving away.
* Distance safety score: 4
* Time Risk reason: Moving away longitudinally, and moving away laterally indicating no collision risk.
* Time safety score: 5
* Overall Risk score: 5
