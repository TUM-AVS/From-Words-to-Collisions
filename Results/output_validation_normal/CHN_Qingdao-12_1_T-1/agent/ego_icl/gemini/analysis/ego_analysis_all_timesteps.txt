Obstacle 30745:
- Trajectory: This obstacle has been consistently in the front-right of the ego vehicle, moving slightly closer longitudinally while moving further away laterally.  The longitudinal distance has fluctuated a bit across timesteps.
- At t=0.9s:  Longitudinal distance is 16.05m, lateral distance is -18.38m, longitudinal velocity is -0.26 m/s (towards ego), and lateral velocity is -0.56 m/s (away from ego).
- TTC Longitudinal: 16.05m / 0.26 m/s = 61.73s  (Not a concern as moving very slowly).
- TTC Lateral:  N/A, moving away.
- MDC: Due to the large lateral distance and the fact that the obstacle is moving away laterally, the MDC is large.
- Risk: 5 (Negligible Risk)

Obstacle 30746:
- Trajectory: This obstacle has been consistently in the front-right and has been the closest obstacle throughout the provided timesteps. It is approaching the ego vehicle longitudinally while moving away laterally, but the lateral movement is less pronounced than Obstacle 30745.
- At t=0.9s: Longitudinal distance is 2.90m, lateral distance is -4.53m, longitudinal velocity is -0.69 m/s (towards ego), and lateral velocity is -1.92 m/s (away from ego).
- TTC Longitudinal: 2.90m / 0.69m/s = 4.20s
- TTC Lateral: N/A, moving away.
- MDC: While the lateral distance is decreasing, it's doing so relatively slowly, and the primary concern is the longitudinal distance.  An MDC of approximately 2.90m is a reasonable estimate.
- Risk: 4 (Low Risk) - Primarily due to the longitudinal proximity, although the lateral movement reduces the overall risk.

Obstacle 30750:
- Trajectory: This obstacle has been in the front-right, initially moving away longitudinally then moving closer to the ego vehicle, while consistently moving away laterally.
- At t=0.9s: Longitudinal distance is 8.74m, lateral distance is -5.82m, longitudinal velocity is 0.69 m/s (away from ego) and lateral velocity is -3.51 m/s (away from ego).
- TTC Longitudinal: Not applicable as moving apart.
- TTC Lateral: Not applicable as moving apart.
- MDC:  The obstacle is moving away in both directions. MDC is therefore large.
- Risk: 5 (Negligible risk)
