At t=0.9s, Ego is at (649.989, -1812.4347) in lanelet 1082.0.

Obstacle 30745.0 is at (678.6512, -1813.1602) in lanelet 251.0.  While the y-coordinates are close, the x-coordinate difference is significant (~28.7m), suggesting no immediate collision risk. The obstacle's velocity is increasing, but not drastically.  Given the trajectory and current separation, this is likely a low risk.

Obstacle 30746.0 is at (659.5944, -1811.9196) in lanelet 251.0.  The x-coordinate difference is around 9.6m, and the y-coordinate difference is small. The obstacle is moving with a velocity of 2.5129 and increasing acceleration. This proximity and approaching trajectory represent a potential risk, requiring further analysis with future timesteps to determine if evasive action might be necessary.  However, at this moment, it's not an *extreme* risk.

Obstacle 30750.0 is at (664.7604, -1808.9007) in lanelet 250.0. The distances are larger than with obstacle 30746.0 and this obstacle appears less concerning.

Therefore, no obstacle presents an extreme or collision risk at t=0.9s.
