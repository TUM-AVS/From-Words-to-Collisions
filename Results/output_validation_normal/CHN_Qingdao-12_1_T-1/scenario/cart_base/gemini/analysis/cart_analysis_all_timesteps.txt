At t=0.9s, Ego is at (649.989, -1812.4347) in lanelet 1082.0.

Obstacle 30745.0 is at (678.6512, -1813.1602) in lanelet 251.0.  While the y-coordinates are close, the x-coordinates are significantly different, suggesting no immediate collision risk.  The trajectory history shows this obstacle accelerating towards the Ego vehicle, but not at a rate suggesting extreme risk in the immediate next timestep.

Obstacle 30746.0 is at (659.5944, -1811.9196) in lanelet 251.0.  This obstacle is relatively close to the Ego vehicle in both x and y coordinates. Examining the trajectory, this obstacle appears to be on a course that could lead to a collision or near miss soon, representing a potential extreme risk.

Obstacle 30750.0 is at (664.7604, -1808.9007) in lanelet 250.0. While this obstacle's x-coordinate puts it in a similar longitudinal position as the ego vehicle, the y-coordinate suggests they are not in immediately close proximity. Its trajectory history shows it decelerating, further reducing immediate risk.
