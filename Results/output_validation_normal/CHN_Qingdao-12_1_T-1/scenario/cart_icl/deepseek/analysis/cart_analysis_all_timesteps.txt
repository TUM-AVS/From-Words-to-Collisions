### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep (0.9 seconds):

### Obstacle Analysis:

#### Obstacle ID: 30745.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is far from the ego vehicle (distance ~28.66m) and moving away (positive acceleration). No immediate threat.
- **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- **Time Risk reason**: High relative distance and diverging trajectories. TTC is effectively infinite.
- **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- **Overall Risk score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)

#### Obstacle ID: 30746.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: Distance is decreasing (~9.6m) but still moderate. Orientation suggests crossing path.
- **Distance safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk)
- **Time Risk reason**: Relative velocity is low (ego: 2.316m/s, obstacle: 2.5129m/s). TTC ~9.6/0.2 ≈ 48s.
- **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
- **Overall Risk score**: 3 (Medium Risk)

#### Obstacle ID: 30750.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: Distance is ~14.8m but closing rapidly (high velocity 4.6252m/s vs ego 2.316m/s).
- **Distance safety score**: 2 (High Risk)
- **Time Risk reason**: Relative velocity ~2.3m/s → TTC ~14.8/2.3 ≈ 6.4s. Accelerating towards ego.
- **Time safety score**: 2 (High Risk)
- **Overall Risk score**: 2 (High Risk)

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. Ego is in lanelet 1082.0, obstacles are in lanelets 250.0/251.0 (adjacent lanes).
2. Obstacle 30750.0 shows the highest risk due to high velocity and closing distance.
3. No obstacles are in immediate collision course (TTC > 5s for all).
4. Scenario requires monitoring but no urgent evasive action needed.
