### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 30741.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is far from ego vehicle and not approaching.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Obstacle is stationary.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 30745.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is moderately close to ego vehicle, but lateral separation and differing lanelets suggest low immediate risk.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason:  Obstacle's velocity is increasing, but its trajectory appears to be diverging from the ego vehicle.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- Obstacle ID: 30746.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is closest to ego vehicle, raising concern.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: Obstacle's velocity is close to ego vehicle, but its acceleration is fluctuating and its trajectory does not appear to intersect with ego vehicle.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3

- Obstacle ID: 30750.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is moderately far from ego vehicle.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Although obstacle has high velocity, it's decelerating and in a different lanelet, indicating low immediate risk.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4


### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
By analyzing the provided data, we can observe that no obstacle poses an immediate collision risk to the ego vehicle. All obstacles are either in different lanelets or maintain sufficient separation, and their trajectories do not appear to directly intersect with the ego vehicle's path in the immediate future. Therefore, it is not a collision scenario.
