### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep

### Obstacle Analysis

#### Obstacle ID: 30741.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle remains stationary at (684.9449, -1815.5389) throughout the time period, suggesting it is not on a collision path with the moving ego vehicle.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: The lack of velocity and acceleration indicates no change over time, posing no collision threat.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 30745.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is moving slightly away from the ego car's trajectory and has been consistently moving southwest, decreasing potential collision risk.
- **Distance safety score**: 4 
- **Time Risk reason**: Increasing velocity, but moving away from Ego's trajectory with no significant acceleration trends that would increase collision risk.
- **Time safety score**: 4
- **Overall Risk score**: 4

#### Obstacle ID: 30746.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle consistently moves slightly north of the Ego vehicle's path. While velocities are similar, predicted future paths indicate minimal collision risk.
- **Distance safety score**: 4
- **Time Risk reason**: Steady velocity with minor positive acceleration implies no abrupt movement into the Ego vehicle path.
- **Time safety score**: 4
- **Overall Risk score**: 4

#### Obstacle ID: 30750.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is farther along the path (north-east) of the Ego's predicted path but is still moving farther away. Its higher velocity decreases the potential encounter.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: Despite its high velocity, the obstacle continues to decelerate, reducing the risk of future proximity.
- **Time safety score**: 4
- **Overall Risk score**: 4.5

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis
- Analyzed all obstacle trajectories with respect to ego vehicle position and speed.
- Ego vehicle continues onward with slight south-west trajectory change.
- No obstacles cross into Ego's direct path.
- Results show all obstacles either stationary, slowing, or diverging.
- Based on the analysis, there is no immediate risk of collision.
