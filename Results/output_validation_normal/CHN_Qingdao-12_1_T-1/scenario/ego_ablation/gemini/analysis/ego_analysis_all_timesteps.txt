Obstacle 30746 is the closest obstacle, at a longitudinal distance of 2.90m. While it's moving away laterally, its longitudinal velocity suggests it's still approaching the ego vehicle.  This poses a high risk. Other obstacles are further away and moving away from the ego vehicle, posing less immediate risk.
