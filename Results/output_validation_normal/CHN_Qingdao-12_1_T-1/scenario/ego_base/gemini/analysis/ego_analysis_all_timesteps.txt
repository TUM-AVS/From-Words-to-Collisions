At t=0.9s, Obstacle 30746 is closest to the ego vehicle with a longitudinal distance of 2.90m and moving towards the ego car longitudinally at -0.69 m/s.  While this is close, it's not an immediate collision. All obstacles are moving away laterally to the right, decreasing lateral collision risk. No collision is imminent in the next timestep.

**Risk Levels and Definitions:**
<Collision (Score: 0)>: Actual collision has occurred or is unavoidable within the next timestep.
<Extreme Risk (Score: 1)>: Immediate collision or very high likelihood of impact. Urgent action is required.
<High Risk (Score: 2)>: Close to collision or highly probable collision path. Needs prompt attention and quick manoeuvring.
<Medium Risk (Score: 3)>: Moderate collision risk but manageable with timely reactions and proper strategies.
<Low Risk (Score: 4)>: Minimal collision risk. The situation is controllable with sufficient time to react.
<Negligible Risk (Score: 5)>: No significant collision risk. Obstacles are either moving away or far enough not to interfere.
