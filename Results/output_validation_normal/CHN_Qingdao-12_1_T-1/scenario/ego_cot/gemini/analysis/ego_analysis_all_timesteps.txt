### Safety analysis for timestep 0.9 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

**Assumptions and Clarifications:**

* Since "adjusted distances" are explicitly requested but not provided in the scenario context, the provided `real distance` values (DTClong and DTClat) will be used for this analysis.  This is not ideal and a true safety assessment requires accurate adjusted distances.  I will flag instances where having the adjusted distances would be crucial for a correct assessment.
* TTC will be approximated using a simplified calculation: `TTC = Distance / Relative Velocity`. This assumes constant velocity, which isn't realistic but provides a first-order approximation.  A more robust analysis would require considering acceleration and predicting future trajectories.  If the relative velocity is zero or moves away from the ego vehicle, TTC will be considered infinity (no collision risk).
* A combined distance and TTC approach will be used to determine the overall risk score.


### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 30745**
- Distance Risk reason:  Located at 16.05m longitudinally and laterally in the front-right.  This represents a relatively safe distance.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason:  This obstacle is approaching longitudinally (-0.26 m/s) although moving away laterally. The simplified TTC calculation isn't meaningful given the low velocity and the likely inaccuracies. More data points and adjusted distances are needed for a precise TTC estimation. However, the slow approach suggests ample time to react.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 30746**
- Distance Risk reason: Located at 2.90m longitudinally and laterally in the front-right. This is very close, presenting a high risk.  *Adjusted distances are crucial here*.  If the adjusted distance is significantly smaller, a collision could be imminent.
- Distance safety score: 2
- Time Risk reason: Approaching longitudinally (-0.69 m/s) and moving away laterally. The close proximity combined with approaching motion makes this obstacle a high risk.  The simplified TTC calculation suggests a collision risk within a few seconds (2.90m / 0.69m/s â‰ˆ 4.2s), but this is a very rough estimate. Accurate TTC would require accounting for the vehicle dimensions (adjusted distances) and accelerations.
- Time safety score: 2
- Overall Risk score: 2

- **Obstacle ID: 30750**
- Distance Risk reason: Located at 8.74m longitudinally and laterally in the front-right.  This represents a moderately safe distance.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Moving *away* longitudinally (0.69 m/s) and laterally.  No collision risk longitudinally.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 4



### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
    "CollisionObstacle": null,
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null,
    "IsCollisionScenario": false,
    "Justification": "While Obstacle 30746 presents a high risk due to proximity, there is no imminent collision indicated within the predicted timeframe of the provided data (0.9 seconds). More data, especially adjusted distances, is needed for a definitive assessment. All other obstacles are assessed as medium to low risk."
