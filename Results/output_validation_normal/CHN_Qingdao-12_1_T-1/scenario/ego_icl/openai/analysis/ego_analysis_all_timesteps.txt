To analyze the collision risks of the scenario, let's calculate the risk for each obstacle at the most recent timestep (0.9 seconds) while considering their trajectories over the previous timesteps.

### Obstacle Analysis

#### Obstacle 30745
- **Position at 0.9s**: Longitudinal 16.05m, Lateral -18.38m
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal -0.26 m/s, Lateral -0.56 m/s
- **Motion**: Driving towards ego car longitudinally, moving away laterally
- **Trajectory Analysis**: Longitudinal distance increased from past timesteps, lateral distance oscillated slightly but mostly stabilized.
- **TTC Calculations**: 
  - Longitudinal: Not applicable as relative velocity suggests slight moving away longitudinally.
  - Lateral: TTC = 18.38 / |-0.56| = 32.82s 
- **MDC**: As the obstacle is moving away laterally and longitudinally increasing, MDC exceeds safety thresholds. 
- **Risk Assessment**: With TTC > 5s in both dimensions and increasing longitudinal distance, there is No Risk (5).

#### Obstacle 30746
- **Position at 0.9s**: Longitudinal 2.90m, Lateral -4.53m
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal -0.69 m/s, Lateral -1.92 m/s
- **Motion**: Driving towards ego car longitudinally, moving away laterally
- **Trajectory Analysis**: The longitudinal distance has decreased slightly over the timesteps, while the lateral distance increased.
- **TTC Calculations**: 
  - Longitudinal: TTC = 2.90 / |-0.69| = 4.20s
  - Lateral: TTC = 4.53 / |-1.92| = 2.36s
- **MDC**: Given the decreasing longitudinal and lateral paths converging slightly, MDC is concerning but still more than 1m at 0.9s.
- **Risk Assessment**: Medium Risk (3) due to the lateral TTC being < 3 seconds, although their paths appear to diverge due to lateral motion descriptions.

#### Obstacle 30750
- **Position at 0.9s**: Longitudinal 8.74m, Lateral -5.82m
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal 0.69 m/s, Lateral -3.51 m/s
- **Motion**: Moving away longitudinally, moving away laterally
- **Trajectory Analysis**: Consistent increase in both longitudinal distance as velocity directed away and consistent decrease in lateral distance but not critically reducing.
- **TTC Calculations**: 
  - Longitudinal: Not applicable as moving away.
  - Lateral: TTC = 5.82 / |-3.51| = 1.66s
- **MDC**: Their lateral and longitudinal movement both suggest diverging paths without imminent collision.
- **Risk Assessment**: Medium Risk (3) as the lateral TTC < 3 seconds.

### Concluding Analysis

Overall, none of the obstacles exhibit a collision scenario with low, diverging risks. There are no cases at an extreme risk with TTC or distances below critical thresholds. Therefore this is not identified as a collision scenario.
