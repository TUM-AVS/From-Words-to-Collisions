Obstacle 30737 is consistently getting closer to the Ego vehicle in terms of x-coordinates, while their y-coordinates remain relatively close.  The x-coordinate difference shrinks from approximately 9 meters to approximately 12 meters, making a collision a real possibility within the next few timesteps if this trend continues.

Obstacle 30739 is further away and moving faster than the ego vehicle. Although the x-coordinates are far apart, their y coordinates have a minor difference, which also needs attention in further timesteps, though the risk is lower than with Obstacle 30737.

Obstacle 30743 initially maintains a safe distance from the ego vehicle. The change in the y-coordinates shrinks from approximately 6 to 4 meters, making a collision a real possibility within the next few timesteps if this trend continues.

Obstacle 30740 appears suddenly and has a very high speed.  Its y-coordinate is significantly different from the ego vehicle, but its x-coordinate shows that it could become a risk as it continues along its current trajectory. More information is needed to assess its potential threat in future steps.
