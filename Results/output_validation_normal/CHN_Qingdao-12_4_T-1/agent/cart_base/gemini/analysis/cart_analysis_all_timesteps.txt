Here's the analysis of the scenario and the risk assessment:

**Ego Vehicle (30741.0):**

The ego vehicle is moving forward with a slightly increasing velocity and changing orientation, primarily within lanelet 978.0.

**Obstacle 30737.0:**

This obstacle is also moving forward in lanelet 251.0 with an increasing velocity. Its lateral position (y-coordinate) is very close to the ego vehicle's, suggesting they might be in adjacent lanes.  The x-coordinate difference is decreasing over time, indicating a potential for a rear-end collision if the ego vehicle's speed does not increase sufficiently or if the obstacle decelerates unexpectedly. This warrants close monitoring.  However, given the current separation and the relatively small time window, it's not yet an immediate collision risk.

**Obstacle 30739.0:**

This obstacle, in lanelet 250.0, initially exhibits high speed.  However, between t=0.4s and t=0.5s, there's a very sharp deceleration (from an acceleration of 1.686 to -5.4747). Such abrupt changes in velocity are concerning and unpredictable. This obstacle needs careful observation due to the high initial speed and erratic behavior.

**Obstacle 30743.0:**

This obstacle is in lanelet -1 (which likely indicates an undefined or error state) and is relatively slow-moving.  Its y-coordinate is significantly different from the ego vehicle's, suggesting it's not an immediate threat.

**Obstacle 30740.0:**

Appearing at t=0.7s, this obstacle is traveling at a very high velocity in lanelet 71.0. While it's far from the ego vehicle initially, its high speed means it could become a risk quickly. It requires careful attention.

**Risk Assessment:**

Based on the provided data, no collisions are imminent, and no obstacles pose an extreme risk (level 1) at this time. Obstacle 30737.0 requires close monitoring due to decreasing x-distance to the ego vehicle.  Obstacle 30739.0 deserves attention because of the erratic deceleration. Obstacle 30740.0, due to its high speed, also requires observation. However, given the information up to t=0.9s, none of these are immediately likely to cause a collision. Therefore, they would likely fall under High Risk (2) or Medium Risk (3), pending further data.
