At t=0.9s, the ego vehicle is at (653.6879, -1811.2815) with a velocity of 3.4513 and heading 0.177 radians.  Let's analyze the risk posed by each obstacle:

* **Obstacle 30737.0:** Position (665.7344, -1812.7567), velocity 6.2867, heading -0.144 radians. This obstacle is roughly 12 meters ahead and slightly to the left of the ego vehicle.  The difference in Y coordinates is small (-1.4752 meters), making a lateral collision unlikely given the different headings. The positive closing velocity indicates a longitudinal risk if the vehicles maintain their current trajectories.  Given the closing velocities and distance of only 12m, this presents a high risk

* **Obstacle 30739.0:** Position (680.3391, -1811.3406), velocity 8.0286, heading -0.1436 radians. Similar to Obstacle 30737, this obstacle is further ahead but more aligned with the ego vehicle's Y coordinate.  The higher velocity increases the risk, but the increased longitudinal distance offsets this somewhat.  Overall, still a medium risk.

* **Obstacle 30740.0:** Position (666.2043, -1786.6914), velocity 20.2605, heading 3.0057 radians. This obstacle is at a similar X coordinate but a significantly different Y coordinate (about 25 meters). The large difference in Y, combined with the high velocity and diverging headings, indicates a low risk of collision.

* **Obstacle 30743.0:** Position (647.3107, -1816.6937), velocity 2.492, heading 1.315 radians. This obstacle is behind the ego vehicle and slightly to the left. While the headings differ, the proximity and opposite Y-direction movement should be flagged as a medium risk for a rear-end or side-swipe collision if the ego vehicle were to slow down or change lanes to the left.


Based on the analysis above, no obstacle poses an immediate or certain collision risk at t=0.9s. Obstacle 30737.0 presents the highest risk due to proximity and closing velocity.
