### Analysis:

1. **Obstacle 30737 (Lanelet 251.0)**:
   - **Position**: (665.7344, -1812.7567) at 0.9s
   - **Relative Position to Ego**: Ego is at (653.6879, -1811.2815), obstacle is ahead by ~12.05m longitudinally and ~1.48m laterally.
   - **Velocity**: 6.2867 m/s (faster than ego's 3.4513 m/s).
   - **TTC**: Not immediately critical as the obstacle is moving away from the ego.
   - **Risk**: **Low (4)** - Safe distance and diverging paths.

2. **Obstacle 30739 (Lanelet 250.0)**:
   - **Position**: (680.3391, -1811.3406) at 0.9s
   - **Relative Position to Ego**: ~26.65m ahead longitudinally and ~0.94m laterally.
   - **Velocity**: 8.0286 m/s (decelerating but still faster than ego).
   - **TTC**: Not critical due to large distance.
   - **Risk**: **Negligible (5)** - No significant risk.

3. **Obstacle 30740 (Lanelet 71.0)**:
   - **Position**: (666.2043, -1786.6914) at 0.9s
   - **Relative Position to Ego**: ~24.59m laterally (different lane) and ~25.59m longitudinally.
   - **Velocity**: 20.2605 m/s (very high speed but orthogonal trajectory).
   - **TTC**: Not applicable due to orthogonal paths.
   - **Risk**: **Negligible (5)** - No intersection with ego's path.

4. **Obstacle 30743 (Lanelet -1.0)**:
   - **Position**: (647.3107, -1816.6937) at 0.9s
   - **Relative Position to Ego**: ~6.38m behind longitudinally and ~4.41m laterally.
   - **Velocity**: 2.492 m/s (slower than ego).
   - **TTC**: Not critical as it is behind and slower.
   - **Risk**: **Low (4)** - Safe distance and diverging paths.
