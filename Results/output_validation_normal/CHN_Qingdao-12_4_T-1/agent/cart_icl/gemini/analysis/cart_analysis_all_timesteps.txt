At t=0.9s, the ego vehicle at (653.6879, -1811.2815) is moving with a velocity of 3.4513 and acceleration of 0.7033.  Let's analyze each obstacle:

* **Obstacle 30737:** Located at (665.7344, -1812.7567), it's roughly 12 meters ahead and slightly to the left of the ego vehicle and moving in a similar direction with a higher velocity (6.2867). Although the lateral distance is small, the obstacle's similar orientation suggests it's in an adjacent lane. Given its higher velocity, it is likely to pull further ahead, lessening risk. Risk: **Medium (3)**

* **Obstacle 30739:** Located at (680.3391, -1811.3406), this obstacle is approximately 27 meters ahead of the ego and nearly at the same y-coordinate, indicating it's in the same lane or a neighboring lane. Its velocity, although previously higher, has decreased to 8.0286 at this time step. The substantial longitudinal separation suggests ample time for the ego to react if needed. Risk: **Low (4)**

* **Obstacle 30740:** At (666.2043, -1786.6914), this obstacle is about 12 meters ahead in the x-direction but significantly further north (positive y-axis) from the ego. Given this lateral separation and the different orientations, a collision is unlikely. Risk: **Negligible (5)**

* **Obstacle 30743:** Positioned at (647.3107, -1816.6937), this obstacle is around 6 meters behind the ego and to the left. Although the orientation and lanelet suggest it might be in a different section of the road or a different lane, its proximity warrants attention. It also exhibits a slower velocity compared to the ego vehicle, which could mitigate the collision risk as the ego is moving away faster. Risk: **Low (4)**
