At the latest timestamp (0.9 seconds), we analyze the positions, velocities, orientations, and other dynamics of the ego vehicle and the obstacles in consideration.

### Detailed Evaluation:

**Ego Vehicle (30741.0):**
- Position: (653.6879, -1811.2815)
- Velocity: 3.4513 m/s
- Orientation: ~0.177 radians
- Located in lanelet 978.0

**Obstacle 30737.0:**
- Position: (665.7344, -1812.7567)
- Velocity: 6.2867 m/s
- Located in lanelet 251.0
- Longitudinal distance from Ego: Approximately 12.0465 meters
- Relative velocity with respect to Ego: ~2.8354 m/s (Obstacle faster)
- TTC = 12.0465 / 2.8354 ≈ 4.25 seconds
- Risk assessment: Low risk, as the obstacle is in a different lanelet and moving away.

**Obstacle 30739.0:**
- Position: (680.3391, -1811.3406)
- Velocity: 8.0286 m/s
- Located in lanelet 250.0
- Longitudinal distance from Ego: Approximately 26.6512 meters
- Relative velocity with respect to Ego: ~4.5773 m/s (Obstacle faster)
- TTC = 26.6512 / 4.5773 ≈ 5.82 seconds
- Risk assessment: Negligible risk, as the obstacle is ahead and in a different lanelet.

**Obstacle 30740.0:**
- Position: (666.2043, -1786.6914)
- Velocity: 20.2605 m/s
- Currently distant, and also in lanelet 71.0 (different and non-adjacent)
- Risk assessment: Negligible risk due to a vast spatial separation.

**Obstacle 30743.0:**
- Position: (647.3107, -1816.6937)
- Velocity: 2.492 m/s
- Located in lanelet -1.0 (not an active lane)
- Longitudinal and lateral distance from Ego: Relatively close but oriented differently
- Risk assessment: Low risk, given disparate orientation and position.

### Conclusion:
None of the obstacles present an immediate or high risk to the ego vehicle given their diverse orientations, velocities, and locations. Using MDT (Minimum Distance to Twimpact) and Time to Collision (TTC) metrics, all show safe interactions at the current moment.
