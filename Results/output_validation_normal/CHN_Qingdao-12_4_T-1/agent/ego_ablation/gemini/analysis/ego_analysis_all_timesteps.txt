At the most recent timestep (0.9 seconds), Obstacle 30740 shows a concerning behavior. While it is moving away laterally to the left, it is approaching the ego car longitudinally with a high relative velocity of -22.73 m/s and a longitudinal distance of 12.14 m. This represents a potential risk.  The lateral distance is large enough (20.39 m) that lateral movement is unlikely to cause an immediate collision.  However, the high closing speed longitudinally makes this obstacle worth monitoring.  It is classified as a high risk, given that there is still some time to react, and the longitudinal velocity might change before a collision occurs. Other obstacles appear to pose no immediate threat as they are moving away from the ego vehicle both longitudinally and laterally. Obstacle 30743 is moderately close laterally and longitudinally, but moving away longitudinally, and therefore presents a lower risk.
