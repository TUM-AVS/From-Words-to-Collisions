At t=0.9s, Obstacle 30740 is moving towards the ego vehicle longitudinally at a high speed (-22.73 m/s) and is only 12.14m away. This represents an extreme risk of collision. While it is moving laterally away from the ego vehicle, the longitudinal speed and proximity are the dominant factors. Obstacle 30743 is consistently behind and to the right of the ego vehicle, and its lateral movement is towards the ego vehicle. While it is moving away longitudinally, its proximity and lateral movement should be monitored, posing a medium risk. Obstacles 30737 and 30739 are moving away from the ego vehicle both longitudinally and laterally, and thus represent a negligible risk.
