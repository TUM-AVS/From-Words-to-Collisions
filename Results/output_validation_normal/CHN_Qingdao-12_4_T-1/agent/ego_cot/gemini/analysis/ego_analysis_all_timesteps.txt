### Safety analysis for timestep 0.9s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

**- Obstacle ID: 30737**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is located in the front-right at a safe distance (7.09m longitudinal and 7.09m lateral). It's moving away from the ego vehicle both longitudinally and laterally.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason:  The obstacle is moving away from the ego vehicle, indicating no immediate time-to-collision risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

**- Obstacle ID: 30739**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is located far from the ego vehicle in the front-right (21.72m longitudinal and 21.72m lateral), posing no risk.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason:  Due to the large distance and the fact that the obstacle is moving away, there's no time-to-collision risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

**- Obstacle ID: 30740**
- Distance Risk reason:  While the obstacle is at a reasonable distance (12.14m longitudinal and lateral), it's approaching the ego vehicle longitudinally at high speed (-22.73 m/s) although it is moving away laterally. This presents a potential risk.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: The high longitudinal closing velocity indicates a medium risk in terms of time-to-collision, making it important to monitor this obstacle closely.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3

**- Obstacle ID: 30743**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is close to the ego vehicle in the rear-right (-2.72m longitudinal and lateral). Though it's moving away longitudinally, it is getting closer in the lateral direction and needs attention.
- Distance safety score: 2
- Time Risk reason: While the longitudinal motion suggests no immediate collision risk, the lateral movement warrants caution and monitoring.
- Time safety score: 2
- Overall Risk score: 2
