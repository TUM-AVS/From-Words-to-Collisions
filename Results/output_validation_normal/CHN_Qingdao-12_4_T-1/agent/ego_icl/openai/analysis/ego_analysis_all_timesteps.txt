Given the scenario and the most recent timestep at 0.9 seconds, here is the analysis for each obstacle:

### Obstacle 30737
- **Position**: Front-right
- **Adjusted Longitudinal Distance**: 7.09 m
- **Adjusted Lateral Distance**: -1.96 m
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal 2.51 m/s (moving away), Lateral -1.98 m/s (moving right)
- **Motion**: Moving away both longitudinally and laterally

**Trajectory Analysis**:
- At each timestep, both longitudinal and lateral distances are increasing, indicating movement away from the ego vehicle.

**TTC and MDC Calculation**:
- **TTC (Longitudinal)**: Not applicable as the obstacle is moving away
- **TTC (Lateral)**: Positive relative lateral velocity moving away
- **MDC**: Since both relative distances are increasing, MDC > 5 meters

**Risk Assessment**:
- Risk Score: 5 (Negligible Risk)

### Obstacle 30739
- **Position**: Front-right
- **Adjusted Longitudinal Distance**: 21.72 m
- **Adjusted Lateral Distance**: -3.14 m
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal 4.17 m/s (moving away), Lateral -2.53 m/s (moving right)
- **Motion**: Moving away both longitudinally and laterally

**Trajectory Analysis**:
- Consistently moving away over timesteps with increasing distances.

**TTC and MDC Calculation**:
- **TTC (Longitudinal)**: Not applicable
- **TTC (Lateral)**: Does not pose collision risk as it moves away
- **MDC**: Both distances increasing, therefore MDC > 5 meters

**Risk Assessment**:
- Risk Score: 5 (Negligible Risk)

### Obstacle 30740
- **Position**: Front-left
- **Adjusted Longitudinal Distance**: 12.14 m
- **Adjusted Lateral Distance**: 20.39 m
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal -22.73 m/s (approaching), Lateral 6.24 m/s (moving left)
- **Motion**: Approaching longitudinally, moving away laterally

**Trajectory Analysis**:
- Approaching rapid longitudinally, but lateral movement indicates separation.

**TTC and MDC Calculation**:
- **TTC (Longitudinal)**: 12.14 / 22.73 â‰ˆ 0.535 seconds
- **TTC (Lateral)**: Not approaching as it moves away
- **MDC**: Considering both directions, the potential collision mainly longitudinally

**Risk Assessment**:
- Risk Score: 2 (High Risk) due to fast longitudinal approach despite lateral separation

### Obstacle 30743
- **Position**: Rear-right
- **Adjusted Longitudinal Distance**: -2.72 m
- **Adjusted Lateral Distance**: -2.59 m
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal -2.41 m/s (moving away), Lateral 2.26 m/s (approaching left)
- **Motion**: Moving away longitudinally, approaching laterally

**Trajectory Analysis**:
- Longitudinal distance is slightly negative, moving away. However, lateral distance shows it approaching.

**TTC and MDC Calculation**:
- **TTC (Longitudinal)**: Not applicable
- **TTC (Lateral)**: MDC is complementary since it's moving horizontally toward the ego
- **MDC**: Since the lateral movement is significant, real risk comes from lateral convergence

**Risk Assessment**:
- Risk Score: 3 (Medium Risk) due to lateral convergence, though longitudinal risk is not critical

### Conclusion:
- **Obstacle 30740** presents a high risk due to its rapid approach longitudinally albeit with lateral movement away.
- Other obstacles present lower risks owing to their trajectories moving away from the ego vehicle.
