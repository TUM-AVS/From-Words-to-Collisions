At t=0.9s, Ego (30741.0) is at (653.6879, -1811.2815) in lanelet 978.0.

Obstacle 30737.0 is at (665.7344, -1812.7567) in lanelet 251.0.  While the y-coordinates are close, the x-coordinates are separated by over 12 units. Given the current velocities and orientations, a collision is not imminent in the next few timesteps.

Obstacle 30739.0 is at (680.3391, -1811.3406) in lanelet 250.0. Similar to 30737.0, the y-coordinates are close but the x difference is significant (over 26 units). No immediate collision risk.

Obstacle 30740.0 is at (666.2043, -1786.6914) in lanelet 71.0.  The y-coordinate difference is now significant (over 24 units) indicating a likely different road/level. No collision risk.

Obstacle 30743.0 is at (647.3107, -1816.6937) in lanelet -1.0.  The x-coordinates are close but the y-coordinates differ by more than 5 units.  Combined with the different orientations, collision is unlikely.
