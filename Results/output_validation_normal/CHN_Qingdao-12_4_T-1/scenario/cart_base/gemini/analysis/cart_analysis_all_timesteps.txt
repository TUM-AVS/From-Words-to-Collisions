At t=0.9s, Ego is at (653.6879, -1811.2815) in lanelet 978.0.

Obstacle 30737.0 is at (665.7344, -1812.7567) in lanelet 251.0.  While the y-coordinates are close, the x-coordinates are separated by over 12 units. Given the current velocities and orientations, a collision is not imminent in the next immediate timestep.

Obstacle 30739.0 is at (680.3391, -1811.3406) in lanelet 250.0. This obstacle is even further away in the x-direction than 30737.0, posing less risk.

Obstacle 30740.0 is at (666.2043, -1786.6914) in lanelet 71.0. Although the x-coordinate is relatively close to the ego vehicle, the y-coordinate shows a significant separation of approximately 25 units.  The data suggests this obstacle is moving fast, but not directly towards the ego vehicle.  No immediate collision risk.

Obstacle 30743.0 is at (647.3107, -1816.6937) in lanelet -1.0. This obstacle is behind the ego vehicle and poses no immediate threat.
