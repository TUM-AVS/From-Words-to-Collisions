### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 30737.0
- Distance Risk reason: Lateral distance is small and decreasing, though lanelets differ. Longitudinal velocities suggest closing.
- Distance safety score: 2
- Time Risk reason:  Relative longitudinal velocity suggests potential for collision if ego maintains current lane and velocity.
- Time safety score: 2
- Overall Risk score: 2

- Obstacle ID: 30739.0
- Distance Risk reason: Increasing lateral and longitudinal distance from ego. Different lanelets.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Relative speed and direction suggest no immediate threat.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- Obstacle ID: 30740.0
- Distance Risk reason:  Significant longitudinal and lateral separation, different lanelets.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: No immediate risk due to large separation, despite obstacle's higher velocity.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 30742.0
- Distance Risk reason: Significant and increasing separation in both axes, different lanelets.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason:  Large distance and relative velocity suggest no immediate threat.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 30743.0
- Distance Risk reason: Lateral distance is small, increasing; different lanelets. No collision imminent.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: Low relative velocity and divergent trajectories suggest no immediate danger.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4


### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. At the latest timestep (0.9s), obstacle 30737.0 poses the highest risk due to its proximity and closing velocity.
2. No obstacle is predicted to collide with the ego vehicle within the observed timeframe.
3. Although 30737.0 shows high risk, it's not a collision at 0.9s.
