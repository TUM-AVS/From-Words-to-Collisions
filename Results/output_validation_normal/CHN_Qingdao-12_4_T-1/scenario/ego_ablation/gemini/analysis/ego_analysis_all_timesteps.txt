Obstacle 30740 shows a high longitudinal closing velocity (-22.73 m/s) while the longitudinal distance is 12.14 meters. This implies a possible collision within the next second. Although the lateral distance and velocity suggest it might miss, the high closing speed warrants attention, making it a high-risk obstacle. However, with a lateral distance of 20.39m and lateral velocity of 6.24 m/s, the lateral movement indicates it is moving away from the ego vehicle and reduces the collision possibility.

Obstacle 30743, located at the rear-right, exhibits a consistent lateral movement toward the ego vehicle despite moving away longitudinally.  At the last timestep, the lateral distance is -2.59 m and the relative lateral velocity is 2.26 m/s, indicating a potential lateral collision risk. While not immediately critical, this obstacle warrants monitoring due to its continuous lateral approach.

  "ScenarioAnalysis": {
    "IsCollisionScenario": false,
    "Reasoning": "Obstacle 30740 has a high closing velocity and relatively small longitudinal distance, posing an extreme risk. While the lateral movement suggests it may not collide, it's still classified as extremely risky due to the fast approach. No immediate collision detected with other obstacles."
