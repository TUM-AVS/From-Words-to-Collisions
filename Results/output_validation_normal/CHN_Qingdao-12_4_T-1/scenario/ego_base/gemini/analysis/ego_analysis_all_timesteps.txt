At t=0.9s, Obstacle 30740 is moving towards the ego vehicle longitudinally at a high relative velocity (-22.73 m/s) and is only 12.14m away longitudinally.  While it is moving laterally away from the ego vehicle, the high closing speed longitudinally presents an extreme risk. Other obstacles are not an immediate concern at this timestep.

**Risk Levels and Definitions:**
Collision (Score: 0): Actual collision has occurred or is unavoidable within the next timestep.
Extreme Risk (Score: 1): Immediate collision or very high likelihood of impact. Urgent action is required.
High Risk (Score: 2): Close to collision or highly probable collision path. Needs prompt attention and quick manoeuvring.
Medium Risk (Score: 3): Moderate collision risk but manageable with timely reactions and proper strategies.
Low Risk (Score: 4): Minimal collision risk. The situation is controllable with sufficient time to react.
Negligible Risk (Score: 5): No significant collision risk. Obstacles are either moving away or far enough not to interfere.
