### Safety analysis for timestep 0.9 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

**Missing Information:** The provided scenario lacks crucial information for accurate TTC and MDC calculation.  Specifically, we need the ego vehicle's dimensions and the adjusted longitudinal and lateral distances (adjusted_d_long, adjusted_d_lat) that take ego vehicle size into account.  I will make assumptions to demonstrate the analysis process, but please note these results may not be accurate without the complete data.

**Assumptions:**
* Ego vehicle dimensions are approximately 4m long and 2m wide.
* Adjusted distances will be estimated by subtracting half the ego vehicle's dimensions from the provided distances where applicable (this is a simplified approach and proper vehicle geometry should be used in a real system).


### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 30737**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is located front-right with distances of 7.09m longitudinal and 7.09m lateral, placing it relatively far from the ego vehicle. Assuming adjusted distances maintain a safe margin.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Obstacle is moving away both longitudinally and laterally, reducing collision risk. Accurate TTC calculation is impossible without relative velocity and acceleration, but the current motion suggests low risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 30739**
- Distance Risk reason: Located far front-right (21.72m longitudinal and 21.72 lateral), posing no immediate threat.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Moving away both longitudinally and laterally. Although the longitudinal acceleration is negative, the distance is large enough to not present a concern in the immediate future.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 30740**
- Distance Risk reason:  Located front-left with distances of 12.14m longitudinally and 12.14m laterally.  While moving closer longitudinally (-22.73 m/s), the lateral movement is away from the ego vehicle (6.24 m/s), reducing the immediate risk. Requires monitoring.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Closing longitudinally at a high speed warrants attention.  Approximate TTC assuming constant velocity would be less than 1 second. However, the lateral movement away provides some margin.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3

- **Obstacle ID: 30743**
- Distance Risk reason: Located in the rear-right, relatively close (-2.72m longitudinal and -2.72m lateral). Depending on the adjusted distance and vehicle dimensions, there might be an overlap.
- Distance safety score: 2
- Time Risk reason: Moving away longitudinally (-2.41 m/s) mitigates some risk, but moving closer laterally (2.26 m/s) is concerning. TTC calculation is needed to be definitive about the risk level.
- Time safety score: 2
- Overall Risk score: 2


### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
  "CollisionObstacle": null,
  "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null,
  "IsCollisionScenario": false,
  "Justification": "While Obstacle 30743 presents a high risk (score 2) due to proximity and lateral movement towards the ego vehicle, and Obstacle 30740 presents medium risk due to its high closing speed, no obstacle has an Overall Risk Score of 0 (collision) or 1 (extreme risk) within the assessed timeframe of 0.9 seconds."
