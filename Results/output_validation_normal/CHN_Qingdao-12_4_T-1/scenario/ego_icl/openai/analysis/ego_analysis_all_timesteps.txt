### Obstacle-By-Obstacle Analysis

**Obstacle 30737:**
- **Position and Motion**:
  - Adjusted Longitudinal Distance: 7.09 m
  - Adjusted Lateral Distance: -1.96 m (right of ego)
  - Relative Velocity: Longitudinal 2.51 m/s, Lateral -1.98 m/s (moving away laterally)
- **Trajectory and Risk Calculation**:
  - **TTC_Longitudinal**: Not applicable since the obstacle is moving away.
  - **TTC_Lateral**: Distance/|Relative Velocity| = 1.96 m / 1.98 m/s ≈ 0.99 seconds (moving away)
  - **MDC**: With obstacles moving away in both dimensions, there’s a decline in collision probability.
  - **Risk Assessment**: 
    - Longitudinal: No Risk due to increasing distance
    - Lateral: High Risk (TTC < 1.0 seconds for lateral)

**Obstacle 30739:**
- **Position and Motion**:
  - Adjusted Longitudinal Distance: 21.72 m
  - Adjusted Lateral Distance: -3.14 m (right of ego)
  - Relative Velocity: Longitudinal 4.17 m/s, Lateral -2.53 m/s (moving away laterally)
- **Trajectory and Risk Calculation**:
  - **TTC_Longitudinal**: Not applicable, moving away.
  - **TTC_Lateral**: Distance/|Relative Velocity| = 3.14 m / 2.53 m/s ≈ 1.24 seconds
  - **MDC**: No imminent collision path; obstacle is diverging in both directions.
  - **Risk Assessment**:
    - Longitudinal: No Risk
    - Lateral: Medium Risk (TTC < 3.0 seconds for lateral)

**Obstacle 30740:**
- **Position and Motion**:
  - Adjusted Longitudinal Distance: 12.14 m
  - Adjusted Lateral Distance: 20.39 m (left of ego)
  - Relative Velocity: Longitudinal -22.73 m/s, Lateral 6.24 m/s (approaching longitudinally)
- **Trajectory and Risk Calculation**:
  - **TTC_Longitudinal**: Distance / |Relative Velocity| = 12.14 m / 22.73 m/s ≈ 0.53 seconds
  - **TTC_Lateral**: Not relevant, moving away.
  - **MDC**: Factors show significant longitudinal closing velocity.
  - **Risk Assessment**: 
    - Longitudinal: High Risk (TTC < 1.0 seconds)
    - Lateral: No Risk, diverging paths

**Obstacle 30743:**
- **Position and Motion**:
  - Adjusted Longitudinal Distance: -2.72 m (behind)
  - Adjusted Lateral Distance: -2.59 m (right)
  - Relative Velocity: Longitudinal -2.41 m/s, Lateral 2.26 m/s (approaching laterally)
- **Trajectory and Risk Calculation**:
  - **TTC_Longitudinal**: Not applicable, moving away.
  - **TTC_Lateral**: Distance / |Relative Velocity| = 2.59 m / 2.26 m/s ≈ 1.15 seconds
  - **MDC**: Substantial lateral closing path.
  - **Risk Assessment**:
    - Longitudinal: No Risk, moving away
    - Lateral: High Risk (TTC < 1.0 seconds for lateral)

### Conclusion

The main risk comes from **Obstacle 30740**, which has a significant longitudinal closing velocity, indicating a high risk of collision longitudinally with a TTC of approximately 0.53 seconds. However, note that paths are diverging laterally. Nevertheless, the immediate longitudinal risk is critical.
