Obstacle 30737 (in lanelet 251) is moving with a higher velocity (around 8-9 m/s) than the ego vehicle (around 2 m/s). While its x-coordinate is greater than the ego vehicle's, suggesting it might be slightly ahead and to the right, the y-coordinates are very close, indicating potential lateral proximity. However, over the provided timestamps, the difference in y-coordinates doesn't decrease significantly, and Obstacle 30737 seems to be moving roughly parallel to the ego vehicle.  It is eventually removed from the context, implying it may have left the ego vehicle's sensor range or area of interest.


Obstacle 30739 (in lanelet 977) initially has x and y coordinates relatively close to the ego vehicle. While it starts with a lower velocity than the ego vehicle, it accelerates over the subsequent timestamps.  The y-coordinates of the ego and obstacle 30739 remain separated by a small amount (around 7-8 meters), but the x-coordinate difference decreases slightly over time as the obstacle moves faster.  This suggests a potential risk if this trend continues, but within the observed timeframe, the separation is still significant enough to not pose an immediate collision risk.


Given the provided data, neither obstacle presents an immediate collision risk. While Obstacle 30739 warrants some attention due to the closing distance in the x-coordinate, there's no clear indication of a high probability of collision within the next few timesteps.  More data points would be needed to make a definitive assessment.
