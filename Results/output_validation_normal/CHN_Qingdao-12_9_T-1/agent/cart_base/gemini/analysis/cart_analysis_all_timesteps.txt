Obstacle 30737 (in lanelet 251) appears to be moving quickly (velocity around 9 m/s initially and decelerating) but its y-coordinate (-1814) suggests it's not on a direct collision course with the ego vehicle (y-coordinate around -1815).  It also gets further away over time.

Obstacle 30739 (in lanelet 977) is closer to the ego vehicle in terms of y-coordinate and its x-coordinate is approaching the ego vehicle's x-coordinate.  This obstacle's velocity is also increasing slightly. This obstacle poses a potential risk but doesn't appear to be an immediate collision risk within the timeframe of the provided data.

Given the provided data, no collisions are observed, and no obstacle poses an immediate extreme risk. Obstacle 30739 warrants monitoring, but it doesn't pose a high risk at this time.
