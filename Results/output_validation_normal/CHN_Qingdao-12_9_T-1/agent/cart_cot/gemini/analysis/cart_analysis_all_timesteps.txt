At t=0.9s, the ego vehicle is at (648.322, -1813.8039) with a velocity of 1.9837 and obstacle 30739 is at (656.9089, -1807.9456) with a velocity of 4.1273.  Obstacle 30737 is no longer present in the data after t=0.4s, suggesting it has left the area of concern.

**Analysis focusing on t=0.9s:**

1. **Position Difference:**
    - Δx = 656.9089 - 648.322 = 8.5869
    - Δy = -1807.9456 - (-1813.8039) = 5.8583

2. **Velocity Difference:**
    - Δvx = 4.1273 - 1.9837 = 2.1436
    - Δvy ≈ 0 (assuming velocities are primarily in the x-direction based on minimal change in y-position for both ego and obstacle). This assumption is made for simplicity and could be refined with more information about velocity vectors.


3. **Approximate TTC (assuming constant velocity):**
    - TTCx = Δx / Δvx = 8.5869 / 2.1436 ≈ 4.0 seconds
    - TTCy is not meaningful in this scenario since the vehicles are moving away from each other in the y direction.

4. **Minimum Distance Calculation (MDC):**
    The current distance between the ego vehicle and obstacle 30739 is sqrt(Δx² + Δy²) = sqrt(8.5869² + 5.8583²) ≈ 10.39 meters.

5. **Risk Assessment:**

* **Obstacle 30739:**  While the TTC is around 4 seconds and the MDC is above 10 meters, the substantial difference in x-velocities necessitates continued monitoring. The relative velocity indicates the gap between the ego vehicle and the obstacle is closing.  Given the current data, this obstacle represents a *Medium Risk* (Overall Risk Score: 3).

* **Obstacle 30737:** As it has left the area of concern, it poses no risk (Overall Risk Score: 5, not included in the summary JSON since risk isn't 0 or 1).
