At t=0.9s, the ego vehicle is at (648.322, -1813.8039) with a velocity of 1.9837 m/s and an orientation of 1.03567 radians.  Let's analyze the obstacle 30739:

**Obstacle 30739 (t=0.9s):**

* Position: (656.9089, -1807.9456)
* Velocity: 4.1273 m/s
* Orientation: -0.1436 radians

**Calculations:**

* **Delta X:** 656.9089 - 648.322 = 8.5869 m
* **Delta Y:** -1807.9456 - (-1813.8039) = 5.8583 m
* **Distance:** sqrt((8.5869)^2 + (5.8583)^2) ≈ 10.38 m

The obstacle is ahead and to the left of the ego vehicle.  The difference in orientations suggests they are not perfectly aligned. While the distance is somewhat large at this instant, we need to consider the relative velocity and directions.

Since we don't have precise information on the shapes and sizes of the vehicles, a full TTC calculation is not possible.  However, a simplified approximation considering primarily the x-component of the relative velocity can provide a basic risk estimate.  The relative x velocity is approximately 4.1273 - 1.9837 = 2.1436 m/s (obstacle is faster). This would lead to an estimated TTC of roughly 8.5869m/2.1436m/s ≈ 4.0 seconds in the x-direction, if both objects continued on their current trajectories.  This value would be smaller if the vehicles were angled towards one another and larger if angled away.  

Given the lateral separation of approximately 5.86 m, the difference in orientations, and the estimated x direction TTC of around 4 seconds, the risk is likely low.

**Overall Risk Assessment:**

While more detailed information would be needed for a precise risk assessment, based on the available data, the risk of collision with obstacle 30739 is considered low (4).
