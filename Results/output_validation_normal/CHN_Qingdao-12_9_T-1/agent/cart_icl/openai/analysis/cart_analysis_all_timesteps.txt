Let's analyze the provided scenario by evaluating the trajectories and relative motions of the ego vehicle and the obstacles, focusing primarily on the most recent timestep at 0.9 seconds.

### Detailed Analysis:

#### Ego Vehicle at 0.9 seconds:
- **Position**: (648.322, -1813.8039)
- **Orientation**: 1.0357 radians
- **Velocity**: 1.9837 m/s
- **Acceleration**: 0.3789 m/s²

#### Obstacle 30739 at 0.9 seconds:
- **Position**: (656.9089, -1807.9456)
- **Orientation**: -0.1436 radians
- **Velocity**: 4.1273 m/s
- **Acceleration**: 1.1831 m/s²

- **Relative Longitudinal Position**: The obstacle's x-coordinate is further than the ego's, indicating it is ahead.
- **Lateral Distance**: The obstacle is to the right of the ego, approximately 5.85m laterally away considering the y-coordinate difference.
- **Relative Longitudinal Velocity**: The obstacle is moving faster than the ego with a difference of approximately 2.1436 m/s.
  
- **TTC Calculation**: Since the obstacle is ahead and moving faster, the relative velocity suggests increasing separation. Thus, the situation does not immediately project a collision.
- **Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC)**: Currently approximately 9.4m combined distance in XY plane by calculating the Euclidean distance, allowing safe separation.

### Risk Assessment for Obstacle 30739:
Given the increasing separation and the low chance of collision within a short time period, Obstacle 30739 presents a low risk to the ego vehicle. The risk score is 4.

#### Other Obstacle 30737:
- ***Note***: This obstacle does not appear after 0.3 seconds, hence no immediate interaction is assumed with the ego vehicle at 0.9 seconds.

#### Collision Evaluation:
No collision is detected based on the provided details as the obstacles are either not close to or not approaching the ego vehicle with high risk factors.

### JSON Output

```json
{
    "CollisionObstacles": [],
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {},
    "HighRiskObstacle": {}
}
```

The output indicates no obstacles pose extreme or high risks, and there is no collision expected from the given trajectories.
