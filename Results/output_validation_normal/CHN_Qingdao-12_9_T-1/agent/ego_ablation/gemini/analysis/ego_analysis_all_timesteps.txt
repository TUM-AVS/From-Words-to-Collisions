At t=0.9s, obstacle 30739 is in the front-right of the ego vehicle, with a longitudinal distance of 4.91m and a lateral distance of -2.79m.  The relative longitudinal velocity is -0.41 m/s, indicating that the obstacle is slowly approaching the ego vehicle longitudinally. The lateral velocity is -3.81 m/s, meaning that it's moving away from the ego vehicle to the right. Although the longitudinal distance is decreasing, the lateral movement suggests the obstacle is unlikely to collide with the ego vehicle in the immediate future. Given the current information and short time horizon, the risk level appears low. I am rating this a 4, low risk.
