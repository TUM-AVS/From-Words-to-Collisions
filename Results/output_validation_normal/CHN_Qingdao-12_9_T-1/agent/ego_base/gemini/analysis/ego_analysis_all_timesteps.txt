At t=0.9s, obstacle 30739 is in the front-right of the ego vehicle, with a longitudinal distance of 4.91m and a lateral distance of -2.79m.  It's moving towards the ego vehicle longitudinally at -0.41 m/s and laterally to the right at -3.81 m/s. While the longitudinal velocity suggests a slow approach, the relatively close proximity, especially considering the lateral movement, warrants attention. This situation represents a medium risk, as there's still time to react, but the obstacle's trajectory needs careful monitoring.
