### Safety analysis for timestep 0.9s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:
- **Obstacle ID:** 30739
- **Distance Risk reason:** At 0.9 seconds, Obstacle 30739 is 4.91m longitudinally and 4.91m laterally away from the ego vehicle, in the front-right direction.  While the distances themselves are not extremely close, the continued longitudinal closing motion, even if slow (-0.41 m/s), suggests a need for continued monitoring. The lateral movement away from the ego vehicle (-3.81 m/s) reduces the immediate risk.
- **Distance safety score:** 4 (Low Risk)
- **Time Risk reason:**  A precise TTC calculation isn't possible without more data, but given the slow closing longitudinal velocity and relatively safe distances, the TTC is likely to be reasonably high at the last timestep.  The consistent lateral movement away from the ego vehicle further supports a lower time-based risk.
- **Time safety score:** 4 (Low Risk)
- **Overall Risk score:** 4 (Low Risk)
