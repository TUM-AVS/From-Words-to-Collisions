### Obstacle-by-Obstacle Analysis

#### Obstacle 30737
- **Most Recent Timestep (0.3s)**:
  - **Position**: Front-right of ego car
  - **Adjusted Distances**: Longitudinal 3.41 m, Lateral -26.96 m
  - **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal -1.71 m/s (approaching), Lateral -8.19 m/s (moving away)
  - **Motion**: Driving toward ego longitudinally, moving away laterally to the right.
  
- **Trajectory Analysis**:
  - Longitudinal distance is decreasing (from 5.42 m at 0.1s to 3.41 m at 0.3s), but lateral distance is increasing (from -24.70 m to -26.96 m).
  - The obstacle is moving away laterally faster than it is approaching longitudinally.

- **TTC Calculation**:
  - Longitudinal TTC: 3.41 m / 1.71 m/s = 1.99 seconds (Medium Risk)
  - Lateral TTC: Not applicable (moving away)
  
- **MDC Calculation**:
  - The obstacle is moving away laterally, so MDC is effectively the current lateral distance (26.96 m), which is very large (No Risk).

- **Overall Risk**:
  - The primary risk is longitudinal, with TTC indicating Medium Risk (3). Lateral motion is diverging, so no additional risk.
  - **Overall Risk Score**: 3 (Medium Risk)

#### Obstacle 30739
- **Most Recent Timestep (0.9s)**:
  - **Position**: Front-right of ego car
  - **Adjusted Distances**: Longitudinal 4.91 m, Lateral -2.79 m
  - **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal -0.41 m/s (approaching), Lateral -3.81 m/s (moving away)
  - **Motion**: Driving toward ego longitudinally, moving away laterally to the right.

- **Trajectory Analysis**:
  - Longitudinal distance fluctuates but generally decreases (from 5.16 m at 0.1s to 4.91 m at 0.9s).
  - Lateral distance is increasing (from -2.00 m to -2.79 m), indicating the obstacle is moving away laterally.

- **TTC Calculation**:
  - Longitudinal TTC: 4.91 m / 0.41 m/s = 11.98 seconds (No Risk)
  - Lateral TTC: Not applicable (moving away)

- **MDC Calculation**:
  - The obstacle is moving away laterally, so MDC is effectively the current lateral distance (2.79 m), which is Low Risk (4).

- **Overall Risk**:
  - Longitudinal TTC is very high (No Risk), and lateral motion is diverging.
  - **Overall Risk Score**: 4 (Low Risk)

### Summary:
- No obstacles pose a collision, extreme, or high risk at the most recent timestep.
- Obstacle 30737 has Medium Risk (3) due to longitudinal approach.
- Obstacle 30739 has Low Risk (4) due to slow longitudinal approach and lateral divergence.
