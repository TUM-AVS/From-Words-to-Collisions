### Obstacle-by-Obstacle Analysis

#### Obstacle 30737
- **Trajectory Analysis**:
  - Relative to the ego vehicle, primarily near the Front-Right.
  - Longitudinal distance decreased over time and is closing in at each timestep.
  - Lateral distance steadily increasing, indicating motion further away to the right.

- **TTC and MDC Calculations**:
  - **Longitudinal TTC**: Last seen real longitudinal velocity of -1.71 m/s with distance of 3.41m.
    - \( \text{TTC}_{\text{long}} = \frac{3.41 \, \text{m}}{|-1.71 \, \text{m/s}|} = 1.99 \, \text{s} \)
  - **MDC**: With lateral distance increasing well beyond the critical range, and the longitudinal still several meters, the minimum distance does not reach high risk levels at this projection.
  - Obstacle trajectory diverging laterally, low risk.

- **Risk Assessment**:
  - **Risk Score**: Medium Risk (3) due to closing longitudinally but diverging laterally.

#### Obstacle 30739
- **Trajectory Analysis**:
  - Positioned at the Front-Right.
  - Longitudinal distance varies slight increases and decreases but overall stable.
  - Lateral distance also fluctuating slightly, but overall tending away from the ego.

- **TTC and MDC Calculations**:
  - **Longitudinal TTC**: At 0.9 seconds, longitudinal velocity is -0.41 m/s with distance of 4.91m.
    - \( \text{TTC}_{\text{long}} = \frac{4.91 \, \text{m}}{|-0.41 \, \text{m/s}|} = 11.98 \, \text{s} \)
  - **Lateral TTC**: Velocity -3.81 m/s and distance of 2.79m.
    - \( \text{TTC}_{\text{lat}} = \frac{2.79 \, \text{m}}{|-3.81 \, \text{m/s}|} = 0.73 \, \text{s} \)
  - **MDC**: Lateral closing is more pressing, though not critically so due to velocities that see it move beside the ego vehicle with little forward convergence.
  
- **Risk Assessment**:
  - **Risk Score**: High Risk (2) as lateral movement is more prominent and should be monitored closely.

### Summary:
- No immediate collision detected; thus, no obstacle is categorized as Collision level (0).
- Obstacle 30739 presents a High Risk (2) due to its relatively low lateral TTC, warranting close monitoring. 
- Obstacle 30737 trajectory indicates a Medium Risk (3), primarily due to its increased lateral divergence, lowering overall risk profile.
