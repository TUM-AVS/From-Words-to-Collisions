At t=0.9s, Ego is at (648.322, -1813.8039) and obstacle 30739 is at (656.9089, -1807.9456).  The distance between them is approximately 8.6 meters. While this isn't extremely close, the trajectories suggest a possible collision risk.  Obstacle 30739's velocity is increasing, and Ego's velocity is fluctuating. More importantly, we lack information about lanelet geometry and widths. If these lanelets represent intersecting paths and both vehicles maintain their current trajectories, a collision is possible in the near future. Therefore, obstacle 30739 poses an extreme risk. Obstacle 30737 is no longer present in the data, suggesting it has left the area of concern.
