At t=0.9s, Ego is at (648.322, -1813.8039) and obstacle 30739 is at (656.9089, -1807.9456).  The distance between them is approximately 8.6 meters. While this might seem like a safe distance, obstacle 30739's velocity is increasing and heading towards the Ego vehicle's general location.  Given the observed acceleration patterns, it's highly probable that the vehicles will be extremely close in the next few timesteps, representing an extreme risk of collision. No collision has occurred yet.
