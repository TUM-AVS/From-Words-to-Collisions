### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep:

### Obstacle Analysis:
#### Obstacle ID: 30737.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is in lanelet 251.0, which is different from the ego's lanelet (1082.0). The distance between them is large (~28.6m at 0.1s), and the obstacle is moving away (X-coordinate increasing). No immediate proximity risk.
- **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- **Time Risk reason**: The obstacle is decelerating (a = -4.342) and moving away from the ego (relative velocity is positive). No collision trajectory.
- **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- **Overall Risk score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)

#### Obstacle ID: 30739.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is in lanelet 977.0, different from the ego's lanelet (1082.0). The distance is moderate (~8.6m at 0.9s) but increasing (obstacle is moving away in X-direction). No immediate proximity risk.
- **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
- **Time Risk reason**: The obstacle is accelerating (a = 1.1831) but moving away (relative velocity is positive). No imminent collision.
- **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
- **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low Risk)

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. **Obstacle 30737.0**: Far away, moving away, decelerating. No collision risk.
2. **Obstacle 30739.0**: Moderate distance, moving away, accelerating. No collision risk.
3. **Ego Vehicle**: Decelerating, no abrupt direction changes. No collision trajectory observed.
4. **Conclusion**: No collision scenario.
