### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 30737.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is laterally separated and moving roughly parallel to the ego vehicle.  No immediate risk is apparent, but continued monitoring is needed.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: The obstacle's velocity is decreasing, but remains higher than ego's.  The lateral separation mitigates the time risk somewhat.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3

- Obstacle ID: 30739.0
- Distance Risk reason:  This obstacle is relatively close longitudinally, but sufficient lateral separation exists.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: The obstacle's velocity is relatively low and increasing, but poses no immediate threat due to lateral separation.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3

- Obstacle ID: 30740.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is far from the ego vehicle and poses no immediate positional risk.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Obstacle is moving quickly, but its trajectory and distance suggest no immediate time-related risk.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- Obstacle ID: 30742.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is far from the ego vehicle and poses no immediate positional risk.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Obstacle is moving quickly, but its trajectory and distance suggest no immediate time-related risk.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4


### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
