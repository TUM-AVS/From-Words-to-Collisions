Obstacle 30739 is moving away laterally (to the right) but towards the ego car longitudinally. However, at the last timestep (0.9 seconds), the longitudinal distance is 4.91m and the relative longitudinal velocity is -0.41 m/s. Given the current deceleration, a collision is not imminent in the next timestep. Thus, this obstacle does not pose an extreme risk.

        "IsCollisionScenario": false,
        "Reasoning": "No obstacle is on a collision course with the ego vehicle in the next timestep. While Obstacle 30739 is moving closer longitudinally, its current distance and relative velocity suggest a low risk of collision in the immediate future."
