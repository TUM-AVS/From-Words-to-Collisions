At t=0.9s, obstacle 30739 is in the front-right of the ego vehicle, with a longitudinal distance of 4.91m and moving towards the ego vehicle at -0.41 m/s.  It is laterally moving away at -3.81 m/s. While the longitudinal velocity suggests a low immediate risk, the consistent presence and motion of this obstacle over the past second warrants attention. The decreasing longitudinal velocity also necessitates further monitoring. There is no imminent collision detected, but a potential collision possibility exists if the longitudinal velocity were to greatly decrease and the object stopped or slowed significantly.
