### Safety analysis for timestep 0.9 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:
- **Obstacle ID:** 30739
- **Distance Risk reason:** At 0.9 seconds, Obstacle 30739 is 4.91m longitudinally and 4.91m laterally away from the ego vehicle, in the front-right direction.  While the distances themselves aren't extremely close, the obstacle's continued longitudinal movement towards the ego vehicle despite being mostly lateral warrants attention.
- **Distance safety score:** 4 (Low Risk)
- **Time Risk reason:**  We don't have TTC calculations provided, but can infer some risk based on the closing longitudinal distance and the fact that the lateral movement is away from the ego vehicle.  With the given data and lack of explicit TTC we will remain cautious. It's likely that more refined TTC calculations would place this in the lower risk categories.
- **Time safety score:** 4 (Low Risk)
- **Overall Risk score:** 4 (Low Risk)


### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
    "CollisionObstacle": null,
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null,
    "IsCollisionScenario": false,
    "Justification": "No obstacle has an Overall Risk Score of 0 (collision) or 1 (extreme risk). The closest obstacle (30739) maintains a safe distance at the last timestep and is moving away laterally, though still closing slightly longitudinally. The lack of precise TTC values prevents definitive risk assessment, so caution is maintained but not escalated to extreme or collision levels."
}
