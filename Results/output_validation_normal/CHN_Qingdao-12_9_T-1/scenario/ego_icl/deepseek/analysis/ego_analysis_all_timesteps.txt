### Obstacle-by-Obstacle Analysis

#### Obstacle 30737 (Most Recent Timestep: 0.3s)
- **Position**: Front-right of ego car
- **Adjusted Distances**: 
  - Longitudinal: 3.41 m (approaching at -1.71 m/s)
  - Lateral: -26.96 m (moving away at -8.19 m/s)
- **Motion**: 
  - Driving toward ego longitudinally (closing distance)
  - Moving away laterally to the right (increasing lateral distance)
- **TTC Calculation**:
  - Longitudinal TTC: 3.41 / 1.71 ≈ 1.99 seconds (Medium Risk)
  - Lateral TTC: Not applicable (moving away)
- **MDC Calculation**:
  - Lateral distance is large (26.96 m) and increasing → No Risk (5)
  - Longitudinal distance is closing but still > 3.0 m → Low Risk (4)
- **Overall Risk**: Medium Risk (3) due to longitudinal TTC.

#### Obstacle 30739 (Most Recent Timestep: 0.9s)
- **Position**: Front-right of ego car
- **Adjusted Distances**: 
  - Longitudinal: 4.91 m (approaching at -0.41 m/s)
  - Lateral: -2.79 m (moving away at -3.81 m/s)
- **Motion**: 
  - Driving toward ego longitudinally (closing distance)
  - Moving away laterally to the right (increasing lateral distance)
- **TTC Calculation**:
  - Longitudinal TTC: 4.91 / 0.41 ≈ 11.98 seconds (No Risk)
  - Lateral TTC: Not applicable (moving away)
- **MDC Calculation**:
  - Lateral distance is 2.79 m and increasing → Low Risk (4)
  - Longitudinal distance is 4.91 m and closing slowly → Low Risk (4)
- **Overall Risk**: Low Risk (4).

### Trajectory Analysis
- **Obstacle 30737**: 
  - Longitudinal distance decreases from 5.42 m (0.1s) to 3.41 m (0.3s), but acceleration is negative (-4.15 m/s²), suggesting deceleration.
  - Lateral distance increases rapidly (moving away).
- **Obstacle 30739**: 
  - Longitudinal distance fluctuates but remains > 4.0 m, with low closing velocity (-0.41 m/s).
  - Lateral distance increases steadily (moving away).

### Risk Summary
- Neither obstacle has a risk score of 0 (collision) or 1 (extreme risk).
- Obstacle 30737 has the highest risk (Medium Risk, score 3), but it is not extreme or imminent.
- Obstacle 30739 poses Low Risk (score 4).

### Final Determination
This is **not** a collision scenario. No obstacle is in immediate danger of colliding with the ego vehicle.
