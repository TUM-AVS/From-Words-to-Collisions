### Obstacle-by-Obstacle Analysis

**Obstacle 30739**

1. **Trajectory Analysis:**
   - The obstacle has been consistently in the front-right of the ego vehicle.
   - Over recent timesteps, obstacle 30739 shows reducing longitudinal and slightly varying lateral distances. It is moving toward the ego longitudinally but also moving outward laterally, indicating no immediate cross-path trajectory.

2. **Most Recent Timestep (0.9 seconds):**
   - **Adjusted Longitudinal Distance:** Use the adjusted value for a more accurate perspective (not provided, but assuming negligible adjustment since core data needed).
   - **Adjusted Lateral Distance:** Similarly adjusted measurements are usually minimal.
   - **Relative Velocities:** Longitudinal -0.41 m/s (approaching); Lateral -3.81 m/s (moving outward).

3. **TTC Calculation:**
   - **Longitudinal TTC:** 
     \[
     \text{TTC} = \frac{4.91 \text{ m}}{|-0.41 \text{ m/s}|} \approx 11.98 \text{ seconds}
     \]
     (approaching very slowly longitudinally)
   - **Lateral TTC:**
     Not applicable directly since the lateral distance is increasing (moving outward).

4. **MDC Calculation:**
   - Initially assuming no adjusted distances, use the last provided distances:
   - Longitudinal MDC â‰ˆ 4.91 m
   - Lateral MDC analyzed since moving outward = greater than initial lateral risk threshold.

5. **Risk Assessment:**
   - **Longitudinal Component:** No risk due to far distance and very slow closure (11.98s)
   - **Lateral Component:** Decreasing lateral proximity but moving away makes intersection unlikely in this timeframe.
   - **Risk Score:** No Risk (5)

### Conclusion

After analyzing the trajectory, positions, and velocities of obstacle 30739, no immediate risk of collision is indicated. All metrics (TTC and MDC) signify no collision path due to the lateral component and slow longitudinal approaches. Risk assessment categorizes it under **No Risk**.

### JSON Summary:
```json
{
    "CollisionObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "N/A",
        "OverallRiskScore": "None"
    },
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "N/A",
        "OverallRiskScore": "None"
    },
    "IsCollisionScenario": false,
    "Justification": "No obstacles have a risk score of 0 or 1; all calculated paths suggest no imminent collision."
}
```

In this scenario, with no obstacles indicating immediate collision risk, it's clearly not a collision scenario.
