Obstacles 30618 and 30619 are in lanelet 381, while the ego vehicle is in lanelet 382.  The x-coordinates of obstacles 30618 and 30619 are increasing, meaning they are moving further from the ego vehicle. Although obstacle 30618 has a higher velocity and acceleration than the ego vehicle and is getting closer in the y-coordinate (longitudinally), it is moving away laterally, reducing the collision risk. Obstacles 30620 and 30621 are located in different lanelets and their trajectories do not suggest an immediate risk of collision.
