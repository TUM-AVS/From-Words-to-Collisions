At t=0.9s, the ego vehicle is at (523.5206, -1449.1458) with a velocity of 5.9381 and heading 0.3862 rad. Let's analyze each obstacle:

* **Obstacle 30618:** Position (500.7351, -1454.6186), Velocity 14.4636, Heading -2.7558 rad. This obstacle is moving faster than the ego vehicle and in the opposite direction along the y-axis (indicated by the large difference in heading). Although the y-coordinates are somewhat close, the obstacle's high velocity and opposing direction create a low risk of collision. The x-coordinates show a significant separation, further decreasing the likelihood of collision in the immediate future.  Risk Score: 4

* **Obstacle 30619:** Position (522.1604, -1445.9288), Velocity 11.9209, Heading -2.7587 rad. Similar to Obstacle 30618, this obstacle is also moving in the opposite direction with a high velocity. However, the x-coordinates are much closer. Considering the velocities and directions, a collision is unlikely in the immediate future. Further monitoring is needed. Risk Score: 3

* **Obstacle 30620:** Position (541.577, -1448.1638), Velocity 7.2686, Heading -0.9965 rad. This obstacle is on a different lanelet and presents very little risk. Risk Score: 5

* **Obstacle 30621:** Position (536.359, -1435.8088), Velocity 7.4482, Heading -1.5355 rad. The y-coordinate difference indicates a safe distance for the predicted short-term future. The different lanelets also contribute to this assessment. Risk Score: 5
