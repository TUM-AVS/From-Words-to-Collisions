At t=0.9s, the ego vehicle is at (523.5206, -1449.1458) with a velocity of 5.9381 m/s and acceleration of -2.6134 m/sÂ². Let's analyze the risk posed by each obstacle:

* **Obstacle 30618:** Located in lanelet 381, this obstacle is significantly behind and to the left of the ego vehicle, posing no immediate threat. It's moving faster than the ego vehicle and is likely overtaking on the adjacent lane.  Risk: **Negligible (5)**

* **Obstacle 30619:** Also in lanelet 381, this obstacle is to the left of the ego vehicle. Given the lateral separation and the current trajectories, a collision is unlikely. Risk: **Low (4)**

* **Obstacle 30620:** This obstacle is in lanelet 1111, positioned diagonally ahead and to the right of the ego vehicle. The lateral distance appears safe, and there is no immediate danger of collision. Risk: **Medium (3)**

* **Obstacle 30621:** Situated in lanelet 1112, this obstacle is to the right of the ego vehicle, and slightly ahead. Considering the lateral separation, orientations, and current velocities, the risk of collision is low. Risk: **Low (4)**

None of the obstacles pose an extreme or immediate collision risk.
