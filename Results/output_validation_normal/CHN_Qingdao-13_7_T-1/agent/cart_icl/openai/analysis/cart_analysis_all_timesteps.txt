### Analysis

At the latest timestamp (0.9 seconds), let's evaluate the relative positions and movements of the obstacles compared to the Ego vehicle:

**Ego Vehicle at 0.9s:**
- Position: (523.5206, -1449.1458)
- Velocity: 5.9381
- Acceleration: -2.6134

**Obstacle 30618:**
- Position: (500.7351, -1454.6186)
- Velocity: 14.4636
- Relative Longitudinal Position: -22.7855m (behind Ego)
- Relative Longitudinal Velocity: 8.5255m/s (approaching)
- TTC: -22.7855 / 8.5255 ≈ -2.67s (approaching from behind)
- Lateral distance: 5.4728m

**Obstacle 30619:**
- Position: (522.1604, -1445.9288)
- Velocity: 11.9209
- Relative Longitudinal Position: -1.3602m (behind Ego)
- Relative Longitudinal Velocity: 5.9828m/s (approaching)
- TTC: -1.3602 / 5.9828 ≈ -0.23s
- Lateral distance: 3.217m
- **Risk: Extreme (1)** because they are in the same lanelet and closing extremely fast.

**Obstacle 30620:**
- Position: (541.577, -1448.1638)
- Velocity: 7.2686
- Relative Longitudinal Position: 18.0564m (ahead of Ego)
- Relative Longitudinal Velocity: 1.3305m/s (moving slightly faster)
- TTC: Positive, and they diverge
- Lateral distance: 0.982m

**Obstacle 30621:**
- Position: (536.359, -1435.8088)
- Velocity: 7.4482
- Relative Longitudinal Position: 12.8384m  (ahead and to the side)
- Relative Longitudinal Velocity: 1.5101m/s
- Lateral distance: 13.337m

**Risk Assessment and Output:**

- **Obstacle 30619** has an extreme risk due to the rapid closing distance and they share a lanelet, indicating a collision course if no actions are taken by the Ego vehicle.
