At t=0.9s, Obstacle 30619 is closest to the ego vehicle with a longitudinal distance of 0.0m and a lateral distance of 1.88m. This indicates a very close proximity, especially longitudinally. While the lateral distance suggests some separation, the fact that the obstacle and ego vehicle are essentially aligned longitudinally represents a high risk of collision.  Obstacle 30621 is also relatively close at a longitudinal distance of 12.41m and lateral distance of 5.91 m. This obstacle is less concerning than 30619 in the immediate timeframe, but its continued lateral movement towards the ego vehicle warrants attention.
