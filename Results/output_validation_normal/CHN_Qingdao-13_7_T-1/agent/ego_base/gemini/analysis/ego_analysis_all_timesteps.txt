At t=0.9s:
- Obstacle 30618: Rear-left, moving away from ego, negligible risk.
- Obstacle 30619: Left, aligned longitudinally with ego, lateral distance 1.88m, relative longitudinal velocity -17.86 m/s.  High risk of collision.
- Obstacle 30620: Front-right, 12.59m longitudinal distance, moving away laterally, medium risk.
- Obstacle 30621: Front-left, 12.41m longitudinal distance,  approaching laterally, medium risk.

Obstacle 30619 poses a high risk due to its longitudinal alignment with the ego and high closing speed while only being 1.88 meters away laterally. This suggests a likely lane change maneuver by the obstacle or the ego vehicle's potential to drift into the adjacent lane.  Although the other obstacles are in relative proximity, their motion patterns do not suggest an imminent collision.
