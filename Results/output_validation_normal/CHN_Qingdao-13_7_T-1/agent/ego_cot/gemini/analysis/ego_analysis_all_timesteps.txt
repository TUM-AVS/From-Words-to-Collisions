### Safety analysis for timestep 0.9s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

**- Obstacle ID: 30618**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is moving away from the ego vehicle in the rear-left direction (DTClong: -18.66m, DTClat: -18.66m).
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason:  TTC is not applicable as the obstacle is moving away.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

**- Obstacle ID: 30619**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is at the same longitudinal position as the ego vehicle and slightly to the left (DTClong: 0.0m, DTClat: 0.0m). This indicates a very high risk of collision.
- Distance safety score: 0
- Time Risk reason: The provided data suggests the obstacle and ego vehicle are at the same position, implying a TTC of zero.
- Time safety score: 0
- Overall Risk score: 0

**- Obstacle ID: 30620**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is in front-right of the ego vehicle at a safe distance (DTClong: 12.59m, DTClat: 12.59m).
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: TTC needs more context to calculate, assuming a moderate relative longitudinal velocity, TTC is likely >2s. Lateral motion suggests divergence.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

**- Obstacle ID: 30621**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is in front-left of the ego vehicle at a moderate distance(DTClong: 12.41m, DTClat: 12.41m).
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason:  TTC needs more context, assuming a moderate relative longitudinal velocity, TTC might be around 1-2s. Lateral motion suggests convergence which could be a concern.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3
