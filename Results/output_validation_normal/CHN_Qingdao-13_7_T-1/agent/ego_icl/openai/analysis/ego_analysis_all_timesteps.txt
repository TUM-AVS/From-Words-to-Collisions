Let's analyze the obstacle data from the most recent timestep (0.9 seconds). We'll calculate the Time-to-Collision (TTC) and Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC) for each obstacle. The adjusted distances specified were not provided, so I'm assuming the raw distances for the calculation. If you have adjusted distances, you should replace the raw distance with them.

### Obstacle analysis:

#### Obstacle 30618:
- **Position**: Rear-left
- **Relative Distance**: Longitudinal: -18.66m, Lateral: 1.90m
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal: -20.40 m/s (moving away), Lateral: 0.01 m/s
- **Motion Description**: Obstacle is moving away longitudinally and laterally.
- **Analysis**: 
  - The obstacle is moving away from the ego vehicle. 
  - TTC for longitudinal: Not applicable, as distance is increasing.
  - MDC: Not relevant due to diverging paths.
- **Risk Score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)

#### Obstacle 30619:
- **Position**: Left
- **Relative Distance**: Longitudinal: 0.00m, Lateral: 1.88m
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal: -17.86 m/s, Lateral: 0.04 m/s
- **Motion Description**: Exact longitudinal alignment, moving away laterally.
- **Analysis**:
  - Longitudinal distance of 0.00m could indicate risk but depends on lateral distance.
  - Lateral distance is 1.88m which provides enough clearance.
  - TTC for lateral: 1.88m / 0.04 m/s = 47 seconds
  - MDC: Lateral 1.88m (if assuming minimal lateral collision path due to alignment).
- **Risk Score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)

#### Obstacle 30620:
- **Position**: Front-right
- **Relative Distance**: Longitudinal: 12.59m, Lateral: -4.28m
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal: -4.58 m/s, Lateral: -7.14 m/s
- **Motion Description**: Obstacle is driving toward the ego vehicle longitudinally and away laterally.
- **Analysis**: 
  - This obstacle is moving towards the ego car longitudinally, but moving away laterally.
  - TTC for longitudinal: 12.59m / 4.58 m/s = 2.75s
  - MDC: Given longitudinal alignment is a factor, considering trajectory may yield minimal overlap.
- **Risk Score**: 3 (Medium Risk)

#### Obstacle 30621:
- **Position**: Front-left
- **Relative Distance**: Longitudinal: 12.41m, Lateral: 5.91m
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal: -8.50 m/s, Lateral: -6.99 m/s
- **Motion Description**: Obstacle is driving toward the ego car both longitudinally and laterally.
- **Analysis**:
  - Movement towards the ego vehicle both forward and from side.
  - TTC for longitudinal: 12.41m / 8.50 m/s = 1.46s
  - MDC: Approaching diagonally; main concern is longitudinal.
- **Risk Score**: 3 (Medium Risk)

### Summary JSON:

```json
{
  "CollisionObstacle": {
    "ObstacleID": "NONE",
    "OverallRiskScore": "5"
  },
  "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {
    "ObstacleID": "NONE",
    "OverallRiskScore": "5"
  },
  "HighRiskObstacle": {
    "ObstacleID": "NONE",
    "OverallRiskScore": "5"
  }
}
```

In this scenario, no obstacles present a collision or extreme or high risk, based on the TTC and MDC assessments across the most recent timestep.
