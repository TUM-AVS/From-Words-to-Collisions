At t=0.9s, Ego is in lanelet 382.

Obstacle 30618 is in lanelet 381 and moving at a high velocity (14.46 m/s) towards Ego.  The y-coordinates are converging, indicating a potential lane change or unsafe maneuver by the obstacle. Lateral distance is small and decreasing. This represents an extreme risk.

Obstacle 30619 is also in lanelet 381 and moving with a high velocity (11.92 m/s). Lateral distance is larger than 30618, but the obstacle's trajectory and continued acceleration suggest that if 30618 does not collide, this obstacle might.  It's currently a high risk, not extreme.

Obstacle 30620 is in lanelet 1111 and moving slower. Given the current positions and trajectories, this obstacle is not a collision risk.

Obstacle 30621 is in lanelet 1112 and poses no immediate threat.
