At t=0.9s, Ego is in lanelet 382.

Obstacle 30618 is in lanelet 381 and moving at a high velocity (14.46 m/s) towards Ego's lanelet, with y-coordinate approaching Ego's.  Given the velocities and positions, a lane change by this obstacle could lead to an extreme risk scenario in the next few timesteps.

Obstacle 30619 is also in lanelet 381, and its y-coordinate is getting closer to Ego's.  While not as immediately concerning as 30618, it bears watching.

Obstacle 30620 is in lanelet 1111.  It does not appear to present an immediate risk.

Obstacle 30621 is in lanelet 1112 and also does not appear to present an immediate risk.

Since no obstacle is predicted to collide with Ego within the next time step at t=0.9s, no obstacle is assigned a risk score of 0 or 1.
