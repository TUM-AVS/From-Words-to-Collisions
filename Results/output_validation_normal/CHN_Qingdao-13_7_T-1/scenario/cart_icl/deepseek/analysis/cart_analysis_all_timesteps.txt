### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep (0.9 seconds):

### Obstacle Analysis:

#### Obstacle ID: 30618.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: Moving away from ego in lanelet 381.0 (parallel lane). Distance increasing over time (from ~5m to ~23m).
- **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- **Time Risk reason**: High relative velocity (14.46 m/s vs ego's 5.94 m/s) but moving in opposite direction.
- **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 30619.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: Approaching from front in parallel lane (lanelet 381.0). Distance decreasing (~13m to ~1.4m over 0.9s).
- **Distance safety score**: 2 (High Risk)
- **Time Risk reason**: High closing speed (11.92 m/s vs ego's 5.94 m/s). TTC ~0.12s.
- **Time safety score**: 1 (Extreme Risk)
- **Overall Risk score**: 1

#### Obstacle ID: 30620.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: Moving away in lanelet 1111.0 (crossing path). Distance increasing (~18m to ~22m).
- **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- **Time Risk reason**: Low relative velocity (7.27 m/s vs ego's 5.94 m/s) and diverging paths.
- **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 30621.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: Moving away in lanelet 1112.0. Distance increasing (~18m to ~20m).
- **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- **Time Risk reason**: Low relative velocity (7.45 m/s vs ego's 5.94 m/s) and diverging paths.
- **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. Ego is decelerating sharply (from 10.3 m/s to 5.94 m/s in 0.9s)
2. Obstacle 30619.0 is approaching rapidly from front in parallel lane with high closing speed
3. TTC with 30619.0 is critically low (~0.12s)
4. Other obstacles are moving away or on non-conflicting paths
5. No actual collision at current timestep, but extreme risk of imminent collision
