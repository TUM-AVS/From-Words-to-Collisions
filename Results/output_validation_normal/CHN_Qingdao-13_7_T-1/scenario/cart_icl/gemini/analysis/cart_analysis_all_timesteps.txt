### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 30616.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is laterally separated and moving away from ego vehicle.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason:  No time-based risk due to lateral separation and diverging trajectories.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5
- Obstacle ID: 30618.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is in a different lane and moving away from the ego vehicle, though initially close.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason:  Relative velocity and acceleration suggest no immediate risk, but monitoring needed due to initial proximity.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4
- Obstacle ID: 30619.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is in a different lane and moving away from the ego vehicle, though initially close.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason:  Relative velocity and acceleration suggest no immediate risk, but monitoring needed due to initial proximity.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4
- Obstacle ID: 30620.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is laterally separated and moving away from ego vehicle.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: No time-based risk due to separation and diverging trajectories.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5
- Obstacle ID: 30621.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is laterally separated and maintaining distance.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: No time-based risk due to separation and trajectories.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
No obstacle shows signs of imminent collision. All obstacles are either moving away from the ego vehicle or maintaining a safe lateral distance. Therefore, this is not a collision scenario.
