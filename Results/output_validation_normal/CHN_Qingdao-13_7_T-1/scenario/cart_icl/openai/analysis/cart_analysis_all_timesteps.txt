### Obstacle Analysis:

#### Obstacle ID: 30616.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: Obstacle 30616.0 is in a different lanelet (388.0) than the ego vehicle (382.0), and it has been consistently moving away in a parallel trajectory with increasing distance.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: Observing consistent acceleration and velocity, with no approach towards the ego vehicle over the past timesteps.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 30618.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: Obstacle 30618.0 is moving closer to the ego vehicle within the same lanelet (381.0) over time, with a decreasing lateral distance.
- **Distance safety score**: 3
- **Time Risk reason**: Increasing velocity and slight trajectory alignment with the ego vehicle pose increasing risk.
- **Time safety score**: 3
- **Overall Risk score**: 3

#### Obstacle ID: 30619.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: Obstacle 30619.0 is in the same lanelet (381.0) as a nearby obstacle, with a reducing distance towards the ego vehicle.
- **Distance safety score**: 2
- **Time Risk reason**: Accelerating with a trajectory towards the lane of the ego vehicle, posing a medium risk of potential collision.
- **Time safety score**: 2
- **Overall Risk score**: 2

#### Obstacle ID: 30620.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is in a different lanelet (1111.0). The movement pattern shows negligible overlap risk with the ego vehicle.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: Stable speeds and trajectories demonstrate negligible risk.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 30621.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: Trend indicates moving away in a different trajectory with no direct path crossing with the ego vehicle.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: Acceleration patterns are consistent with moving off pathway, decreasing interaction risks.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
The obstacle of most concern, Obstacle 30619.0, shares a similar trajectory with the ego vehicle and has a reducing gap, suggesting a potential medium risk collision if trends continue unchecked. However, no obstacles are immediately in the path of an unavoidable collision, thus no collision or extreme risk score is warranted at this time.
