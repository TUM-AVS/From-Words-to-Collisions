Obstacle 30619 is at a longitudinal distance of 0.0m and lateral distance of 1.88m relative to the ego vehicle.  While it is laterally offset, the zero longitudinal distance indicates a likely collision.

Obstacle 30621 is closing in on the ego vehicle both longitudinally (12.41m) and laterally (5.91m) with concerning negative relative velocities. Although not an immediate collision, the combined closing distance and motion present a high risk.
