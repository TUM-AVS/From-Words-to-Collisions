At t=0.9s, Obstacle 30619 is at the Left of the ego vehicle with a longitudinal distance of 0.0m and lateral distance of 1.88m. This implies it's right next to the ego vehicle. Although it appears to be moving away laterally, the small distance poses an extreme risk.  Obstacle 30621 is at the Front-left with a longitudinal distance of 12.41m and is approaching the ego vehicle both longitudinally and laterally. This presents a high risk, though not as immediate as 30619. Obstacles 30618 and 30620 are moving away and pose negligible risk.

        "IsCollisionScenario": false,
        "Reasoning": "Obstacle 30619 is extremely close laterally (1.88m) and longitudinally aligned (0.0m) with the ego vehicle, posing an extreme risk of collision. Although no collision is guaranteed in the next timestep, the proximity necessitates classifying this obstacle as extremely high risk."
