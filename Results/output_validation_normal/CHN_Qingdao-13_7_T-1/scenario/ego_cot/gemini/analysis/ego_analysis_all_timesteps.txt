### Safety analysis for timestep 0.9 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

It's crucial to note that the provided scenario description lacks crucial information for accurate TTC and MDC calculation.  We are missing the ego vehicle's speed and acceleration.  Furthermore, "adjusted distances" are mentioned but not provided.  Therefore, the analysis below is based on relative motion trends and distance approximations, making it a qualitative assessment rather than a precise quantitative one.

### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 30618**
- Distance Risk reason: Located in the Rear-left and moving away from the ego vehicle both longitudinally and laterally (-18.66m, -18.66m).
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason:  Moving away from the ego vehicle; no TTC concern.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 30619**
- Distance Risk reason:  At virtually zero distance (0.00m, 0.00m), indicating extreme proximity. Though slightly to the left, this poses an immediate collision risk.
- Distance safety score: 1
- Time Risk reason:  While slightly moving left, its longitudinal relative velocity is high, indicating a near-instantaneous collision.
- Time safety score: 1
- Overall Risk score: 1

- **Obstacle ID: 30620**
- Distance Risk reason:  Located Front-right at a moderate distance (12.59m, 12.59m) and moving laterally away.  However, it's approaching longitudinally.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: Without ego vehicle speed, TTC is uncertain, but longitudinal approach needs monitoring.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3

- **Obstacle ID: 30621**
- Distance Risk reason: Located Front-left at a moderate distance (12.41m, 12.41m) and moving laterally toward the ego vehicle. Also approaching longitudinally.
- Distance safety score: 2
- Time Risk reason:  Without ego vehicle speed, TTC is uncertain, but both longitudinal and lateral movement towards the ego warrants attention.
- Time safety score: 2
- Overall Risk score: 2



### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
  "CollisionObstacle": null,
  "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {
    "ObstacleID": "30619",
    "OverallRiskScore": "1"
  },
  "IsCollisionScenario": false,
  "Justification": "Obstacle 30619 shows an extremely high risk with a distance of approximately zero, posing an immediate collision risk despite some lateral movement away from the ego-vehicle's path. No collision is confirmed at this timestep, but a collision in the immediate future is extremely likely."
