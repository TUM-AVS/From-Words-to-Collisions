Let's analyze the obstacles at the most recent timestep (0.9 seconds) and determine the risk assessments using the adjusted distances and velocities.

### Obstacle-by-Obstacle Analysis:

**Obstacle 30618:**
- Position: Rear-left
- Adjusted Distances: Longitudinal = -18.66 m, Lateral = 1.90 m
- Relative Velocity: Longitudinal = -20.40 m/s (moving away), Lateral = 0.01 m/s (negligible movement)
- Motion: Moving away longitudinally and laterally
- **Analysis**:
  - This obstacle is moving away, indicating no collision course.
  - **MDC**: 18.66 m (based on longitudinal distance)
  - **TTC**: Not applicable (moving away)
  - **Risk Score**: 5 (No Risk)

**Obstacle 30619:**
- Position: Left
- Adjusted Distances: Longitudinal = 0.00 m, Lateral = 1.88 m
- Relative Velocity: Longitudinal = -17.86 m/s, Lateral = 0.04 m/s
- Motion: Exact longitudinal alignment, moving laterally away
- **Analysis**:
  - Despite the exact alignment longitudinally, the lateral distance prevents a collision.
  - **MDC**: 1.88 m (based on lateral distance)
  - **TTC**: ≈ 0.11 s (longitudinal; using |0.00/17.86| is undefined, but not a collision as lateral is greater)
  - **Risk Score**: 3 (Medium Risk) due to MDC proximity

**Obstacle 30620:**
- Position: Front-right
- Adjusted Distances: Longitudinal = 12.59 m, Lateral = -4.28 m
- Relative Velocity: Longitudinal = -4.58 m/s, Lateral = -7.14 m/s
- **Analysis**:
  - The obstacle moves toward the ego vehicle, but distances suggest no imminent collision.
  - **MDC**: 12.59 m 
  - **TTC (Longitudinal)**: ≈ 2.75 s (potential risk, but not immediate)
  - **TTC (Lateral)**: Not critical, since lateral distance is moving outward
  - **Risk Score**: 5 (No Risk) due to sufficient distance for maneuvering

**Obstacle 30621:**
- Position: Front-left
- Adjusted Distances: Longitudinal = 12.41 m, Lateral = 5.91 m
- Relative Velocity: Longitudinal = -8.50 m/s, Lateral = -6.99 m/s
- Motion: Driving towards both longitudinally and laterally
- **Analysis**:
  - Moves towards the ego vehicle in both dimensions, indicating converging paths.
  - **MDC**: 12.41 m (since lateral distance does not suggest immediate collision risk)
  - **TTC (Longitudinal)**: ≈ 1.46 s
  - **TTC (Lateral)**: ≈ 0.85 s (high potential collision risk if paths remain unchanged)
  - **Risk Score**: 2 (High Risk) mainly due to lateral potential collision path

### Concluding Analysis:
No obstacle is on a direct collision course (score of 0), but Obstacle 30621 implies high risk due to converging trajectories close to the ego vehicle.
