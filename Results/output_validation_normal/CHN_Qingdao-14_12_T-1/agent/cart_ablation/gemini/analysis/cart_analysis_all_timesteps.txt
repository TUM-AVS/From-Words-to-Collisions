Obstacle 30670 is consistently behind the ego vehicle and its x-coordinate is decreasing at a faster rate than the ego vehicle, indicating a diverging trajectory.  Obstacle 30672 is ahead of the ego vehicle, and while its x-coordinate is increasing slower than the ego vehicle, the difference in their y-coordinates is also decreasing. This suggests a possible closing trajectory, but the separation is still significant over the short prediction horizon. There is no imminent collision risk.
