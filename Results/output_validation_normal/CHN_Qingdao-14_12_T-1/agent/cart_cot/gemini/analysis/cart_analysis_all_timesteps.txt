At t=0.9s, the ego vehicle at (-36.37, -2375.08) is moving with a velocity of 19.43 and an acceleration of -0.28. We need to analyze its interaction with three obstacles:

* **Obstacle 30647:** Located at (-48.61, -2396.41) in lanelet 134, moving with velocity 13.58 and acceleration -0.38. This obstacle appears to be on a different lanelet and poses no immediate threat.  The substantial difference in Y coordinates also mitigates risk. We categorize this as Negligible Risk.

* **Obstacle 30670:** Located at (-51.73, -2394.72) in the same lanelet (133) as the ego vehicle, moving with velocity 17.02 and acceleration -3.84. This obstacle is behind the ego vehicle in terms of their Y coordinates, meaning the ego vehicle is ahead.  Although they are in the same lanelet, the obstacle's negative acceleration suggests it's slowing down, further reducing risk.  However, the X coordinates are relatively close, warranting monitoring. We categorize this as Low Risk.

* **Obstacle 30672:** Located at (-18.78, -2360.55) in the same lanelet (133), moving with velocity 16.33 and acceleration -1.99. This obstacle is ahead of the ego vehicle based on the Y coordinate and significantly to the right based on X.  It does not pose an immediate collision risk. We categorize this as Negligible Risk.

**Calculations (Approximate based on provided data):**

While precise TTC and MDC calculations require more sophisticated models accounting for the non-linear nature of movement and orientation, we can make rough estimates:

* **Ego vs. Obstacle 30670:**  The difference in Y is roughly 19.67.  With the ego vehicle's higher velocity, the gap is likely increasing. This supports the Low Risk assessment.

* **Ego vs. Obstacle 30672:** The difference in Y is roughly 14.53 and X is 17.59. With the ego vehicle's faster speed and the obstacle's negative acceleration, this gap will likely increase. This supports the Negligible Risk assessment.

**Conclusion:**

At the current timestep (0.9s), no obstacle presents an immediate collision risk. The most important obstacle to monitor is 30670, which is in the same lane and behind but with closing X coordinate although receding Y coordinate.  The other obstacles are either on different lanelets or have trajectories diverging from the ego vehicle.
