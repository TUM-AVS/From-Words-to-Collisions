At t=0.9s, the ego vehicle is at (-36.37, -2375.08) with a velocity of 19.43 m/s and an orientation of -2.35 radians.  Let's analyze the risk posed by each obstacle:

* **Obstacle 30647:** This obstacle is in a different lanelet (134) than the ego vehicle (133).  While its position (-48.61, -2396.41) is somewhat close to the ego vehicle, the lateral separation suggests a low risk of collision. Further analysis using precise lanelet boundaries and obstacle dimensions would be beneficial to confirm this, but given the available data, we assess the risk as low.

* **Obstacle 30670:** Located at (-51.73, -2394.72) in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle.  This obstacle is behind the ego vehicle and its velocity (17.02 m/s) is lower than the ego's.  This indicates a likely overtaking scenario.  A simple TTC calculation, considering only longitudinal motion, might not be sufficient, but a quick check shows relative velocity as negative, which translates to an increasing inter-vehicle distance. Hence the risk of collision is low.


* **Obstacle 30672:** This obstacle is at (-18.78, -2360.55), also in the same lanelet as the ego. It is ahead of the ego vehicle and moving slower (16.33 m/s).  The closing velocity is positive, which indicates the inter-vehicle distance is shrinking. This situation warrants a closer look.

A more detailed analysis, incorporating lateral movement and obstacle dimensions, would be required for a definitive risk assessment. However, based on the provided data, obstacle 30672 shows the highest potential for collision, with obstacle 30670 and 30647 representing lower risk levels due to higher longitudinal and lateral separations.
