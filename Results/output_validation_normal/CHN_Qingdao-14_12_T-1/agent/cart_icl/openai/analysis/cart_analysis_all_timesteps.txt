At the most recent timestep (0.9 seconds), we evaluate the positions and movements of the obstacles relative to the ego vehicle:

### Obstacle Analysis:

1. **Obstacle 30670.0:**
   - **Position**: (-51.7322, -2394.7211)
   - **Orientation**: -2.2363
   - **Velocity**: 17.0203
   - **Acceleration**: -3.8445
   - **Relative Position to Ego**:
     - Longitudinal: The obstacle is approximately 15.3 meters behind the ego (since Ego is at (-36.3702, -2375.0831)).
   - **TTC Calculation**:
     - Relative longitudinal velocity: Ego is faster by 2.4064 m/s (19.4267 - 17.0203).
     - TTC = 15.3 / 2.4064 = Approximately 6.36 seconds.
     - Lateral distance = Approximately 19.64 meters.
   - **Risk Assessment**: The obstacle is well behind with ample time and distance, indicating no immediate risk. **Negligible risk (5).**

2. **Obstacle 30672.0:**
   - **Position**: (-18.7759, -2360.5463)
   - **Orientation**: -2.5067
   - **Velocity**: 16.3339
   - **Acceleration**: -1.9868
   - **Relative Position to Ego**:
     - Longitudinal: The obstacle is approximately 22.05 meters ahead of the Ego vehicle.
   - **TTC Calculation**:
     - Relative longitudinal velocity: Ego is faster by 3.0928 m/s (19.4267 - 16.3339).
     - TTC = 22.05 / 3.0928 = Approximately 7.13 seconds.
     - Lateral distance is safe for current trajectories.
   - **Risk Assessment**: Good time and distance buffer; no immediate collision risk. **Negligible risk (5).**

3. **Obstacle 30647.0:**
   - **Position**: (-48.6102, -2396.411)
   - **Orientation**: 0.9053 (different lanelet)
   - **Velocity**: 13.5791
   - **Acceleration**: -0.3848
   - **Relative Position to Ego**:
     - Longitudinal and lateral: Not directly involved with the ego's current path and lanelet, thus not an immediate threat.
   - **Risk Assessment**: Located in a different lanelet, the trajectory doesn't indicate an immediate intersection with the ego's path. **Negligible risk (5).**

All observed obstacles in the most recent timestep do not pose an immediate collision threat based on their positions, velocities, accelerations, and TTC/MDC calculations.
