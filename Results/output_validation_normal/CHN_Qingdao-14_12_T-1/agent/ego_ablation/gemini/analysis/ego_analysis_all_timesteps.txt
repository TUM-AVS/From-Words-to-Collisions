At t=0.9s, Obstacle 30647 poses an extreme risk. It's located in the front-left (19.24m longitudinal, 4.77m lateral), rapidly approaching longitudinally (-32.91 m/s) and slightly moving towards the ego laterally (-1.60 m/s).  Given the high closing velocity and proximity, a collision is highly likely unless immediate evasive action is taken.

Obstacle 30670 and 30672 do not pose an immediate threat. Obstacle 30670 is moving away laterally, mitigating the longitudinal closing speed. Obstacle 30672 is moving away from the ego vehicle both longitudinally and laterally.
