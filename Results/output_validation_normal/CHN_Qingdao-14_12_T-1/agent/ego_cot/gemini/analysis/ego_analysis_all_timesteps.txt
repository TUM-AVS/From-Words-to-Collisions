### Safety analysis for timestep 0.9s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

**- Obstacle ID: 30647**
- Distance Risk reason:  Obstacle 30647 is located at 19.24m longitudinally and laterally, which is relatively close, and approaching rapidly in the front-left of the ego vehicle (-32.91 m/s longitudinal velocity).  This indicates a very high risk of collision in the near future.
- Distance safety score: 2
- Time Risk reason: The high closing velocity (-32.91 m/s) suggests a very short time to collision.
- Time safety score: 1
- Overall Risk score: 1

**- Obstacle ID: 30670**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 30670 is located at 20.25m longitudinally and laterally in the front-left of the ego vehicle.  While it is moving away laterally, it is approaching longitudinally at -2.52 m/s.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: The closing longitudinal velocity indicates a moderate time to collision, but the lateral movement reduces the immediate risk.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3

**- Obstacle ID: 30672**
- Distance Risk reason: Located at -18.21m longitudinally and laterally, indicating it's behind the ego vehicle and moving further away. This poses no immediate collision risk.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason:  The negative longitudinal velocity confirms that it's moving away from the ego vehicle.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5
