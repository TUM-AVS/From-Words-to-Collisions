### Obstacle-by-Obstacle Analysis:

#### **Obstacle 30647 (Front-left)**
- **Adjusted Distance**: Longitudinal 19.24 m, Lateral 4.77 m  
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal -32.91 m/s (approaching rapidly), Lateral -1.60 m/s (approaching from left)  
- **Motion**: Driving toward ego longitudinally and laterally from the left.  
- **Trajectory Analysis**:  
  - Longitudinal distance decreases rapidly (from 22.27m to 19.24m in 0.1s).  
  - Lateral distance decreases (from 5.96m to 4.77m in 0.1s).  
  - High closing speed longitudinally (-32.91 m/s).  

- **TTC Calculation**:  
  - Longitudinal TTC = 19.24 / 32.91 ≈ 0.58s (High Risk)  
  - Lateral TTC = 4.77 / 1.60 ≈ 2.98s (Medium Risk)  
  - **Overall TTC Risk**: High (0.58s)  

- **MDC Calculation**:  
  - Since both distances are decreasing, focus on the smaller TTC (longitudinal).  
  - Projected MDC: If current deceleration continues, collision is imminent.  
  - **MDC Risk**: High (closing rapidly).  

- **Overall Risk**: **High Risk (2)** due to rapid longitudinal approach.

#### **Obstacle 30670 (Front-left)**
- **Adjusted Distance**: Longitudinal 20.25 m, Lateral 1.36 m  
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal -2.52 m/s (approaching), Lateral 2.00 m/s (moving away left)  
- **Motion**: Driving toward ego longitudinally but moving away laterally.  
- **Trajectory Analysis**:  
  - Longitudinal distance slowly decreasing (from 20.37m to 20.25m).  
  - Lateral distance increasing (from 2.12m to 1.36m).  

- **TTC Calculation**:  
  - Longitudinal TTC = 20.25 / 2.52 ≈ 8.04s (No Risk)  
  - Lateral TTC: Not applicable (moving away).  
  - **Overall TTC Risk**: No Risk (5).  

- **MDC Calculation**:  
  - Lateral distance is increasing, so no collision risk.  
  - **MDC Risk**: No Risk (5).  

- **Overall Risk**: **No Risk (5)**.

#### **Obstacle 30672 (Rear-left)**
- **Adjusted Distance**: Longitudinal -18.21 m (behind), Lateral 0.60 m  
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal -3.28 m/s (moving away), Lateral -2.48 m/s (approaching from left)  
- **Motion**: Moving away longitudinally but approaching laterally.  
- **Trajectory Analysis**:  
  - Longitudinal distance increasing (moving away).  
  - Lateral distance decreasing (from 0.00m to 0.60m in 0.1s).  

- **TTC Calculation**:  
  - Longitudinal TTC: Not applicable (moving away).  
  - Lateral TTC = 0.60 / 2.48 ≈ 0.24s (Extreme Risk).  
  - **Overall TTC Risk**: Extreme (0.24s).  

- **MDC Calculation**:  
  - Lateral distance is small (0.60m) and closing rapidly.  
  - **MDC Risk**: Extreme (0.60m with closing velocity).  

- **Overall Risk**: **Extreme Risk (1)** due to imminent lateral collision.
