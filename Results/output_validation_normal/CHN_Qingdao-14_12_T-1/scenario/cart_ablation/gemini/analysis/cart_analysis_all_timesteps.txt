At t=0.9s, Ego is at (-36.37, -2375.08) in lanelet 133.

Obstacle 30670 is at (-51.73, -2394.72) in lanelet 133.  While this obstacle is behind the ego vehicle and also in the same lanelet, the trajectories suggest a possible future collision if obstacle 30670 maintains its higher velocity and the ego vehicle continues decelerating. It represents a high risk but not extreme as there is still time to react.

Obstacle 30672 is at (-18.78, -2360.55) in lanelet 133. This obstacle is ahead of the ego vehicle and in the same lanelet. The distance between them is decreasing but the relative velocities suggest they might not collide in the very next timestep. This represents a potential high risk depending on future deceleration but not extreme at this moment.

Obstacle 30647 is at (-48.61, -2396.41) in lanelet 134. Although spatially close to the ego vehicle, it is in a different lanelet, suggesting a low immediate risk.
