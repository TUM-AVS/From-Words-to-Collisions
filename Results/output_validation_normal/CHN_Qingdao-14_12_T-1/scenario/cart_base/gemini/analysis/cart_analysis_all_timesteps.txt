At t=0.9s, Ego is at (-36.37, -2375.08) in lanelet 133.

Obstacle 30647 is at (-48.61, -2396.41) in lanelet 134.  This obstacle is in a different lanelet and poses no immediate risk.

Obstacle 30670 is at (-51.73, -2394.72) in lanelet 133. While in the same lanelet, it's significantly behind Ego and decelerating, posing no immediate risk.

Obstacle 30672 is at (-18.78, -2360.55) in lanelet 133.  This obstacle is ahead of Ego and in the same lanelet. While the distance is not extremely close, the trajectory information from preceding timesteps doesn't suggest an immediate collision is unavoidable. Further monitoring is needed, but it doesn't reach an "extreme risk" threshold based on the current information.

    "Reasoning": "No obstacle presents an immediate collision risk at t=0.9s. All obstacles are either in a different lanelet or sufficiently far behind/ahead to avoid immediate collision based on current trajectory information."
