### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep:

### Obstacle Analysis:
1. **Obstacle ID: 30647.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Located in lanelet 134.0, which is adjacent to the ego's lanelet (133.0). The obstacle is moving away from the ego vehicle based on historical positions.
   - **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: The obstacle's velocity (13.5791) is significantly lower than the ego's (19.4267), and it is decelerating (-0.3848). No immediate collision risk.
   - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)

2. **Obstacle ID: 30670.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Located in the same lanelet (133.0) as the ego vehicle. The obstacle is ahead of the ego and maintaining a consistent distance (~15-20 units) over time.
   - **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: The obstacle is decelerating (-3.8445) and its velocity (17.0203) is lower than the ego's (19.4267). The relative velocity is decreasing, reducing collision risk.
   - **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low Risk)

3. **Obstacle ID: 30672.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Located in the same lanelet (133.0) as the ego vehicle. The obstacle is behind the ego and the distance is increasing over time.
   - **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: The obstacle's velocity (16.3339) is lower than the ego's (19.4267), and it is decelerating (-1.9868). No collision risk.
   - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. **Obstacle 30647.0**: Not in the same lanelet and moving away. No risk.
2. **Obstacle 30670.0**: In the same lanelet but maintaining a safe distance and decelerating. Low risk.
3. **Obstacle 30672.0**: In the same lanelet but behind and moving away. No risk.
4. **Conclusion**: No collision or extreme risk obstacles. The scenario is safe.
