### Obstacle Analysis:

#### Obstacle ID: 30647.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is in a different lanelet (134) and with a consistent separation from Ego in lanelet 133. Over the observed timeframe, it maintains a steady trajectory parallel to Ego's path at a safe distance.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: Maintains a steady velocity and orientation, with no significant acceleration changes, indicating stability and predictability in movement.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 30649.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: Similar to 30647.0, it is in lanelet 134 and on a stable path parallel and away from Ego, indicating no imminent collision risk.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: Stable velocity and mild acceleration align with a consistent, safe trajectory.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 30650.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: Stationary in lanelet 451, consistently distant from Ego's path over all timesteps.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: Zero velocity and acceleration over time ensure there's no threat.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 30651.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: Located in a non-conflicting lanelet (131) with no intersection with Ego's trajectory.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: Stable speed and path, no interaction with Ego's lane over observed timeframes.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 30668.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: Continuing through lanelet 133, initially in front of Ego. Moving away, indicated by consistent positional progression and deceleration.
- **Distance safety score**: 4
- **Time Risk reason**: Decreasing velocity indicates itâ€™s decelerating, increasing separational metrics from Ego.
- **Time safety score**: 4
- **Overall Risk score**: 4

#### Obstacle ID: 30669.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: Present in lanelet 133 with initial approach but stabilized at a distance with no collision risk.
- **Distance safety score**: 4
- **Time Risk reason**: Deceleration reduces potential collision in subsequent timeframes.
- **Time safety score**: 4
- **Overall Risk score**: 4

#### Obstacle ID: 30670.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: Sharing lanelet 133, initially in front but moving at a relatively higher speed, increasing distance over time.
- **Distance safety score**: 4
- **Time Risk reason**: Consistent velocity and positioning counsel against any collision concern for the current state.
- **Time safety score**: 4
- **Overall Risk score**: 4

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
The analysis over the timesteps reveals no collisions due to stable distances and velocities between Ego and other obstacles, despite some sharing or intersecting trajectories.
