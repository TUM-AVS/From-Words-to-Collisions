Obstacle 30647 suddenly appears at 0.8 seconds with a high longitudinal closing velocity (-32.88 m/s) and a relatively close longitudinal distance (22.27 m).  At 0.9 seconds, it's even closer (19.24 m) and still closing fast (-32.91 m/s). This represents an extreme risk. While its lateral velocity suggests it is moving towards the ego vehicle (-1.60 m/s), the lateral distance (4.77m) provides a small margin but given the high longitudinal closing speed, an immediate and decisive maneuver is needed to avoid collision.

Obstacle 30670 consistently maintains a safe lateral distance and although it has a negative longitudinal velocity, it's relatively low. Obstacle 30672 is moving away from the ego vehicle and therefore poses no risk.
