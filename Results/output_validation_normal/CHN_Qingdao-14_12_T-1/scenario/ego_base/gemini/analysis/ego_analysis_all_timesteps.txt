At t=0.9s, Obstacle 30647 is rapidly approaching the ego vehicle longitudinally (-32.91 m/s) and laterally (-1.60 m/s) from the front-left, with a longitudinal distance of 19.24m and lateral distance of 4.77m. This represents an extreme risk of collision.

Obstacle 30670 is also in the front-left, but at a safer longitudinal distance (20.25m) and moving laterally away from the ego vehicle. While it is approaching longitudinally (-2.52 m/s), the risk is less immediate than 30647.

Obstacle 30672 is behind the ego vehicle and moving away longitudinally. It poses no immediate threat.

Due to the high closing speed of Obstacle 30647, this is considered a high-risk scenario with a high probability of collision in the near future.
