### Safety analysis for timestep 0.9 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 30647**
- Distance Risk reason:  This obstacle is located in the Front-left at 19.24m longitudinally and laterally.  Although the lateral motion suggests it's moving slightly towards the ego vehicle, the high closing speed longitudinally (-32.91 m/s) poses the most significant risk. It's rapidly approaching the ego vehicle.
- Distance safety score: 2 (High Risk)
- Time Risk reason:  The high closing velocity results in a very short TTC.  Even though the lateral movement isn't extremely concerning, the longitudinal approach is very rapid.
- Time safety score: 1 (Extreme Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 1 (Extreme Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 30670**
- Distance Risk reason: Located Front-left at 20.25m longitudinally and laterally. The lateral movement is away from the ego vehicle, reducing risk in that direction. However, it is slowly approaching longitudinally (-2.52 m/s).
- Distance safety score: 3 (Medium Risk)
- Time Risk reason: The longitudinal closing velocity is relatively slow, suggesting a moderate TTC. The lateral motion further decreases collision risk.
- Time safety score: 3 (Medium Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 3 (Medium Risk)


- **Obstacle ID: 30672**
- Distance Risk reason:  Located Rear-left at -18.21m longitudinally and laterally.  Both longitudinal and lateral movement indicate this obstacle is moving away from the ego vehicle.
- Distance safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- Time Risk reason:  The relative motion clearly indicates increasing separation, resulting in no foreseeable collision risk.
- Time safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 5 (Negligible Risk)


### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
  "CollisionObstacle": null,
  "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {
    "ObstacleID": "30647",
    "OverallRiskScore": "1"
  },
  "IsCollisionScenario": false,
  "Justification": "Obstacle 30647 poses an extreme risk due to its high longitudinal closing velocity and proximity, although a collision isn't guaranteed in the next immediate moment. No obstacle shows certain collision within the predicted timeframe."
