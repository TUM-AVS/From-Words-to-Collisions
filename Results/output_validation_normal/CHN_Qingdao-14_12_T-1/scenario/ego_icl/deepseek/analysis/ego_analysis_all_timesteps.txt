### Obstacle-by-Obstacle Analysis (Most Recent Timestep: 0.9s)

#### **Obstacle 30647 (Front-left)**
- **Adjusted Distance**: Longitudinal 19.24m, Lateral 4.77m  
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal -32.91 m/s (approaching rapidly), Lateral -1.60 m/s (approaching from left)  
- **Motion**: Driving toward ego longitudinally and laterally from left  
- **TTC (Longitudinal)**: 19.24 / 32.91 ≈ 0.58s  
- **TTC (Lateral)**: 4.77 / 1.60 ≈ 2.98s  
- **MDC**: Lateral distance (4.77m) is primary since longitudinal closing is extreme.  
- **Risk**:  
  - Longitudinal TTC (0.58s) → High Risk (2)  
  - Lateral TTC (2.98s) → Medium Risk (3)  
  - MDC (4.77m) → Low Risk (4)  
- **Overall Risk**: **High Risk (2)** (prioritize longitudinal TTC)  

#### **Obstacle 30670 (Front-left)**
- **Adjusted Distance**: Longitudinal 20.25m, Lateral 1.36m  
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal -2.52 m/s (approaching), Lateral 2.00 m/s (moving away left)  
- **Motion**: Driving toward ego longitudinally but moving away laterally.  
- **TTC (Longitudinal)**: 20.25 / 2.52 ≈ 8.04s (No Risk)  
- **TTC (Lateral)**: N/A (moving away)  
- **MDC**: Lateral distance (1.36m) → Medium Risk (3)  
- **Risk**:  
  - Longitudinal: No Risk (5)  
  - Lateral: Medium Risk (3)  
- **Overall Risk**: **Medium Risk (3)**  

#### **Obstacle 30672 (Rear-left)**
- **Adjusted Distance**: Longitudinal -18.21m (behind), Lateral 0.60m  
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal -3.28 m/s (moving away), Lateral -2.48 m/s (approaching from left)  
- **Motion**: Moving away longitudinally but approaching laterally.  
- **TTC (Longitudinal)**: N/A (moving away)  
- **TTC (Lateral)**: 0.60 / 2.48 ≈ 0.24s  
- **MDC**: Lateral distance (0.60m) → High Risk (2)  
- **Risk**:  
  - Lateral TTC (0.24s) → Extreme Risk (1)  
  - MDC (0.60m) → High Risk (2)  
- **Overall Risk**: **Extreme Risk (1)** (prioritize TTC)

### Trajectory Analysis
- **Obstacle 30647**: Rapid longitudinal closing (-32.91 m/s) but lateral motion is slow. Likely to pass in front of ego.  
- **Obstacle 30670**: Slowly approaching longitudinally but moving away laterally. Minimal risk.  
- **Obstacle 30672**: Moving away longitudinally but laterally closing at high speed (TTC 0.24s). Critical risk of side collision.  

---

### Collision Scenario Determination
- **Obstacle 30672** has **Extreme Risk (1)** due to:  
  - Lateral TTC = 0.24s (< 0.5s)  
  - MDC = 0.60m (< 1.0m)  
  - Converging trajectory (lateral velocity toward ego).
