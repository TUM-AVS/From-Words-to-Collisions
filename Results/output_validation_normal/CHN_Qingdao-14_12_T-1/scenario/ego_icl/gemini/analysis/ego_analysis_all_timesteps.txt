* **Obstacle 30647:**

    * **Trajectory:** This obstacle appears suddenly at t=0.8s in the front-left of the ego vehicle.  It's approaching rapidly in the longitudinal direction and slightly in the lateral direction. The high negative longitudinal velocity (-32.91 m/s) and decreasing longitudinal distance suggest a high risk of collision.

    * **TTC (Longitudinal):** 19.24m / 32.91 m/s ≈ 0.58s
    * **TTC (Lateral):** 4.77m / 1.60 m/s ≈ 2.98s

    * **MDC:** The rapid longitudinal approach makes longitudinal distance the primary concern. Therefore, MDC ≈ 4.77m (lateral distance).

    * **Risk Assessment:**
        * Longitudinal: TTC of 0.58s indicates Extreme Risk (1).
        * Lateral: TTC of 2.98s suggests a Medium Risk (3) and MDC of 4.77m suggests a Low Risk (4).

    * **Overall Risk:** Extreme Risk (1) due to the very short TTC longitudinally.

* **Obstacle 30670:**

    * **Trajectory:**  Consistently in the front-left, initially moving away laterally but approaching longitudinally. However, the longitudinal closing speed is relatively low, and lateral motion is away from the ego vehicle.

    * **TTC (Longitudinal):** 20.25m / 2.52 m/s ≈ 8.04s
    * **TTC (Lateral):** 1.36m / 2.00 m/s ≈ 0.68s

    * **MDC:** The low lateral distance despite diverging lateral motion suggests MDC ≈ 1.36m.

    * **Risk Assessment:**
        * Longitudinal: TTC of 8.04s indicates No Risk (5).
        * Lateral: TTC of 0.68s suggests a High Risk (2), but the diverging lateral velocity and increasing lateral distance mitigate this to some extent. MDC of 1.36 suggests Medium Risk (3).

    * **Overall Risk:** Medium Risk (3) - lateral proximity requires monitoring despite the diverging lateral velocity, longitudinal motion is non-threatening.

* **Obstacle 30672:**

    * **Trajectory:**  Initially directly behind the ego vehicle and moving away. At t=0.9s it's still moving away longitudinally but slightly towards the ego laterally, though starting from a zero lateral position. The key is it is moving away longitudinally consistently.

    * **TTC (Longitudinal):** Not applicable as the obstacle is moving away longitudinally.
    * **TTC (Lateral):** 0.60m / 2.48 m/s ≈ 0.24s

    * **MDC:** The lateral distance being very low, and the lateral TTC being under 0.5s, despite starting at 0.00 lateral offset and moving away longitudinally are signs of concern. MDC ≈ 0.60m.

    * **Risk Assessment:**
        * Longitudinal: No risk (5) as it's moving away.
        * Lateral:  High Risk (2) considering the lateral TTC and distance. Lateral movement toward the ego warrants a higher risk level despite the negative longitudinal velocity. MDC being less than 1m also contributes to this risk.

    * **Overall Risk:** High Risk (2) due to lateral motion and small lateral distance although longitudinally the vehicle is moving away.


* **Collision Scenario?**: Yes. Obstacle 30647 has an Extreme Risk (1) assessment due to the very low TTC (0.58s).
