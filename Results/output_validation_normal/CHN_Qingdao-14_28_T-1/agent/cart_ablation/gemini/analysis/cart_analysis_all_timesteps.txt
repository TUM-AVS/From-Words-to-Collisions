Obstacle 30667 is in the same lane as the ego vehicle (lanelet 133) and initially poses the greatest risk.  At t=0.1s, it's traveling significantly faster than the ego vehicle and approaching from behind. However, its acceleration decreases over the subsequent timesteps, mitigating the risk somewhat. By t=0.9s, it's still behind the ego vehicle, but its rapid deceleration suggests it's actively braking.

Obstacles 30647, 30650, 30653, 30655, and 30659 are in different lanelets and do not present immediate collision risks based on the provided trajectories. Obstacle 30665, appearing at t=0.5s, is also in a different lanelet and doesn't appear to pose a risk.

While obstacle 30667's behavior warrants attention, there is no indication of an imminent collision or contact in the given data. Therefore, a risk score of 2 (High Risk) is assigned to it, considering the initial speed difference and proximity within the same lane.
