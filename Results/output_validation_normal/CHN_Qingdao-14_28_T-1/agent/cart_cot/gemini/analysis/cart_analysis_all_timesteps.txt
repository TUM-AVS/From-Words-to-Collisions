At t=0.9s, the ego vehicle is at (-99.6661, -2457.8211) in lanelet 869.  Let's analyze the risk posed by each obstacle:

* **Obstacle 30647:** Located in lanelet 134 at (-76.4792, -2432.7717) (using 0.4s data as most recent), moving with a velocity of ~11 m/s. This obstacle is laterally separated and poses negligible risk. Risk Score: 5.

* **Obstacle 30650:** Stationary in lanelet 451 at (-88.6269, -2465.7139).  Laterally and longitudinally separated. Risk Score: 5.

* **Obstacle 30653:**  Almost stationary in lanelet 451 at (-82.2112, -2470.3113). Laterally separated, poses no immediate threat. Risk Score: 5.

* **Obstacle 30655:** Located in lanelet 130 at (-113.2222, -2475.7168), moving with a velocity of ~14 m/s. This obstacle is longitudinally separated and moving roughly parallel to the ego vehicle, presenting low risk. Risk Score: 4.

* **Obstacle 30659:** Stationary in lanelet 131 at (-104.4704, -2469.9633).  Laterally separated, no risk. Risk Score: 5

* **Obstacle 30665:** In lanelet 131 at (-110.0472, -2477.3263) with velocity ~1.6 m/s. It appears to be slowing down/stopping. It's longitudinally somewhat close but lateral separation suggests moderate risk. Risk Score: 3

* **Obstacle 30667:** Located in lanelet 133 at (-81.821, -2434.0628), moving with a velocity of ~14.5 m/s. Although this obstacle is in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle at 0.3s, and longitudinally close behind, the ego vehicle changes to lanelet 869 at 0.6s, suggesting the ego vehicle executes a lane change maneuver to avoid a potential collision. The rate of change of acceleration suggests strong braking of this obstacle but still poses medium risk due to closing velocity. Risk Score: 3
