### Analysis:

1. **Obstacle 30667 (Most Recent Timestep: 0.9s)**:
   - **Position**: (-81.821, -2434.0628)
   - **Velocity**: 14.4882 m/s (similar direction as ego)
   - **Lanelet**: 133.0 (same as ego at earlier timesteps, but ego has moved to lanelet 869.0)
   - **Relative Motion**: The obstacle is ahead of the ego but moving in the same direction. The lateral distance is significant, and the trajectories are diverging.
   - **Risk**: **Low (4)**

2. **Obstacle 30655 (Most Recent Timestep: 0.9s)**:
   - **Position**: (-113.2222, -2475.7168)
   - **Velocity**: 14.2041 m/s (opposite direction to ego)
   - **Lanelet**: 130.0 (adjacent to ego's lanelet 869.0)
   - **Relative Motion**: The obstacle is moving away from the ego, and the lateral distance is increasing.
   - **Risk**: **Negligible (5)**
