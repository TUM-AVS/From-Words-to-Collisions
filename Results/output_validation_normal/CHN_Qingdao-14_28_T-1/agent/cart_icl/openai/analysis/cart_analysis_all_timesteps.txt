In the given scenario, we will analyze the most recent timestep at 0.9 seconds to assess the potential collision risks of the ego vehicle with nearby obstacles.

### Analysis at 0.9 seconds:

1. **Ego Vehicle (30656.0):**
   - Position: (-99.6661, -2457.8211)
   - Orientation: -2.22 radians
   - Velocity: 17.8278 m/s
   - Acceleration: 0.7326 m/sÂ²

2. **Obstacle 30650.0:**
   - Position remains constant at (-88.6269, -2465.7139).
   - Velocity: 0.0 m/s (Stationary)
   - Since this obstacle is stationary and located far behind the ego vehicle and given that it is not influencing the ego vehicle's path, there is no immediate risk.

3. **Obstacle 30653.0:**
   - Position: (-82.2112, -2470.3113)
   - Velocity: 0.4079 m/s, slowing down further.
   - Given its slow speed and lateral position difference, it poses no immediate risk to the ego vehicle.

4. **Obstacle 30655.0:**
   - Position: (-113.2222, -2475.7168)
   - Velocity: 14.2041 m/s
   - With the position and velocity, it appears to be behind and gradually closing the distance. However, due to the lateral distance, it doesn't pose an immediate risk.

5. **Obstacle 30659.0:**
   - Stationary (Position: -104.4704, -2469.9633)
   - No risk due to its stationary nature and position in another lanelet.

6. **Obstacle 30665.0:**
   - Position: (-110.0472, -2477.3263)
   - Velocity: 1.5616 m/s
   - It is in another lanelet and with such slow relative velocity, there's no immediate collision risk.

7. **Obstacle 30667.0:**
   - Position: (-81.821, -2434.0628)
   - Velocity: 14.4882 m/s
   - The obstacle is closing in at relatively high speed but the positions suggest it is laterally distant from the ego vehicle. It is not in the same lanelet, thus posing a low risk.

**No Obstacle Poses Immediate High Risk:**

Given the above analysis, none of the obstacles are in a position or have a velocity that suggests an immediate threat of collision with the ego vehicle based on available data. The overall risks are minimal, indicating that with proper lane discipline and current conditions, the ego vehicle faces negligible risks from these obstacles in the current planned trajectory.
