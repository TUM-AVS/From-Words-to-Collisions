### Safety analysis for timestep 0.9s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

**Assumptions and Clarifications:**

* Since adjusted distances (adjusted_d_long, adjusted_d_lat) are not provided in the scenario, the provided real distance (DTClong, DTClat) will be used for the analysis.  This may lead to less precise risk assessments.  It is *highly recommended* to include adjusted distances for a more accurate analysis.
*  I will make estimations of TTC based on the relative velocity and distance.  Without explicit TTC calculations available, these estimations may have some error.
* I will assume that "Left" or "Front" means that the obstacle's lateral or longitudinal distance is approximately zero and that any small discrepancies are due to sensor noise. This allows for a simplified TTC estimation for these cases, assuming the dominant velocity component (lateral or longitudinal) is the primary factor for collision risk.
