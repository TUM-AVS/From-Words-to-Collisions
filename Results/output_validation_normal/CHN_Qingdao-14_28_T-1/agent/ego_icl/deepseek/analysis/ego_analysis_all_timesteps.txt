Let me analyze each obstacle at the most recent timestep (0.9 seconds) with trajectory context:

1. Obstacle 30650 (Left of ego):
   - Adjusted distances: longitudinal 0.00m, lateral 11.96m
   - Relative velocity: longitudinal -17.83 m/s (moving away), lateral 0.00 m/s
   - Motion: Exact longitudinal alignment, no lateral motion
   - Analysis: Side-by-side with safe lateral distance, moving away longitudinally
   - Risk: 5 (Negligible)

2. Obstacle 30653 (Left of ego):
   - Adjusted distances: longitudinal 0.00m, lateral 19.85m
   - Relative velocity: longitudinal -17.82 m/s (moving away), lateral -0.41 m/s (slowly approaching)
   - Motion: Exact longitudinal alignment, very slow lateral approach
   - Analysis: Large lateral distance with minimal closing velocity
   - Risk: 5 (Negligible)

3. Obstacle 30655 (Front of ego):
   - Adjusted distances: longitudinal 17.94m, lateral 0.00m
   - Relative velocity: longitudinal -3.62 m/s (approaching), lateral 0.01 m/s
   - Motion: Same-lane alignment, slow approach
   - TTC: 17.94/3.62 = 4.96s
   - MDC: 17.94m (longitudinal)
   - Risk: 4 (Low Risk - approaching but sufficient time)

4. Obstacle 30659 (Front-left of ego):
   - Adjusted distances: longitudinal 8.07m, lateral 1.90m
   - Relative velocity: longitudinal -17.83 m/s (fast approach), lateral 0.00 m/s
   - Motion: Rapid longitudinal approach
   - TTC: 8.07/17.83 = 0.45s
   - MDC: 1.90m (lateral)
   - Analysis: Extremely fast approach but lateral distance provides buffer
   - Risk: 1 (Extreme Risk due to very low TTC)

5. Obstacle 30665 (Front-left of ego):
   - Adjusted distances: longitudinal 17.31m, lateral 1.90m
   - Relative velocity: longitudinal -19.39 m/s (fast approach), lateral 0.00 m/s
   - Motion: Rapid longitudinal approach
   - TTC: 17.31/19.39 = 0.89s
   - MDC: 1.90m (lateral)
   - Risk: 2 (High Risk due to fast approach)

6. Obstacle 30667 (Behind of ego):
   - Adjusted distances: longitudinal -25.21m, lateral 0.00m
   - Relative velocity: longitudinal -3.34 m/s (moving away), lateral 0.08 m/s
   - Motion: Moving away in same lane
   - Risk: 5 (Negligible)
