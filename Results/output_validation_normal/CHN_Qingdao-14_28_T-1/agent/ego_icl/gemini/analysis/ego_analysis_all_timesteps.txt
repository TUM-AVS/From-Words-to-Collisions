At t=0.9s:

* **Obstacle 30650:** Left of ego, longitudinal 0.00m, lateral 11.96m.  Laterally far, longitudinally aligned. No immediate risk, but monitor. Relative longitudinal velocity is -17.83 m/s suggests ego is moving faster in same direction. Risk level 5 due to distance and separation.
* **Obstacle 30653:** Left of ego, longitudinal 0.00m, lateral 19.85m.  Laterally far, longitudinally aligned. No immediate risk. Risk level 5 due to large lateral distance.
* **Obstacle 30655:** Front of ego, longitudinal 17.94m, lateral 0.00m.  Longitudinally far, laterally aligned in the same lane. TTC = 17.94m / 3.62m/s ≈ 4.95s.  Low risk but monitor. Risk level 4.
* **Obstacle 30659:** Front-left of ego, longitudinal 8.07m, lateral 1.90m. Since the obstacle is primarily in front and approaching, the longitudinal distance is more critical. TTC = 8.07m / 17.83m/s ≈ 0.45s. Extreme risk due to very short TTC, despite some lateral offset. Risk level 1.
* **Obstacle 30665:** Front-left of ego, longitudinal 17.31m, lateral 1.90m. Primarily in front. TTC = 17.31 / 19.39 ≈ 0.89s. Risk level 2 (High).
* **Obstacle 30667:** Behind ego, longitudinal -25.21m, lateral 0.00m. Moving away longitudinally (-3.34 m/s), and laterally aligned. No risk. Risk level 5.
