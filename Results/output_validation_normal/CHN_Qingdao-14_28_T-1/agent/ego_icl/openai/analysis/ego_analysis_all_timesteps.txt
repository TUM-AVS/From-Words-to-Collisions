### Obstacle Analysis

#### Obstacle 30650 (Left of Ego)
- **Relative Velocities**: Longitudinal: -17.83 m/s, Lateral: 0.00 m/s
- **Motion**: Exact longitudinal alignment, no lateral movement
- **Risk Assessment**:
  - **Longitudinal Distance**: 0.00 m
  - **Lateral Distance**: 11.96 m
  - **TTC (Longitudinal)**: 0.00 m / 17.83 m/s > 5.0 seconds (No immediate risk longitudinally due to alignment)
  - **MDC**: As the obstacle is aligned longitudinally but with a sufficient lateral gap, collision is unlikely.
  - **Conclusion**: Risk mainly driven by lateral distance; no imminent collision risk.

#### Obstacle 30653 (Left of Ego)
- **Relative Velocities**: Longitudinal: -17.82 m/s, Lateral: -0.41 m/s
- **Motion**: Exact longitudinal alignment, moving laterally towards the ego vehicle
- **Risk Assessment**:
  - **Longitudinal Distance**: 0.00 m
  - **Lateral Distance**: 19.85 m
  - **TTC and MDC**: Risk of lateral approach is mitigated by the vast separation in lateral space.
  - **Conclusion**: Lateral distance is adequate, no risk of collision.

#### Obstacle 30655 (Front of Ego)
- **Relative Velocities**: Longitudinal: -3.62 m/s, Lateral: 0.01 m/s
- **Motion**: Driving towards the ego
- **Risk Assessment**:
  - **Longitudinal Distance**: 17.94 m
  - **TTC (Longitudinal)**: TTC = 17.94 m / 3.62 m/s ≈ 4.95 seconds
  - **MDC**: Longitudinal trajectory indicates a managed approach due to substantial distance.
  - **Conclusion**: Low risk due to enough time and space to react.

#### Obstacle 30659 (Front-left of Ego)
- **Relative Velocities**: Longitudinal: -17.83 m/s, Lateral: 0.00 m/s
- **Motion**: Approaching longitudinally
- **Risk Assessment**:
  - **Longitudinal Distance**: 8.07 m
  - **Lateral Distance**: 1.90 m
  - **TTC (Longitudinal)**: TTC = 8.07 m / 17.83 m/s ≈ 0.45 seconds
  - **MDC**: Sufficient separation in both directions.
  - **Conclusion**: Extreme risk based on the tightening longitudinal gap.

#### Obstacle 30665 (Front-left of Ego)
- **Relative Velocities**: Longitudinal: -19.39 m/s, Lateral: 0.00 m/s
- **Motion**: Approaching from the left
- **Risk Assessment**:
  - **Longitudinal Distance**: 17.31 m
  - **Lateral Distance**: 1.90 m
  - **TTC (Longitudinal)**: TTC = 17.31 m / 19.39 m/s ≈ 0.89 seconds
  - **MDC**: Adequate lateral space currently, but closing longitudinal gap.
  - **Conclusion**: High risk based on time to collision.

#### Obstacle 30667 (Behind of Ego)
- **Relative Velocities**: Longitudinal: -3.34 m/s, Lateral: 0.08 m/s
- **Motion**: Moving away
- **Risk Assessment**:
  - **Longitudinal Distance**: -25.21 m
  - **TTC**: Obstacle moving away as indicated by negative distance and closing behind.
  - **MDC**: Not applicable as motion is away.
  - **Conclusion**: No risk as obstacle is not approaching.
