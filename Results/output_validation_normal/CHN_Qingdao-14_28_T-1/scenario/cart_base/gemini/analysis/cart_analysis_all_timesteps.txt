At t=0.9s, Ego is in lanelet 869.  Let's analyze the closest obstacles:

* **Obstacle 30667**: This obstacle is in lanelet 133 and was previously approaching Ego rapidly while both were in lanelet 133. Although Ego has changed to lanelet 869, the rapid deceleration of Obstacle 30667 (-4.9189 m/sÂ²) and its continued proximity suggests a possible lane change maneuver by this obstacle, which could still pose a high risk. This requires further investigation to assess if the lane change trajectory intersects with Ego's.

* **Obstacle 30655**: In lanelet 130, shows a decreasing velocity and poses no immediate threat.

* **Obstacle 30653**: Stationary and far from Ego, poses no immediate threat.

* **Obstacle 30650**: Stationary and far from Ego, poses no immediate threat.

* **Obstacle 30659**: Stationary and far from Ego, poses no immediate threat.

* **Obstacle 30665**:  In lanelet 131, slowing down and presents no immediate risk.


Since Ego has changed lanelets and Obstacle 30667 is also decelerating rapidly, there isn't enough information to definitively categorize Obstacle 30667 as an *extreme* risk (requiring immediate evasive action from Ego). More data points would be needed to confidently ascertain Obstacle 30667's trajectory following its deceleration and determine the true level of risk.  However, given its proximity and recent rapid approach, it represents at least a *medium* risk.


```json
{
  "CollisionObstacles": [],
  "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null,
  "ScenarioAnalysis": {
    "IsCollisionScenario": false,
    "Reasoning": "No obstacle presents an immediate collision risk at t=0.9s. Obstacle 30667 requires further observation due to its recent rapid approach and deceleration, suggesting a possible lane change that might intersect with Ego's path. It is currently assessed as a medium risk, not extreme."
