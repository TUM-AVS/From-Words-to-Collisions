### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 30650.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is located in a different lanelet (451) than the ego vehicle (869) and exhibits no movement over the observed time period.  The lateral distance is substantial.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Stationary obstacle poses no immediate time-related risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5
- Obstacle ID: 30653.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is located in a different lanelet (451) from the ego vehicle (869), maintaining a safe lateral distance. Its slow velocity and consistent deceleration further reduce risk.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Although moving, the obstacle's slow speed and deceleration suggest minimal time-related risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5
- Obstacle ID: 30655.0
- Distance Risk reason: Located in a different lanelet (130) and is moving away from the ego vehicle in the x-direction. Lateral distance is also significant.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason:  The diverging trajectories and the significant lateral distance minimize time-related risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5
- Obstacle ID: 30659.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is stationary and in a different lanelet (131) than the ego vehicle (869), with considerable lateral distance.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: No time-based risk due to its stationary nature.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5
- Obstacle ID: 30665.0
- Distance Risk reason: Though in a different lanelet (131) initially, this obstacle's trajectory warrants attention as it appears to be moving slowly and its future trajectory is uncertain.  Lateral distance provides some buffer.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason:  Slow movement and deceleration suggest reduced risk, but continuous monitoring is necessary.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4
- Obstacle ID: 30667.0
- Distance Risk reason: While in the same lanelet (133) as the ego vehicle initially, the obstacle is behind and moving away from the ego vehicle. This makes the longitudinal distance larger.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason:  Receding motion indicates no immediate time-related risk, even though they are in the same lanelet.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5


### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. **Most critical obstacles:** Initially, obstacle 30667.0 appeared potentially critical as it was in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle. Obstacle 30665.0 also needed attention due to its uncertain trajectory.
2. **Trajectory analysis:** Over the 10 timesteps, obstacle 30667.0 consistently moved further behind the ego vehicle, clearly indicating a diverging trajectory. Obstacle 30665.0 moved slowly. Other obstacles remained stationary or maintained a safe distance in different lanelets.
3. **Relative positions, velocities, and accelerations:** The relative velocities and accelerations between the ego vehicle and all obstacles, particularly 30667.0, show divergence, not convergence. This suggests no collision risk.
4. **Collision determination:** No collision has occurred, and the data strongly suggests no imminent collision risk.
5. **Reasoning:** The analysis of trajectories, relative motion, and lanelet information indicates that the ego vehicle and obstacles are moving in a way that mitigates collision risk.

{
  "CollisionObstacles": [],
  "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null,
  "ScenarioAnalysis": {
    "IsCollisionScenario": false,
    "Reasoning": "No collisions are detected or predicted. All obstacles are either moving away from the ego vehicle, are stationary at a safe distance, or are in different lanelets.  Although obstacle 30665.0 warrants monitoring, its current trajectory and speed do not pose an immediate collision risk."
