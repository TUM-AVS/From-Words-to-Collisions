Obstacles 30650 and 30653 pose an extreme risk of collision.

* **Obstacle 30650:**  At 0.9 seconds, this obstacle is directly to the left of the ego vehicle (lateral distance 11.96m, longitudinal 0m) and moving at a relative longitudinal velocity of -17.83 m/s.  This indicates a likely immediate side collision if the ego vehicle were to move left even slightly.

* **Obstacle 30653:**  Similarly, obstacle 30653 is also to the ego's immediate left (lateral distance 19.85, longitudinal 0m) at 0.9 seconds with a substantial negative relative longitudinal velocity of -17.82 m/s. It represents an extreme side collision risk should the ego vehicle move towards it.

Obstacle 30659 is nearing a high-risk state but not extreme yet. It's located at longitudinal 8.07 m and lateral 1.90 m relative to the ego and is closing in at -17.83 m/s longitudinally. While not an *immediate* collision risk in the very next timestep, a collision is extremely likely in the next few timesteps if the ego continues its trajectory.

  },
  "ScenarioAnalysis": {
    "IsCollisionScenario": false,
    "Reasoning": "Obstacles 30650 and 30653 present extreme side collision risks at t=0.9s due to their immediate left proximity and high negative longitudinal relative velocities. Although no collision occurs in this timestep, a collision is highly likely in the immediate future unless evasive action is taken. Obstacle 30650 is flagged as the primary ExtremeRiskObstacle because it is closer."
