At t=0.9s, Obstacle 30659 is closest to the ego vehicle with a longitudinal distance of 8.07m and lateral distance of 1.9m, approaching at -17.83 m/s longitudinally.  While this is a close proximity, it's not an immediate collision given the 1.9m lateral distance. No other obstacles present an immediate collision risk at this timestep.

**Risk Levels and Definitions:**
<Collision (Score: 0)>: Actual collision has occurred or is unavoidable within the next timestep.
<Extreme Risk (Score: 1)>: Immediate collision or very high likelihood of impact. Urgent action is required.
<High Risk (Score: 2)>: Close to collision or highly probable collision path. Needs prompt attention and quick manoeuvring.
<Medium Risk (Score: 3)>: Moderate collision risk but manageable with timely reactions and proper strategies.
<Low Risk (Score: 4)>: Minimal collision risk. The situation is controllable with sufficient time to react.
<Negligible Risk (Score: 5)>: No significant collision risk. Obstacles are either moving away or far enough not to interfere.
