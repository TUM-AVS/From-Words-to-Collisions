### Safety analysis for timestep 0.9 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

**Assumptions and Clarifications:**

* The prompt mentions "adjusted distances" (adjusted_d_long and adjusted_d_lat), but these values are not provided in the scenario context.  Therefore, the analysis will be based on the provided "real distance" (DTClong and DTClat) values. This may lead to less precise risk assessment.
* TTC calculations will be simplified due to the lack of consistent acceleration data.  A constant velocity model will be assumed for a rough TTC estimate.
* A collision is assumed when distance in both longitudinal and lateral directions approaches zero.
* The size and shape of the ego vehicle and obstacles are not provided, affecting the accuracy of collision estimations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID:** 30650
- **Distance Risk reason:**  Located at approximately 0.0m longitudinally and laterally from the ego vehicle, indicating an extremely high risk of collision.
- **Distance safety score:** 0
- **Time Risk reason:** Given the very small distance and the closing relative velocity, TTC is virtually zero.
- **Time safety score:** 0
- **Overall Risk score:** 0

- **Obstacle ID:** 30653
- **Distance Risk reason:** Located at approximately 0.0m longitudinally and laterally from the ego vehicle, indicating an extremely high risk of collision.
- **Distance safety score:** 0
- **Time Risk reason:**  Given the very small distance and the closing relative velocity, TTC is virtually zero.
- **Time safety score:** 0
- **Overall Risk score:** 0

- **Obstacle ID:** 30655
- **Distance Risk reason:** Relatively far from the ego vehicle (17.94m longitudinally and laterally).
- **Distance safety score:** 5
- **Time Risk reason:** While the obstacle is approaching longitudinally, the closing speed is slow, providing ample time to react.
- **Time safety score:** 4
- **Overall Risk score:** 4

- **Obstacle ID:** 30659
- **Distance Risk reason:** At 8.07m longitudinally and laterally, posing a medium risk.
- **Distance safety score:** 3
- **Time Risk reason:**  The closing velocity is quite high, increasing the risk.
- **Time safety score:** 2
- **Overall Risk score:** 2

- **Obstacle ID:** 30665
- **Distance Risk reason:**  Far from the ego vehicle (17.31m longitudinally and laterally).
- **Distance safety score:** 5
- **Time Risk reason:**  Although the obstacle is approaching, the distance is significant enough to allow for reaction.
- **Time safety score:** 4
- **Overall Risk score:** 4


- **Obstacle ID:** 30667
- **Distance Risk reason:** Located behind the ego vehicle at -25.21m longitudinally and laterally, presenting no risk.
- **Distance safety score:** 5
- **Time Risk reason:** The obstacle is moving away longitudinally, further reducing risk.
- **Time safety score:** 5
- **Overall Risk score:** 5
