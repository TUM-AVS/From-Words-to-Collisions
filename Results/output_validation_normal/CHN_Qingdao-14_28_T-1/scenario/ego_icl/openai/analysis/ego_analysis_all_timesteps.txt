To properly evaluate the risk of collision, I will conduct a detailed analysis of the situation concerning the latest (most recent) timestep at 0.9 seconds.

### Obstacle Analysis at 0.9 seconds (Adjusted Distances and Scenario):

1. **Obstacle 30650:**
   - **Position**: Left of the ego vehicle.
   - **Adjusted longitudinal distance**: 0.00 m.
   - **Adjusted lateral distance**: 11.96 m.
   - **Relative velocity**: longitudinal -17.83 m/s (moving towards ego), lateral 0.00 m/s.
   - **Trajectory**: Exact longitudinal alignment or co-linearity with no lateral relative motion.

   **Risk Assessment**:
   - **TTC Calculation (Longitudinal)**: Since in perfect longitudinal alignment, the distance = 0.00 m and the relative velocity is -17.83 m/s, indicating an ongoing alignment.
   - **MDC Calculation**: 0.00 m in the longitudinal dimension due to exact alignment.
   - **Motion Confirm**: Obstacle has reached the same longitudinal alignment point.

   Given the exact alignment in the longitudinal direction (distance 0.0 m), this indicates a **collision condition (Risk score 0)**. 

2. **Obstacle 30653:**
   - **Position**: Left of the ego vehicle.
   - **Adjusted longitudinal distance**: 0.00 m.
   - **Adjusted lateral distance**: 19.85 m.
   - **Relative velocity**: longitudinal -17.82 m/s, lateral -0.41 m/s (moving closer).
   - **Trajectory**: Exact longitudinal alignment or co-linearity and moving laterally towards the ego.

   **Risk Assessment**:
   - **TTC Calculation (Longitudinal)**: Given the longitudinal distance is 0.00 m at exact alignment, colliding or just perfectly aligned.
   - **MDC Calculation**: Longitudinal MDC is 0.00 m with closing lateral motion.
   - **Motion Confirm**: Lateral movement towards ego.

   As with Obstacle 30650, this scenario shows perfect longitudinal alignment, resulting in a **collision condition (Risk score 0)**.

3. **Obstacle 30655:**
   - **Position**: In front of the ego vehicle.
   - **Adjusted longitudinal distance**: 17.94 m.
   - **Adjusted lateral distance**: 0.00 m.
   - **Relative velocity**: longitudinal -3.62 m/s (approaching), lateral 0.01 m/s.
   - **Trajectory**: Exact lateral alignment or unknown case. Approaching slowly longitudinally.

   **Risk Assessment**:
   - **TTC Calculation (Longitudinal)**: 17.94 m / 3.62 m/s ≈ 4.95 seconds.
   - **MDC Calculation**: Longitudinal distance = 17.94 m.
   - **Motion Confirm**: Slow approach with exact lateral alignment.

   With a TTC close to 5 seconds and not presently in alignment, the risk is low, registering at **Risk score 4**.

4. **Obstacle 30659:**
   - **Position**: Front-left of ego vehicle.
   - **Adjusted longitudinal distance**: 8.07 m.
   - **Adjusted lateral distance**: 1.90 m.
   - **Relative velocity**: longitudinal -17.83 m/s, lateral 0.00 m/s.

   **Risk Assessment**:
   - **TTC Calculation (Longitudinal)**: 8.07 m / 17.83 m/s ≈ 0.45 seconds.
   - **MDC Calculation**: Calculating considering the approach, approximate MDC will be below 1.0 m soon.

   With a potentially dangerous TTC, this registers a **High risk (Risk score 2)**.

5. **Obstacle 30665:**
   - **Position**: Front-left of ego vehicle.
   - **Adjusted longitudinal distance**: 17.31 m.
   - **Adjusted lateral distance**: 1.90 m.
   - **Relative velocity**: longitudinal -19.39 m/s, lateral 0.00 m/s.

   **Risk Assessment**:
   - **TTC Calculation (Longitudinal)**: 17.31 m / 19.39 m/s ≈ 0.89 seconds.
   - **MDC Calculation**: Longitudinal based on trajectory would reduce to under 1.0 m in  a second, considering closing pattern across dimensions.

   Therefore, it poses a **High risk (Risk score 2)** based on approaching speed.

6. **Obstacle 30667:**
   - **Position**: Behind the ego vehicle.
   - **Adjusted longitudinal distance**: -25.21 m.
   - **Adjusted lateral distance**: 0.00 m.
   - **Relative velocity**: longitudinal -3.34 m/s, lateral 0.08 m/s.

   **Risk Assessment**:
   - **TTC Calculation (Longitudinal)**: Approaching, but due to moving away, not immediately relevant in a forward motion.
   - **MDC Calculation**: Positioned completely behind, outside immediate risk.

   Here, no immediate collision risk occurs, **No risk (Risk score 5)**.

### Conclusion

Given the analysis:
- **Obstacles 30650 and 30653** are in a collision-aligned position at the most recent timestep.
- This scenario inherently registers as a collision situation under the defined conditions due to their exact longitudinal alignment with the ego vehicle.

### JSON Summary
```json
{
  "CollisionObstacle": {
    "ObstacleID": "30650",
    "OverallRiskScore": "0"
  },
  "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {
    "ObstacleID": "30653",
    "OverallRiskScore": "0"
  },
  "IsCollisionScenario": true,
  "Justification": "Both obstacles 30650 and 30653 present exact longitudinal alignment with the ego vehicle, indicating collision conditions with a risk score of 0."
}
``` 

The analysis indicates an immediate collision scenario due to the longitudinal alignment with zero distance between the obstacles and the ego vehicle.
