The ego vehicle and obstacle 30656.0 are in the same lanelet (133.0).  While the obstacle starts further ahead, both vehicles' x-coordinates are decreasing, indicating they're likely traveling in the same general direction. The obstacle's x-position decreases less rapidly than the ego vehicle's, meaning the ego vehicle is approaching the obstacle from behind. The y-coordinates also suggest a converging trajectory, with both vehicles moving roughly parallel but the ego vehicle slightly closer to the obstacle at each timestep.  

Although the data shows the ego vehicle approaching the obstacle, at 0.9 seconds, the distance between them remains significant. There's no indication of an imminent collision. The closing rate is moderate, and there's time for the ego vehicle to react (e.g., by braking or changing lanes).  Therefore, while the obstacle presents some risk, it doesn't warrant a risk score of 0 (collision), 1 (extreme risk), or even 2 (high risk). It's more likely a medium risk (3) at this point, possibly trending towards high risk if the current trajectories continue without correction.
