The ego vehicle and obstacle 30656.0 are in the same lanelet (133.0).  The x-positions of both are decreasing, meaning they are likely travelling in the same general direction. However, the x-position of the obstacle is consistently ahead of the ego vehicle, and while the gap is closing, it's not closing at a rate that suggests an immediate or unavoidable collision within the timeframe of the provided data.  Additionally, the difference in y-position is also fairly consistent and doesn't indicate a lateral movement that would lead to a collision. It seems the ego vehicle is decelerating more aggressively than the obstacle vehicle.

Based on this analysis, within the 0.9 seconds observed, no collision occurs and the risk of collision seems relatively low.  Further data points are needed to assess longer-term risk, especially considering the deceleration behavior of the ego vehicle.
