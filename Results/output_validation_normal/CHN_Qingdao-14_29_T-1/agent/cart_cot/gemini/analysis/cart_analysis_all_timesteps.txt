Here's the collision risk analysis for the provided scenario:

**Analysis at t=0.9s:**

* **Ego Vehicle (ID 30655.0):**
    * Position: (3.1148, -2345.3422)
    * Velocity: 35.2939 (Units assumed to be m/s)
    * Acceleration: 0.1099 (Units assumed to be m/s^2)
* **Obstacle Vehicle (ID 30656.0):**
    * Position: (16.3137, -2337.4546)
    * Velocity: 31.7927 (Units assumed to be m/s)
    * Acceleration: -3.1926 (Units assumed to be m/s^2)

**Calculations and Reasoning:**

1. **Distance:** The distance between the Ego and the Obstacle at t=0.9s is approximately 13.27 meters using the distance formula with the given coordinates.

2. **Relative Velocity:** The obstacle is moving slower than the ego vehicle, and its negative acceleration suggests it's braking.  A more precise relative velocity calculation would require separating the X and Y velocity components, but we can estimate that the vehicles are moving towards each other primarily along the x-axis and the ego vehicle is approaching from behind.

3. **Time to Collision (TTC):**  Without precise velocity components, a direct TTC is difficult. However, we can estimate.  The x-coordinate difference is about 13.2 meters. If we assume a relative longitudinal velocity of 35.2939 - 31.7927 = 3.5 m/s for now (rough approximation), the estimated TTC would be 13.2 / 3.5 which is approximately 3.8 seconds (if they were on a direct collision course along X-axis, this assumes they keep the same direction.) The y-coordinate difference suggests they are not on a direct collision course.


4. **Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC):**  Since the obstacle is approximately 8 meters ahead in y-coordinate and 13 meters away in x-coordinate and they are moving roughly in the same direction, the distance of 13.27 meters is a good estimate for MDC at this moment in time. This value could decrease in the following timesteps, so the exact minimal distance would require more detailed analysis and calculation for the future time steps.


5. **Risk Assessment:** Based on current positions and velocity, a direct collision is not imminent in the immediate next time step. However, the cars share the same lane, and there is some uncertainty in the relative speed. Although the cars are predicted to eventually collide, the ego vehicle is slightly decelerating, and the obstacle is more aggressively decelerating.  Both of these factors would need to be calculated over multiple timesteps to properly determine the final risk. Because there are no direct collision in next timestep (t = 1.0s) so I will give a RiskScore 3 as a Medium Risk.
