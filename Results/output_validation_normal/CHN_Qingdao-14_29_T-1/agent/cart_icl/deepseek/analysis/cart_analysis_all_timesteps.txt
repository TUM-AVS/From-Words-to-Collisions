### Analysis:

1. **Most Recent Timestep (0.9s):**
   - **Ego Vehicle (30655.0):**
     - Position: (3.1148, -2345.3422)
     - Velocity: 35.2939 m/s
     - Acceleration: 0.1099 m/s²
   - **Obstacle (30656.0):**
     - Position: (16.3137, -2337.4546)
     - Velocity: 31.7927 m/s
     - Acceleration: -3.1926 m/s²

2. **Relative Motion:**
   - The ego vehicle is ahead of the obstacle in the longitudinal direction (X-axis).
   - The obstacle is decelerating (negative acceleration), while the ego vehicle is slightly accelerating.
   - The lateral distance (Y-axis) is minimal, indicating both vehicles are in the same lane (lanelet 133.0).

3. **Time to Collision (TTC):**
   - Relative longitudinal distance: 3.1148 - 16.3137 = -13.1989 m (obstacle is behind ego)
   - Relative longitudinal velocity: 35.2939 - 31.7927 = 3.5012 m/s (ego is moving faster)
   - TTC = -13.1989 / 3.5012 ≈ -3.77 s (negative TTC indicates no immediate collision risk as the obstacle is behind and ego is moving faster).

4. **Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC):**
   - The lateral distance is negligible (both in the same lane), but the longitudinal distance is increasing due to the ego vehicle's higher speed.

5. **Risk Assessment:**
   - The obstacle is behind the ego vehicle and decelerating, while the ego vehicle is slightly accelerating. The distance between them is increasing, indicating no immediate risk of collision.
   - The overall risk is **Low (4)** as there is sufficient time and distance to react if the obstacle's behavior changes.
