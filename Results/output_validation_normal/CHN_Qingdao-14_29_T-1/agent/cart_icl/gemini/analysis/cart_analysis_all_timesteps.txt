At t=0.9s, the ego vehicle (ID 30655) is at (3.1148, -2345.3422) with a velocity of 35.29 m/s and the obstacle (ID 30656) is at (16.3137, -2337.4546) with a velocity of 31.79 m/s.  Both are in the same lanelet (133).

The obstacle is ahead of the ego vehicle in the x-direction by approximately 13.2 meters, but significantly closer in the y-direction (a difference of about 7.89 meters).  Given the orientations are similar and velocities are in the same general direction, the primary concern is the closing of the y-distance. The obstacle's deceleration at this timestep (-3.19 m/sÂ²) suggests it might be braking or reacting to the ego vehicle, slightly mitigating the risk.

Calculating a precise TTC in this scenario is complex due to the two-dimensional motion and non-constant velocities. However, a simplified analysis of the y-components of the vehicles' motion suggests a potential risk. The relative velocity in the y-direction is decreasing due to the ego vehicle's trajectory and the obstacle's braking. A rough estimate, based on the current positions and velocities, places the vehicles in relatively close proximity within the next second, especially given the lateral (y-direction) component.

While a collision is not imminent at t=0.9s, the rapid change in the obstacle's acceleration raises concern.  Further analysis considering the turning behavior (represented by the change in orientation) is needed to refine the risk assessment.  A high-risk score is warranted due to the proximity, closing distance, and the relatively small difference in x-coordinates despite the obstacle's deceleration.
