### Analysis

In the scenario provided, we will analyze the motion trajectories of both the ego vehicle (Ego: 30655.0) and the obstacle (Obstacle: 30656.0) for collision risk, primarily focusing on the last timestep at 0.9 seconds.

1. **Ego Vehicle Trajectory:**
   - At 0.9 seconds, its position is (3.1148, -2345.3422) with velocity 35.2939 m/s and acceleration 0.1099 m/s².

2. **Obstacle Trajectory:**
   - At 0.9 seconds, its position is (16.3137, -2337.4546) with velocity 31.7927 m/s and acceleration -3.1926 m/s².

3. **Relative Position and Motion:**
   - From the positions at 0.9 seconds, the longitudinal position difference is approximately 16.3137 - 3.1148 = 13.1989 meters (the obstacle is ahead).
   - The lateral position difference is -2337.4546 - (-2345.3422) = 7.8876 meters.
   - The relative velocity is approximately 31.7927 - 35.2939 = -3.5012 m/s (the obstacle is slowing down relative to ego).

4. **Time to Collision (TTC) Calculation:**
   - Given the relative longitudinal velocity is negative, collision is not imminent in terms of approaching each other longitudinally.

5. **Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC):**
   - The lateral distance is considerable at 7.8876 meters, which reduces the immediate risk of collision.

### Risk Assessment

- Considering the relative motion and distance, the risk of immediate collision appears low. The longitudinal separation is significant compared to the rate of closure.
- The lateral distance is ample to further negate collision risk.
  
Based on the above points, we evaluate the obstacle's risk level as follows:

- **Ego and Obstacle Trajectories:** Although they are in the same lanelet, current trajectories suggest no immediate collision risk due to sufficient separation longitudinally and laterally.
- **Overall Risk Score for Obstacle 30656.0:** **4 (Low Risk)**

Since there is no risk score of 0 or 1, the situation doesn't warrant detailed explanations for those extreme risk scenarios.
