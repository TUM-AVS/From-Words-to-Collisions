The obstacle is moving away from the ego vehicle, increasing in longitudinal distance over each time step.  At the last timestep (0.9 seconds), the obstacle is 10.86 meters behind the ego vehicle and moving away at a relative longitudinal velocity of -3.51 m/s.  While the lateral distance is 0, indicating it's directly behind the ego vehicle, the motion suggests it's not a collision risk.  The relative longitudinal acceleration has become positive (2.81 m/sÂ²), indicating the obstacle is decelerating or the ego vehicle is accelerating. Given the current data, the risk level is negligible.
