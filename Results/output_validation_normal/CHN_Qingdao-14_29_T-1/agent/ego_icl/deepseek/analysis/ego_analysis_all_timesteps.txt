### Obstacle-by-Obstacle Analysis

#### Obstacle 30656 (Behind ego car)
- **Most Recent Timestep (0.9s)**:
  - **Adjusted Longitudinal Distance**: -10.86 m (behind ego)
  - **Adjusted Lateral Distance**: 0.00 m (exact lateral alignment)
  - **Relative Velocity**: 
    - Longitudinal: -3.51 m/s (moving away from ego)
    - Lateral: -0.60 m/s (moving slightly away laterally)
  - **Relative Acceleration**: 
    - Longitudinal: 2.81 m/s² (decelerating away)
    - Lateral: 1.73 m/s² (decelerating away laterally)
  - **Motion Description**: "Obstacle is moving away longitudinally. Exact lateral alignment or unknown case."

- **Trajectory Analysis**:
  - Over the timesteps, the longitudinal distance increases (from -7.51 m to -10.86 m), indicating the obstacle is moving away from the ego vehicle.
  - The lateral distance remains 0.00 m, but the lateral velocity is negative (-0.60 m/s), meaning the obstacle is moving slightly away laterally as well.
  - The relative velocities and accelerations confirm the obstacle is not closing in on the ego vehicle in either dimension.

- **Time-to-Collision (TTC)**:
  - Longitudinal TTC: Not applicable (relative velocity is negative, meaning the obstacle is moving away).
  - Lateral TTC: Not applicable (relative velocity is negative, meaning the obstacle is moving away).
  - **Conclusion**: No TTC-based risk (Risk 5).

- **Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC)**:
  - Longitudinal MDC: 10.86 m (Risk 5).
  - Lateral MDC: 0.00 m (but obstacle is moving away, so no risk).
  - **Conclusion**: No MDC-based risk (Risk 5).

- **Overall Risk Assessment**:
  - The obstacle is moving away in both longitudinal and lateral dimensions, with no closing velocities. The exact lateral alignment does not pose a risk because the obstacle is not approaching the ego vehicle.
  - **Overall Risk Score**: 5 (Negligible Risk).

### Final Notes
- No collision or extreme/high-risk obstacles detected. The only obstacle (30656) is moving away from the ego vehicle in both dimensions, posing negligible risk.
- The JSON summary reflects the absence of significant risks.
