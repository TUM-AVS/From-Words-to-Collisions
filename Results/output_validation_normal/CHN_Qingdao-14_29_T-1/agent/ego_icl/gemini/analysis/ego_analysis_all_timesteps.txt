Obstacle 30656 is behind the ego vehicle and moving away.  Across all timesteps, the longitudinal distance increases, indicating divergence. The lateral distance remains at 0.00m, suggesting the obstacle is directly behind the ego vehicle. Since the relative longitudinal velocity is negative and increasing (becoming more negative), the obstacle is moving away from the ego vehicle faster over time.

At the last timestep (0.9s), the longitudinal distance is -10.86m and the lateral distance is 0.00m. Since the obstacle is moving away, TTC is not relevant in this case as a collision is not possible.  The MDC is also not a concern as the obstacle is moving away. Based on this, the risk level is negligible.
