### Obstacle Analysis

#### Obstacle 30656
- **Current Position (Most Recent Time Step, t = 0.9s):**
  - Adjusted Longitudinal Distance: -10.86 m (indicating the obstacle is behind the ego vehicle)
  - Adjusted Lateral Distance: 0.00 m (indicating a potential same-lane alignment)
  - Relative Velocity: Longitudinal -3.51 m/s, Lateral -0.60 m/s (indicating the obstacle is moving away both longitudinally and laterally)
  - Relative Acceleration: Longitudinal 2.81 m/s², Lateral 1.73 m/s²

- **Trajectory and Motion Description:**
  - The obstacle is consistently moving away from the ego vehicle over the recorded time steps, confirming a diverging path.
  - Exact lateral alignment is noted, but with increasing longitudinal distance.
  - Relative acceleration values are positive, reinforcing the motion away from the ego vehicle.

- **Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC):**
  - Given the diverging path and increasing longitudinal distance, the MDC is essentially the increasing (negative) longitudinal distance staying negative, indicating no risk of collision due to diverging trajectories.

- **Time-to-Collision (TTC):**
  - Since the relative velocity indicates the obstacle is moving away and the longitudinal distance is negative, TTC is not applicable as there is no risk of collision.

- **Risk Assessment:**
  - The obstacle exhibits no imminent threat as it is moving away with increasing distance.
  - Longitudinal distance remains consistently negative across observation periods, confirming no risk with diverging paths.
  - Therefore, the assessed risk level for this obstacle is "5: Negligible Risk."
