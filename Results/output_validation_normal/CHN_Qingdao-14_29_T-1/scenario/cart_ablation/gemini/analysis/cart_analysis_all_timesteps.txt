At t=0.9s, the ego vehicle is at (3.1148, -2345.3422) and the obstacle is at (16.3137, -2337.4546).  While the Y coordinates are converging, the X coordinates are still separated by over 13 units.  Given the current velocities and accelerations, a collision in the next immediate timestep (0.1s) is not certain.  However, the continuous convergence in Y and the relatively small difference in X suggests a high risk of collision soon. Although there isn't enough information to definitively determine an *extreme* risk at *this precise moment*, the trend clearly warrants attention. Additional information, such as lanelet width, vehicle dimensions, and more precise future trajectory predictions, are needed for a more accurate assessment. Therefore, we classify this as a high-risk (2 or 3) but not *extreme* risk (1).
