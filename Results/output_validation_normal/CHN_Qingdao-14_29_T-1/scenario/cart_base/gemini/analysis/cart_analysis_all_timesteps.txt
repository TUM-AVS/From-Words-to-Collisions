At t=0.9s, the ego vehicle is at (3.1148, -2345.3422) and the obstacle is at (16.3137, -2337.4546).  While the Y coordinates are converging, the X coordinates are still somewhat separated, approximately 13 units apart.  However, the trajectories over the preceding timesteps show a clear pattern of rapid convergence. Although not an immediate collision at this exact timestep, the rapid approach suggests an extremely high probability of collision within the next few timesteps if both vehicles maintain their current trajectories and velocities. Therefore, obstacle 30656.0 poses an extreme risk (Risk Score 1).
