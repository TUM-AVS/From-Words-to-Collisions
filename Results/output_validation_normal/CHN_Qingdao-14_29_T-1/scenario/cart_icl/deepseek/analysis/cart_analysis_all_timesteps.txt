### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep (0.9 seconds):

### Obstacle Analysis:
- **Obstacle ID**: 30656.0  
  - **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is in the same lanelet (133.0) as the ego vehicle and has been consistently approaching the ego vehicle over the past timesteps. The distance between them has decreased from ~10.3m at 0.1s to ~13.2m at 0.9s.  
  - **Distance safety score**: 2 (High Risk)  
  - **Time Risk reason**: The ego vehicle is decelerating (current acceleration: 0.1099 m/s²), while the obstacle is decelerating more sharply (current acceleration: -3.1926 m/s²). The relative velocity is ~3.5 m/s (ego: 35.2939 m/s, obstacle: 31.7927 m/s). TTC is ~3.77s (distance/relative velocity).  
  - **Time safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk)  
  - **Overall Risk score**: 2 (High Risk)  

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. **Lanelet Proximity**: Both ego and obstacle are in lanelet 133.0, indicating shared trajectory.  
2. **Distance Trend**: Distance between ego and obstacle has been decreasing over time, but not at an alarming rate.  
3. **Velocity/Acceleration**: Ego is maintaining speed (~35 m/s), while obstacle is decelerating sharply. This reduces collision risk.  
4. **TTC**: ~3.77s is sufficient for the ego to react or adjust.  
5. **Conclusion**: No immediate collision risk, but high risk due to proximity and shared lanelet.
