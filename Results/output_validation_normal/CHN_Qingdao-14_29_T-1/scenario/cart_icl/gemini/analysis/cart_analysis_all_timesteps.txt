- Obstacle ID: 30650.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is in a different lanelet and far away.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason:  No time-based risk due to different lanelet.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 30652.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is in the same lanelet and moving in the same direction, but position history shows increasing separation.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Ego vehicle is moving faster but decelerating slightly more than Obstacle 30652.0. Risk is mitigated by the initial separation.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- Obstacle ID: 30653.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is in a different lanelet and far away.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: No time-based risk due to different lanelet.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 30656.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is in the same lanelet and behind the ego vehicle. The distance is decreasing, but not rapidly.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Ego vehicle is moving faster, and the position history shows increasing separation.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4


### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
This is not a collision scenario. All obstacles are either in different lanelets or maintaining a safe distance in the same lanelet.  The historical trajectory data shows no immediate risk of collision.

### Summary in JSON Format:
