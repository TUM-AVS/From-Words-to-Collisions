### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

#### Obstacle 30647.0:
- **Distance Risk reason**: Positioned in lanelet 451.0, far from lanelet 133.0 where the ego is located. Historically has been moving away from ego in the Y direction.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: Low velocity with gradual negative acceleration. Trajectory shows movement away from ego.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

#### Obstacle 30649.0:
- **Distance Risk reason**: Located in lanelet 451.0, sufficiently distant from the ego’s path. Consistent history of being positioned away.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: Low and decreasing velocity indicates a stable path away from the ego. Acceleration changes do not suggest a collision course.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

#### Obstacle 30650.0:
- **Distance Risk reason**: Continued presence in lanelet 451.0, consistently distant and following a predictable route.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: Moderate velocity with slight changes due to deceleration. Path remains clear of the ego.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

#### Obstacle 30652.0:
- **Distance Risk reason**: Shares lanelet 133.0 with ego, but no apparent convergence. The trajectory maintains adequate separation.
- **Distance safety score**: 4
- **Time Risk reason**: High velocity, with a notable deceleration trend. Path divergence assures safety.
- **Time safety score**: 4
- **Overall Risk score**: 4

#### Obstacle 30653.0:
- **Distance Risk reason**: In lanelet 451.0, movements suggest no intersection with ego’s path.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: Consistent low velocity and slight acceleration modifications indicate it remains non-threatening to ego.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

#### Obstacle 30656.0:
- **Distance Risk reason**: Located in lanelet 133.0, with movements suggesting a potential intersection, yet maintains some safe distance.
- **Distance safety score**: 3
- **Time Risk reason**: Moderate velocity with gradual acceleration. Path analysis shows this as manageable with current trajectory.
- **Time safety score**: 4
- **Overall Risk score**: 4

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
- The current analysis reveals that all obstacles either maintain a distance from the ego vehicle or their trajectories suggest no immediate threat of collision.
- Though two obstacles (30652.0 and 30656.0) are in the same lanelet as the ego, their analyzed movement paths, velocities, and accelerations indicate low to medium risk levels.
- The scenario does not present any collision or extreme risk conditions based on the relative paths and velocities.
