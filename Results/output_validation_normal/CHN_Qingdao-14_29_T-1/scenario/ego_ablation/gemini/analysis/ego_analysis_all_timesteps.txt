Obstacle 30656 is behind the ego vehicle and moving away longitudinally.  The lateral distance is consistently zero, suggesting either perfect alignment or an unknown lateral position.  While the lateral velocity and acceleration fluctuate slightly, the consistent longitudinal movement away from the ego vehicle indicates decreasing risk.
