Obstacle 30656 is moving away from the ego vehicle longitudinally, increasing its distance over time.  The lateral distance is consistently zero, suggesting either perfect alignment behind the ego vehicle or an unknown lateral position. Although the relative longitudinal velocity is negative (moving away), the magnitude is decreasing, and at 0.9 seconds there is a positive relative longitudinal acceleration. This might indicate the obstacle is starting to brake or slow its movement away from the ego vehicle. However, there is no immediate danger of collision.
