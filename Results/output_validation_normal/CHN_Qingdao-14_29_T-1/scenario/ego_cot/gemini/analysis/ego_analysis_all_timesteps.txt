### Safety analysis for timestep 0.9 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 30656
- Distance Risk reason: The obstacle is behind the ego vehicle at a longitudinal distance of -10.86m and a lateral distance of -10.86m.  Since it's behind and moving away, there is no immediate distance risk.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: The obstacle is moving away from the ego vehicle longitudinally.  The lateral movement isn't a concern given the longitudinal motion and positioning behind the ego vehicle.  There is no TTC risk as the time to collision is undefined (it's moving away).
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5
