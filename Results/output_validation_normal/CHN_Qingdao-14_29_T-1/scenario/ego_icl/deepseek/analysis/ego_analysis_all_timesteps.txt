### Obstacle-by-Obstacle Analysis

#### Obstacle 30656 (Most Recent Timestep: 0.9 seconds)
- **Position**: Behind ego car
- **Adjusted Distance**: Longitudinal -10.86 m, Lateral 0.00 m
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal -3.51 m/s (moving away), Lateral -0.60 m/s (moving away)
- **Relative Acceleration**: Longitudinal 2.81 m/s², Lateral 1.73 m/s²
- **Motion Description**: Obstacle is moving away longitudinally. Exact lateral alignment or unknown case.

#### Trajectory Analysis
- Over the timesteps (0.1s to 0.9s), the obstacle is consistently moving away from the ego car longitudinally (distance increases from -7.51 m to -10.86 m).
- The lateral distance remains 0.00 m, indicating exact alignment, but the obstacle is moving away laterally as well (negative relative velocity).
- The relative acceleration in both dimensions is positive, meaning the obstacle is decelerating its movement away from the ego car, but it is still moving away.

#### TTC Calculation
- **Longitudinal TTC**: Not applicable (relative velocity is negative, meaning the obstacle is moving away).
- **Lateral TTC**: Not applicable (relative velocity is negative, meaning the obstacle is moving away).

#### MDC Calculation
- Since the obstacle is moving away in both dimensions, the MDC is effectively the current distance.
- **Longitudinal MDC**: 10.86 m (No Risk, MDC > 5.0 m).
- **Lateral MDC**: 0.00 m (but since the obstacle is moving away, this does not indicate a collision risk).

#### Risk Assessment
- **Longitudinal Risk**: 5 (No Risk, MDC > 5.0 m and moving away).
- **Lateral Risk**: 5 (No Risk, despite MDC = 0.00 m, the obstacle is moving away).
- **Overall Risk Score**: 5 (No Risk).

### Conclusion
- The obstacle is moving away from the ego car in both longitudinal and lateral dimensions, with no indication of converging trajectories.
- There is no collision or extreme risk scenario present.
