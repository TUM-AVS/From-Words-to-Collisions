### Obstacle-by-Obstacle Analysis

#### Obstacle 30656

**Trajectory Analysis Across Timesteps:**
- **At 0.0 seconds**: Longitudinal distance is -7.51 meters, moving away with a relative velocity of -5.84 m/s.
- **At 0.9 seconds**: Longitudinal distance is -10.86 meters, still moving away with a relative velocity of -3.51 m/s.

**Most Recent Timestep (0.9 seconds):**
- **Relative Direction**: Behind the ego vehicle.
- **Motion**: Moving away longitudinally.
- **Adjusted Distances**: Not provided, assuming they slightly account for vehicle size.

**Calculations:**

1. **Time-to-Collision (TTC):**
   - **Longitudinal**: Distance = 10.86m (absolute value due to alignment), Relative Velocity = 3.51 m/s
   - **TTC Longitudinal**: 10.86 m / 3.51 m/s = 3.094 seconds
   - **Lateral**: Not significant due to alignment (lateral velocity -0.60 m/s)

2. **Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC):**
   - **Since there's exact lateral alignment and the motion is longitudinally away**, MDC is not relevant in lateral terms, and the relative path doesn't suggest an imminent collision due to increasing distances.

3. **Risk Assessment:**
    - **TTC Longitudinal (3.094 seconds)** corresponds to a Medium Risk due to exact alignment (Risk Score 3 for longitudinal movement).
    - The obstacle is moving away, confirmed by the increasing longitudinal distance over time. 

**Overall Risk Score for Obstacle 30656:** 
- **Lowest Risk Component**: Medium Risk (Score 3)

### Conclusion
- **There is no collision or extreme risk scenario for Obstacle 30656 as the obstacle is moving away, with increasing distance both longitudinally and latitudinally.**
