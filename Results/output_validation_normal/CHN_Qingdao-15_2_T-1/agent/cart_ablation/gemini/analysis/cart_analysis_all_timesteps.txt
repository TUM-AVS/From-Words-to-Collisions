Both the ego vehicle and obstacle 30627.0 are in the same lanelet (420.0) and traveling in roughly the same direction. The obstacle is initially behind the ego vehicle but decelerating much faster than the ego vehicle.

Analyzing the provided data points, the longitudinal distance between the ego vehicle and the obstacle decreases over time. While the exact dimensions of the vehicles aren't provided, the positional data suggests a potential for collision if these trends continue. The obstacle's rapid deceleration while being behind the ego vehicle raises serious concerns.  A collision is not imminent within the provided 0.9-second timeframe, but the risk is rapidly escalating.
