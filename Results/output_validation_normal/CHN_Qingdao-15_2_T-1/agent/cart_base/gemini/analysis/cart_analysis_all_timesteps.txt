The ego vehicle and obstacle 30627.0 are both in the same lanelet (420.0).  The obstacle is initially behind the ego vehicle but closing the distance rapidly due to its higher initial velocity. However, the obstacle's deceleration is significantly greater than the ego vehicle's deceleration.  Looking at the positions over time, the x-coordinates are getting closer, suggesting a potential collision or near miss. By calculating the distance between the ego and the obstacle at each timestep, we can observe the trend:

* **0.1s:**  sqrt((380.4744-371.8737)^2 + (-1599.0763 - -1575.209)^2) ≈ 25.5 meters
* **0.2s:**  sqrt((379.9067-371.2957)^2 + (-1597.5027 - -1573.5608)^2) ≈ 25.0 meters
* **0.3s:** ≈ 24.5 meters
* **0.4s:** ≈ 24.0 meters
* **0.5s:** ≈ 23.6 meters
* **0.6s:** ≈ 23.3 meters
* **0.7s:** ≈ 23.0 meters
* **0.8s:** ≈ 22.7 meters
* **0.9s:** ≈ 22.5 meters

The distance is consistently decreasing. While the rate of decrease is slowing due to the obstacle's deceleration, further projection is needed to determine if a collision is imminent or highly likely within the next few seconds.  Based on the provided data, the risk is currently high but not yet at the extreme or collision level.
