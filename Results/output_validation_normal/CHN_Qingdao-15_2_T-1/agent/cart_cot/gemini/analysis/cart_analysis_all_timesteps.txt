Here's a breakdown of the collision analysis at t=0.9s:

**1. Scenario Understanding:**

Both Ego and Obstacle 30627.0 are traveling in the same lanelet (420.0). The obstacle is ahead of the Ego vehicle and decelerating more rapidly than the Ego vehicle.  We need to determine if the current trends indicate a likely collision.

**2. Metric Calculation at t=0.9s:**

* **Position:**
    * Ego: (375.9824, -1586.6292)
    * Obstacle: (367.8463, -1563.5668)
* **Velocity:**
    * Ego: 16.4699 (We don't have directional components broken out, but they appear to be largely aligned based on orientation)
    * Obstacle: 13.1821
* **Acceleration:**
    * Ego: -0.0011
    * Obstacle: -5.9116

* **Longitudinal Distance:**  |-1586.6292 - (-1563.5668)| = 23.0624 
* **Lateral Distance:** |375.9824 - 367.8463| = 8.1361
* **Approximation of TTC (Longitudinal):** Distance / Relative Velocity  = 23.0624 / (16.4699 - 13.1821) = 7.05s. This assumes that velocities and acceleration don't change drastically for the given timeframe.  The TTC is only a snapshot approximation, not a perfect prediction. Note also that the obstacle is decelerating faster. The relative speed could easily approach zero.

**3. Reasoning:**

While the TTC of approximately 7 seconds seems safe now, the obstacle's rapid deceleration (-5.9116) compared to the ego vehicle's near-zero deceleration (-0.0011) suggests the relative velocity will shrink quickly.  This raises concern about a potential collision in the near future.  However, based on the present moment (0.9s), it doesn't qualify as "Extreme Risk." There is still time for the ego vehicle to react, making it a medium risk at this particular moment.

**4. Prediction:**

Since the obstacle is braking hard, it's reasonable to predict its velocity might approach zero.  A simple forward projection assumes constant acceleration.  Let's consider the relative acceleration is approximately 6 m/s^2 and the relative velocity is 3 m/s. Time to zero relative velocity can be calculated using the equation below. 

Time to zero relative velocity: relative velocity / relative acceleration = 3.2878/5.9105 = 0.556s

From the calculated time to zero relative velocity, we can estimate that the obstacle will be at position 366.4 m, while the ego will be at position 374.9. Therefore, the distance will be 8.5 meters in 0.556 seconds later. With the current trend maintained, the distance will be smaller and smaller in following snapshots.
