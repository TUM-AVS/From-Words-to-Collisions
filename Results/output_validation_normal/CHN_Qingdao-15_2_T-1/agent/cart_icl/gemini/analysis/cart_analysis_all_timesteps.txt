At t=0.9s, the ego vehicle is at (375.9824, -1586.6292) with a velocity of 16.47 m/s and the obstacle (ID 30627) is at (367.8463, -1563.5668) with a velocity of 13.18 m/s.  Both are in the same lanelet (420).

The obstacle is behind the ego vehicle in the longitudinal direction (smaller Y-coordinate) and to the left (smaller X-coordinate).  The longitudinal distance is approximately 23 meters and the lateral distance is approximately 8 meters.

The obstacle's velocity is lower than the ego vehicle's, meaning the ego is pulling away.  Over the observed period, the obstacle's acceleration has been negative and quite strong, while the ego's acceleration is close to zero.  This trend further reduces the risk of a collision.

Given the distances, relative velocities, and the fact that the ego vehicle is moving away from the obstacle, the risk of collision is negligible.
