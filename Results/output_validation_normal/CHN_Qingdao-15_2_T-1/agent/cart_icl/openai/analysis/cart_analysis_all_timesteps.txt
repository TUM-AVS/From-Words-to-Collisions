In the current scenario, we have a single obstacle (30627.0) sharing the same lanelet (420.0) as the ego vehicle (30629.0). Both vehicles are traveling in a similar direction but at different speeds and accelerations.

### Detailed Evaluation:

1. **Position Analysis:**
   - The ego vehicle moves from (381.0436, -1600.6543) towards (375.9824, -1586.6292).
   - The obstacle moves from (371.8737, -1575.209) towards (367.8463, -1563.5668).

2. **Velocity and Acceleration:**
   - **Ego:**
     - Velocity decreases slightly from 16.7595 to 16.4699 m/s.
     - The recent acceleration is minimal at -0.0011 m/s².
   - **Obstacle:**
     - Initial velocity is 17.9091 m/s, decreasing to 13.1821 m/s.
     - The obstacle experiences a significant negative acceleration consistently around -5.9116 m/s².

3. **Orientation:**
   - Both the ego vehicle and obstacle have similar orientation angles, ranging slightly above 1.9 radians, indicating they are aligned in a similar trajectory.

4. **Relative Motion:**
   - The ego vehicle starts behind the obstacle but is decreasing the distance as both continue forward.
   - From 0.1 to 0.9 seconds, the lateral separation remains within the lane boundaries, indicating the vehicles are in the same driving path.

5. **Time-To-Collision (TTC) and Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC):**
   - **Relative longitudinal position at 0.9s:** Ego at -1586.6292 (y-coordinate) vs. Obstacle at -1563.5668 means the ego vehicle has a negative relative distance longitudinally of about 23.0624m, i.e., it's still behind.
   - **Relative velocity longitudinally:** The ego vehicle is slower and decelerating slightly compared to the obstacle's rapid deceleration, making direct collision less immediate.
   - **TTC is difficult to calculate precisely but given the rapid deceleration and initial relative positions, the risk remains low if both vehicles maintain their speeds.**

### Conclusion
The primary factor mitigating risk here is the significant deceleration of the obstacle, allowing the ego vehicle to close in gradually. With consistent reduction in both velocity and overlap distance, this suggests no immediate collision risk present.

### Overall Assessment:
Despite the closeness of both vehicles within the lane (same lanelet and decreasing lateral distances), their respective velocities and deceleration trends mitigate any immediate or high collision risk.

### Output JSON:

```json
{
    "CollisionObstacles": [],
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {},
    "HighRiskObstacle": {}
}
```

There are no obstacles with an overall risk score of 0 or 1 in this scenario. The analysis suggests controlling for gradual deceleration and ensuring lane alignment remains constant.
