At t=0.9s, Obstacle 30627 is 19.95m ahead and laterally aligned with the ego vehicle. Although it's moving towards the ego vehicle longitudinally at -3.29 m/s, the lateral velocity is minimal (-0.20 m/s) and the substantial longitudinal distance suggests there's no immediate danger.  Given the current distance and relative velocities, a collision is unlikely in the next few seconds.  It warrants monitoring, but doesn't pose a high risk yet. The relative acceleration suggests the obstacle might be braking.
