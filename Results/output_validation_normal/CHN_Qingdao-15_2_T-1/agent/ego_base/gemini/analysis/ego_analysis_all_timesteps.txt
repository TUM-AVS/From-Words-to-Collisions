At t=0.9s, obstacle 30627 is in front of the ego vehicle, moving towards it. The longitudinal distance is decreasing rapidly (19.95m), and the relative longitudinal velocity is -3.29 m/s.  While the lateral distance is currently zero, the lateral velocity suggests a slight lateral movement (-0.20 m/s). The consistent relative longitudinal acceleration (around 1.92 m/sÂ²) indicates that the obstacle is braking or decelerating less than the ego vehicle. Given the decreasing distance and negative relative velocity, a collision is possible if the trend continues. This warrants classifying the obstacle as a high risk.
