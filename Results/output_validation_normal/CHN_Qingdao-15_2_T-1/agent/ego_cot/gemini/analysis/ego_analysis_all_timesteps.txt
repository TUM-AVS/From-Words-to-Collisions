### Safety analysis for timestep 0.9s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 30627
- Distance Risk reason:  At 0.9 seconds, the obstacle is 19.95m longitudinally and laterally away from the ego vehicle.  While the obstacle is moving closer, the distance is still significant.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: While the obstacle's longitudinal velocity is negative (approaching the ego vehicle), the current rate and distance suggest ample time to react.  The consistent lateral movement away from the ego vehicle further reduces risk.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4
