### Obstacle Analysis: 30627

#### Trajectory Analysis:
- **Initial State (0.1s):** 
  - Longitudinal distance: 20.86m (moving away at 1.22 m/s)
  - Lateral distance: 0.00m (stable alignment)
- **Final State (0.9s):** 
  - Longitudinal distance: 19.95m (approaching at -3.29 m/s)
  - Lateral distance: 0.00m (stable alignment)
- **Trend:** 
  - The obstacle initially moves away but starts approaching the ego vehicle after 0.4s with increasing relative velocity (-3.29 m/s at 0.9s).
  - Lateral distance remains stable at 0.00m (same lane alignment).

#### Risk Assessment (Most Recent Timestep - 0.9s):
1. **Proximity:**
   - Longitudinal: 19.95m (large distance)
   - Lateral: 0.00m (same lane alignment, but not a collision risk unless longitudinal distance is very small)

2. **Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC):**
   - Since the obstacle is directly in front (lateral = 0.00m), MDC is the longitudinal distance: **19.95m**.
   - MDC > 5.0m → **Risk Level 5 (Negligible Risk)**.

3. **Time-to-Collision (TTC):**
   - TTC = Distance / |Relative Velocity| = 19.95 / 3.29 ≈ **6.06s**.
   - TTC > 5.0s → **Risk Level 5 (Negligible Risk)**.

4. **Acceleration Trend:**
   - The obstacle is accelerating toward the ego vehicle (longitudinal relative acceleration: 1.92 m/s²). However, the current distance and TTC are large enough to mitigate immediate risk.

#### Overall Risk:
- Both MDC and TTC indicate **Negligible Risk (Level 5)**.
- No collision or extreme risk is present.
