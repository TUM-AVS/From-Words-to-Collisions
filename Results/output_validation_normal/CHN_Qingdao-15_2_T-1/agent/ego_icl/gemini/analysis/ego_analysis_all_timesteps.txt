Obstacle 30627 is in front of the ego vehicle and is approaching along the longitudinal axis.  The lateral distance remains at 0.00 m throughout all timesteps, indicating the obstacle and ego vehicle are in the same lane. The longitudinal distance initially increases slightly, but then starts decreasing consistently from 0.4 seconds onwards. The relative longitudinal velocity becomes negative at 0.4 seconds confirming this closing behavior.

At the last timestep (0.9 seconds):
- Longitudinal distance: 19.95m
- Lateral distance: 0.00m
- Longitudinal relative velocity: -3.29 m/s (approaching)
- Lateral relative velocity: -0.20 m/s

TTC Calculation:
- Longitudinal TTC = 19.95m / 3.29 m/s = 6.06 seconds.
- Lateral velocity is not a factor for collision given the paths are aligned.

MDC Calculation:
Since the obstacle is directly in front, MDC is essentially the longitudinal distance, so MDC = 19.95m.

Risk Assessment:
- Based on TTC (6.06s) the risk is Negligible (5).
- Based on MDC (19.95m) the risk is Negligible (5).

Overall Risk: Negligible (5)
