At t=0.9s, the ego vehicle at (375.9824, -1586.6292) and the obstacle 30627.0 at (367.8463, -1563.5668) are in the same lanelet (420.0).  The obstacle is behind the ego vehicle. While the obstacle's deceleration is higher than the ego's, the current distance and velocity difference doesn't suggest an immediate collision risk.  Over the observed time, the obstacle's velocity decreases from 17.9 m/s to 13.18 m/s while the ego's velocity decreases from 16.76 m/s to 16.47 m/s.  This indicates the obstacle is braking harder than the ego vehicle, but not aggressively enough to pose an immediate collision risk within the next second. The distance between them is also increasing.  Therefore, the risk level is assessed as low (4 or 5).
