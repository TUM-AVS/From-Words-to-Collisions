At t=0.9s, the ego vehicle is at (375.9824, -1586.6292) and the obstacle (ID 30627.0) is at (367.8463, -1563.5668).  The obstacle is behind the ego vehicle and also slightly to its right. Both are moving in roughly the same direction (similar orientations) and, importantly, the obstacle is decelerating much faster than the ego vehicle.  While the current separation doesn't pose an immediate collision risk, the rapid deceleration of the obstacle combined with its trailing position makes a future collision plausible if this trend continues. Therefore, I'd classify this as a medium risk (3), not an extreme risk (1).
