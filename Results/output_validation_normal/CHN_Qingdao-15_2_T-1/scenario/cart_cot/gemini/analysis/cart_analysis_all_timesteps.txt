### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 30627.0
- Distance Risk reason: At the most recent timestep (0.9 seconds), the obstacle is approximately 8.14 meters behind the ego vehicle in the same lane.  While the distance is not extremely large, over the past 0.9 seconds, the obstacle has been consistently behind the ego vehicle and decelerating more rapidly than the ego vehicle. This suggests the risk of collision is decreasing.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: The obstacle's velocity is decreasing faster than the ego vehicle's velocity.  This trend, observed over multiple timesteps, indicates the time to collision is increasing, further reducing the risk.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. **Most critical obstacle:** Obstacle 30627.0 is the only obstacle identified in the scenario and shares the same lanelet as the ego vehicle.
2. **Trajectory analysis:** Over the 10 timesteps, both the ego vehicle and the obstacle are moving in the same general direction. The obstacle starts slightly closer to the ego vehicle but consistently remains behind it. Both are decelerating, but the obstacle decelerates more aggressively.
3. **Relative position, velocity, and acceleration:** The obstacle remains behind the ego vehicle, and the distance between them appears to be increasing.  The obstacle's velocity is lower than the ego vehicle's, and its deceleration is greater.
4. **Collision determination:** Based on the provided data, there is no collision in the current timeframe, and the risk of a future collision appears low given the observed trajectories and relative decelerations.
5. **Reasoning:** The obstacle consistently remains behind the ego vehicle and is decelerating faster.  This implies the relative distance is increasing and the time to collision, if any, is far in the future.
