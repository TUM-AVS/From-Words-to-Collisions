### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep:  
Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.  

### Obstacle Analysis:  
- **Obstacle ID**: 30627.0  
  - **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is in the same lanelet (420.0) as the ego vehicle. Over the past 9 timesteps, the distance between the ego and the obstacle has been decreasing, but the lateral separation remains significant (≈10m). The obstacle is ahead of the ego but decelerating rapidly.  
  - **Distance safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk)  
  - **Time Risk reason**: The relative velocity is decreasing (ego: 16.47 m/s, obstacle: 13.18 m/s). The obstacle is decelerating much faster than the ego (-5.91 m/s² vs. -0.001 m/s²). Given the current distance (~23m) and relative speed (~3.3 m/s), TTC ≈ 7s (longitudinally safe).  
  - **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)  
  - **Overall Risk score**: 3 (Medium Risk)  

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:  
1. **Same Lanelet**: Both ego and obstacle are in lanelet 420.0.  
2. **Trajectory**: The obstacle is ahead but decelerating rapidly, increasing separation over time.  
3. **Relative Motion**: The ego is maintaining speed (~16.5 m/s), while the obstacle is slowing down (~13.2 m/s).  
4. **Collision Risk**: Low, as the obstacle is moving away longitudinally and lateral separation is maintained.
