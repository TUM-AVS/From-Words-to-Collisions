### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 30627.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 30627.0 is in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle and its y-coordinate is getting closer to the ego vehicle over time, indicating a potential longitudinal collision risk. However, at the last timestep, there is still a safe distance between them.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Although the obstacle's velocity is decreasing, the relative velocity between the ego vehicle and the obstacle is still somewhat high, suggesting a moderate risk in terms of time to collision.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3

- Obstacle ID: 30628.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 30628.0 is in a different lanelet and poses no immediate threat. The distance in the x-coordinate between ego and the obstacle is significant and there is no risk observed based on lateral position change.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: This obstacle shows little change in its Y position during the scenario, indicating no risk of collision in the near future.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
This is not a collision scenario.  No obstacle has a risk score of 0. While obstacle 30627.0 presents a medium risk due to its proximity and relative velocity in the same lane, it is not on a direct collision course in the immediate future based on current trajectory.
