### Obstacle Analysis:

#### Obstacle ID: 30627
- **Distance Risk Reason**: Obstacle 30627 is in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle throughout the current t = 0.9 seconds. The obstacle has been gradually closing in, based on its position changes over time. The Ego and Obstacle 30627 remain longitudinally aligned, with a relatively short gap.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 3 (Medium Risk)
- **Time Risk Reason**: The obstacle's velocity decreased over time, with a negative acceleration indicating deceleration. Nevertheless, it is still traveling relatively slowly compared to the ego vehicle, diminishing likelihood of imminent collision.
- **Time Safety Score**: 4 (Low Risk)
- **Overall Risk Score**: 3 (Medium Risk)

#### Obstacle ID: 30628
- **Distance Risk Reason**: This obstacle is on a different lanelet (415) compared to the ego vehicle and is moving laterally away from the lane containing the ego, maintaining a safe distance constantly.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- **Time Risk Reason**: Despite initial deceleration, there has been acceleration in recent timesteps, changing its velocity trend, but still moving laterally away, reducing the risk of time-based collision.
- **Time Safety Score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- **Overall Risk Score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
- **Step 1**: Observed both obstacle positions relative to the ego vehicle over time.
- **Step 2**: Analyzed current velocities and accelerations of the obstacles.
- **Step 3**: Calculated risk levels based on proximity and trajectory comparison.
- **Step 4**: Concluded that no obstacles were on a collision course with the ego vehicle due to trajectories and timely deceleration trends.
- **Collision Scenario**: No, the scenario does not manifest a collision due to maintained safe distances and different trajectories.
