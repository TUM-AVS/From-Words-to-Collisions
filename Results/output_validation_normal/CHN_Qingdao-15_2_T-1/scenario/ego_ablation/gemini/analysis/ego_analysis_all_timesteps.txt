Obstacle 30627 is initially moving away from the ego vehicle but starts approaching it around 0.4 seconds. In the last provided timestep (0.9 seconds), it's approximately 20 meters ahead and closing at a relative longitudinal speed of -3.29 m/s.  While it has a slightly negative lateral velocity, the magnitude is small (-0.20 m/s) and it maintains longitudinal alignment ("Exact lateral alignment or unknown case"). Given the closing speed and persistent longitudinal alignment, there is a potential for collision if this trend continues. However, at 20m with less than 1 second of data, a collision is not imminent but the risk is increasing rapidly.
