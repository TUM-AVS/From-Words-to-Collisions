### Safety analysis for timestep 0.9 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 30627
- Distance Risk reason:  At 0.9 seconds, the obstacle is 19.95m longitudinally and laterally away from the ego vehicle. While this distance is significant, the obstacle's motion and relative velocity suggest a potential future risk if the current trend continues. The "Exact lateral alignment or unknown case" statement raises some concern, as lateral movement is uncertain.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: The obstacle's longitudinal relative velocity is -3.29 m/s (moving towards the ego vehicle), and its longitudinal relative acceleration is 1.92 m/sÂ² (accelerating towards the ego vehicle). This acceleration indicates the closing speed will increase.  We don't have enough information to determine precise TTC values, but the combination of decreasing distance and increasing closing speed warrants attention. Lateral velocity (-0.20 m/s) is slight, but the "Exact lateral alignment" warning introduces uncertainty.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3


### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
  "CollisionObstacle": null,
  "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null,
  "IsCollisionScenario": false,
  "Justification": "While the obstacle is currently at a safe distance, its motion, relative velocity, and acceleration suggest a potential risk of collision in the near future if the trend continues. Therefore, it is not a collision scenario at this exact moment, but close monitoring and potential intervention may be required soon."
