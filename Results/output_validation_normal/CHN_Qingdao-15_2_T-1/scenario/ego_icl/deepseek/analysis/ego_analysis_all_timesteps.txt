### Obstacle-by-Obstacle Analysis (Most Recent Timestep: 0.9s)

#### **Obstacle 30627 (Front of ego car)**
- **Adjusted Distances**: 
  - Longitudinal: 19.95 m (raw: 19.95 m)
  - Lateral: 0.00 m (raw: 0.00 m)
- **Relative Velocity**: 
  - Longitudinal: -3.29 m/s (approaching ego)
  - Lateral: -0.20 m/s (minor lateral movement)
- **Relative Acceleration**: 
  - Longitudinal: 1.92 m/s² (increasing closing speed)
  - Lateral: -5.59 m/s² (lateral movement stabilizing)
- **Motion Description**: 
  - "Obstacle is driving toward the ego car longitudinally. Exact lateral alignment or unknown case."

### **Trajectory Analysis (0.0s to 0.9s)**
1. **Longitudinal Distance**: 
   - Initially increases slightly (20.86m → 20.96m at 0.3s), then decreases steadily (20.93m → 19.95m at 0.9s).
   - Relative velocity becomes negative at 0.4s, indicating the obstacle is now closing in on the ego.
   - Closing speed accelerates (from -0.36 m/s to -3.29 m/s).

2. **Lateral Distance**: 
   - Remains 0.00 m (exact alignment) with negligible lateral velocity (-0.08 m/s → -0.20 m/s).

### **Risk Assessment Calculations**
#### **Time-to-Collision (TTC)**
- **Longitudinal TTC**: 
  - Distance: 19.95 m
  - Relative Velocity: 3.29 m/s (absolute value)
  - TTC = 19.95 / 3.29 ≈ **6.06 seconds** (No Risk, TTC > 5.0s)
- **Lateral TTC**: 
  - Not applicable (lateral distance stable at 0.00m with minimal movement).

#### **Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC)**
- **Primary Focus**: Longitudinal distance (lateral alignment is exact but stable).
- **MDC**: 19.95 m (No Risk, MDC > 5.0m).

#### **Overall Risk**
- **TTC**: 5 (No Risk)
- **MDC**: 5 (No Risk)
- **Overall Risk Score**: **5 (No Risk)**  
  - Despite closing longitudinally, the distance is large (>19m) and TTC is high (>6s). Lateral alignment is exact but poses no immediate risk.

---

### **Collision Scenario Determination**
- No obstacle has a risk score of 0 (collision) or 1 (extreme risk).
- Obstacle 30627 is closing but remains at a safe distance with no imminent collision risk.
