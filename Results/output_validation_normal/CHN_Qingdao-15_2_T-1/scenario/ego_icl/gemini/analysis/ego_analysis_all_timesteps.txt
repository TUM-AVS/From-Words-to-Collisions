Obstacle 30627 Analysis:

Trajectory Analysis:
- The obstacle starts approximately 20.86m in front of the ego vehicle and laterally aligned (0.00m lateral distance).
- Initially, it moves slightly away from the ego vehicle longitudinally, but from 0.4 seconds onward, it begins approaching the ego vehicle.
- Lateral movement is minimal and slightly towards the ego vehicle's left.
- The obstacle is consistently in front of the ego vehicle.

Most Recent Timestep (0.9 seconds):

- Longitudinal distance: 19.95m
- Lateral distance: 0.00m
- Longitudinal relative velocity: -3.29 m/s (approaching)
- Lateral relative velocity: -0.20 m/s (slightly approaching)

TTC Calculation:
- Longitudinal TTC: 19.95m / 3.29 m/s â‰ˆ 6.06 seconds
- Lateral TTC not applicable - the lateral distance remains virtually zero and the motion description repeatedly states "Exact lateral alignment," indicating that any negative lateral velocity is negligible and possibly caused by rounding error.

MDC Calculation:
- Given the obstacle is directly in front and the concern is longitudinal closing speed, we primarily use longitudinal distance, MDC = 19.95 meters.


Risk Assessment:
- Longitudinal Risk: Low Risk (4) based on TTC > 5s and MDC > 5m
- Lateral Risk: No Risk (5) - The continued exact lateral alignment suggests no immediate lateral collision risk.

Overall Risk: Low Risk (4) - Dominated by the longitudinal risk.

Collision Scenario Determination:

This is NOT a collision scenario. No obstacle has a risk score of 0 or 1.
