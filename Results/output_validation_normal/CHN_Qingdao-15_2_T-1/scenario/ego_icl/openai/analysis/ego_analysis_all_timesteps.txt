### Obstacle-by-Obstacle Analysis

#### Obstacle 30627:
- **Position and Motion Description:**
  - At the most recent timestep (0.9 seconds), the obstacle is in front of the ego vehicle.
  - Adjusted longitudinal distance: 19.95 meters, adjusted lateral distance: 0.00 meters.
  - Relative velocity: longitudinal -3.29 m/s (approaching), lateral -0.20 m/s (slightly converging).
  - The motion describes the obstacle as driving toward the ego vehicle longitudinally.

- **Trajectory Analysis:**
  - From 0.0 to 0.9 seconds, the obstacle initially moved away (increasing distances), then started moving toward the ego vehicle from 0.4 seconds onwards.
  - Longitudinal distance decreased from 20.96 m (at 0.3 s) to 19.95 m (at 0.9 s), indicating a continued approach.
  - Lateral position is perfectly aligned for the entire duration; no movement laterally but described as converging slightly.

- **Calculation of Time-to-Collision (TTC) and Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC):**
  - **Longitudinal TTC:**
    - TTC_longitudinal = adjusted_distance_longitudinal / |relative_velocity_longitudinal|
    - TTC_longitudinal = 19.95 m / 3.29 m/s â‰ˆ 6.06 seconds

  - **Lateral TTC:**
    - Given near-zero relative lateral velocity and alignment, focus is placed on longitudinal TTC.
  
  - **MDC:**
    - Based on longitudinal distance since lateral is 0.00 m and stable.
    - MDC = longitudinal distance = 19.95 meters
  
- **Risk Assessment:**
  - Longitudinal TTC suggests the risk level is more cautious as the obstacle approaches slowly.
  - The MDC > 5.0 meters further confirms no immediate collision risk in terms of proximity.
  - Since the longitudinal TTC is greater than 5.0 seconds and MDC > 5.0 meters with consistent paths described by motion, the current risk states:
    - Longitudinal Risk: 5 (No Risk)

### Conclusion:
- The obstacle 30627 does not currently pose a collision risk.
- **Risk Scores:**
  - Longitudinal: No Risk (5)
- **Overall Assessment:** This is not identified as a collision scenario.
