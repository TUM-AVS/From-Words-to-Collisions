Obstacle 30683 is in the adjacent lane (lanelet 125) and its y-coordinate is getting closer to the ego vehicle's y-coordinate over time.  Its x-coordinate is also approaching the ego vehicle's x-coordinate, suggesting a possible lane change or cut-in by obstacle 30683. Given its relatively high velocity and acceleration, combined with the ego vehicle's deceleration, this obstacle presents a high risk of collision in the near future.

Obstacle 30693 is in the same lane as the ego vehicle (lanelet 124). Although initially further behind, it's accelerating while the ego vehicle is decelerating. The decreasing distance between the two, along with the difference in velocities and acceleration, suggests an increasing risk of a rear-end collision if these trends continue.  It's currently a medium risk, but could quickly become a high risk in the next few timesteps.

Obstacle 30695 is also in the same lane as the ego vehicle (lanelet 124) and further behind than 30693.  While its velocity is relatively close to the ego vehicle's, its trajectory and acceleration do not indicate an immediate threat level like 30693.  Therefore, it remains a lower risk than 30693.
