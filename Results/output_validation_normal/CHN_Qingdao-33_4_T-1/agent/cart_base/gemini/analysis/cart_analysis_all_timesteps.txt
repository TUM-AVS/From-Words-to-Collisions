Obstacle 30683 is consistently in a different lane (125) than the ego vehicle (124), and while its lateral distance isn't enormous, it maintains a safe separation. Its high velocity and acceleration primarily contribute to longitudinal risk, which is mitigated by the lane separation. Obstacles 30693 and 30695 are in the same lane as the ego vehicle, but their positions and velocities suggest they are behind the ego vehicle and pose less immediate risk.  The other obstacles are sufficiently far laterally to not pose an immediate risk. Although the ego vehicle's velocity is decreasing, it's not decreasing at a rate that would cause an imminent collision within the predicted timeframe.
