Here's a collision risk analysis of the provided scenario, focusing on the last timestep (0.9 seconds) and considering the trajectories from previous timesteps:

**Ego Vehicle State at t=0.9s:**

* Position: (456.7276, -2126.4976)
* Velocity: 3.3357 (magnitude)
* Acceleration: -1.0378
* Orientation: 2.2141 radians


**Obstacles Analysis at t=0.9s:**

* **Obstacle 30676:** Static, far from ego, no risk.  Position: (433.2693, -2113.172). Risk Score: 5

* **Obstacle 30683:**  Moving with a high velocity (12.5608) towards the ego vehicle's lane and exhibiting a lateral motion in the last several timestamps which brings it even closer to the ego-vehicle's projected trajectory along the lane center-line. The continuous positive acceleration (1.2929) suggests this trend will continue. There is a high chance of collision in the next couple of timesteps as it cuts across the ego vehicleâ€™s path. Position: (462.0524, -2141.4627). Risk Score: 1 (Extreme Risk)

* **Obstacle 30686:** Static, moderately far from ego, no immediate risk. Position: (450.7345, -2102.6252). Risk Score: 5

* **Obstacle 30687:**  Almost static, far from ego, no risk. Position: (458.3491, -2101.9445). Risk Score: 5

* **Obstacle 30688:** Moving slowly, far from ego, no risk. Position: (466.4173, -2101.2232). Risk Score: 5

* **Obstacle 30690:**  Moving, but its trajectory suggests divergence from the ego vehicle's path. Position: (450.136, -2113.8728). Risk Score: 4

* **Obstacle 30693:**  Following the ego vehicle in the same lane, but with a slightly higher velocity (6.3014) which combined with the ego's velocity suggests a converging trend. The recent braking maneuver by the ego vehicle, further highlighted by its negative acceleration (-1.0378), along with obstacle 30693's negative acceleration (-2.0812), suggests a risk mitigation effort but requires close monitoring. Position: (463.843, -2137.2692). Risk Score: 3 (Medium Risk)

* **Obstacle 30695:** Following the ego vehicle in the same lane at a similar y-position, but x-position poses some risk. Continuous monitoring is needed. Position: (468.4567, -2149.5825). Risk Score: 4
