### Analysis:

1. **Obstacle 30683 (ID: 30683)**:
   - **Position**: (462.0524, -2141.4627) at 0.9s, moving towards ego's lane (lanelet 125).
   - **Velocity**: 12.5608 m/s (high speed).
   - **Relative Motion**: Closing distance rapidly from previous timesteps.
   - **TTC**: Estimated < 1s due to high relative velocity and proximity.
   - **Risk**: **Extreme Risk (1)** - Immediate collision likely if trajectories intersect.

2. **Obstacle 30693 (ID: 30693)**:
   - **Position**: (463.843, -2137.2692) at 0.9s, same lanelet as ego (124).
   - **Velocity**: 6.3014 m/s (decelerating).
   - **Relative Motion**: Ego is decelerating faster, but obstacle is still approaching.
   - **TTC**: ~2s (manageable but close).
   - **Risk**: **High Risk (2)** - Needs quick action to avoid collision.

3. **Obstacle 30690 (ID: 30690)**:
   - **Position**: (450.136, -2113.8728) at 0.9s, lanelet 859 (adjacent to ego's lane).
   - **Velocity**: 5.7523 m/s (moderate speed).
   - **Relative Motion**: Lateral distance is significant, but trajectory could intersect.
   - **TTC**: > 3s.
   - **Risk**: **Medium Risk (3)** - Manageable with proper reaction.

4. **Other Obstacles (30681, 30686, 30687, 30688, 30695)**:
   - Either stationary or moving away from ego's path.
   - **Risk**: **Low to Negligible (4-5)**.
