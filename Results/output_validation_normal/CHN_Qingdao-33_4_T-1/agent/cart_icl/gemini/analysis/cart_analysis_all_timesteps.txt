At t=0.9s, Obstacle 30683 shows the highest risk. It's in a neighboring lanelet (125) and moving faster than the ego vehicle with a lateral distance that appears to be decreasing. More data points are needed to accurately calculate TTC and MDC, but the current information suggests a potential lane change conflict. Obstacles 30693 and 30695 are in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle and appear to be maintaining a safe distance. They don't present an immediate risk. Obstacle 30690 in lanelet 859, may or may not represent a risk depending on the lanelet geometry and ego vehicle's intended path. Other obstacles are either stationary or far enough to present minimal risk.
