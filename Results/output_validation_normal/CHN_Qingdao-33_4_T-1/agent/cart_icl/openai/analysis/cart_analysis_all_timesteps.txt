### Analysis

Let's evaluate each obstacle relative to the ego vehicle focusing primarily on the most recent timestep (0.9 seconds):

1. **Ego Vehicle (30692.0)**
   - At 0.9 seconds, position: (456.7276, -2126.4976), orientation: 2.2141, velocity: 3.3357, acceleration: -1.0378.

2. **Obstacle 30683.0**
   - Position: (462.0524, -2141.4627), velocity: 12.5608.
   - Relative longitudinal position: ~15m ahead.
   - Relative position suggests it's in a nearby lane (lanelet 125 vs. 124 for ego).
   - TTC isn't directly calculable as the motion is not directly towards the ego.
   - Risk: **Low (4)** due to separation and lane difference.

3. **Obstacle 30690.0**
   - Position: (450.136, -2113.8728), velocity: 5.7523
   - Relative longitudinal position: ~12m ahead but in lanelet 859 (different lanelet).
   - Relative speed indicates separation is increasing.
   - Risk: **Negligible (5)** as separation is stable and increasing in distance.

4. **Obstacle 30693.0**
   - Position: (463.843, -2137.2692), velocity: 6.3014.
   - Similar lanelet as ego (124) and closing in.
   - Relative approach: ~11m difference at a moderate relative speed.
   - Risk: **Medium (3)** as there is a possible future convergence, but not immediate.

5. **Obstacle 30695.0**
   - Position: (468.4567, -2149.5825), velocity: 6.0494.
   - Obstacle ahead, ~23m separation.
   - Parallel or diverging path allows safe separation.
   - Risk: **Low (4)** due to separation and likely path divergence.

6. **Stationary Obstacles (30686.0, 30676.0) and others (30687, 30688)**
   - Obstacle 30686.0 remains stationary far away.
   - Other obstacles (87, 88) in lanelet 296 does not pose immediate threat due to their distant position from Ego.

### Risk Evaluation
- No obstacles at risk levels 0 or 1 as of the current trajectory and separation distances assessed.
