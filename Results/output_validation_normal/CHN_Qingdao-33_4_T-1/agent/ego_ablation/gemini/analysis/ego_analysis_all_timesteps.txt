At t=0.9s, Obstacle 30693 is the closest to the ego vehicle with a longitudinal distance of -8.38m (behind the ego) and a lateral distance of 0.00m. It's approaching the ego with a longitudinal relative velocity of 2.89 m/s.  While it is relatively close, the data suggests it is moving towards the rear of the ego vehicle, not directly into its path. Therefore, it's not classified as a high risk. No other obstacles pose an immediate collision risk. Although some obstacles are moving towards the ego vehicle, their distances and relative velocities suggest sufficient time for the ego vehicle to react and avoid a collision.
