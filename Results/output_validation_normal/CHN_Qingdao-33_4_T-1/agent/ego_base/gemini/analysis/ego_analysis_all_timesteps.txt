Obstacle 30688 is closest to the ego vehicle longitudinally (9.90 m) and approaching at -3.02 m/s.  Given its lateral distance of -21.30 m and lateral velocity of 0.50 m/s, a collision is unlikely in the immediate future. However, continuous monitoring is necessary. Obstacle 30690 is also relatively close longitudinally (9.55m) and moving towards the ego vehicle. It's lateral velocity (-5.33 m/s) suggests it is moving away from the ego vehicle and does not present an immediate risk. All other obstacles are further away and do not pose an immediate collision risk within the observed timeframe.
