### Safety analysis for timestep 0.9s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

**Assumptions and Clarifications:**

* Since "adjusted distances" are explicitly requested but not provided in the scenario description, the provided longitudinal and lateral distances will be used directly.  A real-world implementation would require the adjusted distances.
* TTC will be calculated using the simple formula: `TTC = Distance / Relative Velocity`.  If `Relative Velocity` is zero or moves away from the ego vehicle, TTC is considered infinite (no collision risk in that direction). Negative TTC values indicate the obstacle is moving away.
* A more sophisticated analysis would consider deceleration capabilities and predict future trajectories.  This analysis uses a simplified approach based on current velocities and positions.
* Thresholds for risk scores are determined based on general safety guidelines.  These can be adjusted based on specific requirements.
