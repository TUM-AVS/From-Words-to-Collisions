Obstacle 30676: Located Front-Left, with longitudinal distance of 20.23m and lateral distance of 9.17m.  No immediate risk. Trajectory shows it is approaching longitudinally but lateral distance is maintained. Risk Level 5.

Obstacle 30683: Located Rear-Left, moving away longitudinally (-10.66m) and laterally (3.11m). No collision risk. Risk Level 5.

Obstacle 30686: Located Front-Right, longitudinally approaching (18.19m) with lateral distance -7.91m.  No immediate risk, but warrants monitoring due to longitudinal approach. Risk Level 5.

Obstacle 30687: Located Front-Right, longitudinally approaching (14.17m) and slightly laterally approaching (-14.42m). No immediate risk, but needs monitoring due to approach in both directions. Risk Level 5.

Obstacle 30688:  Located Front-Right, longitudinally approaching (9.90m) and slightly laterally approaching (-21.30).  While the longitudinal distance is below 10m, the lateral distance suggests it may not pose an immediate threat if the current trajectories are maintained. Risk Level 4.

Obstacle 30690: Located Front-Right, longitudinally approaching at 9.55m and laterally moving away (-0.69m).  Requires attention due to longitudinal proximity, but the lateral movement is slightly reassuring. Risk Level 4.

Obstacle 30693: Located Behind, longitudinally approaching at -8.38m with exact lateral alignment. Needs close monitoring due to proximity and approach from behind, even though lateral movement is minimal. Risk Level 4.

Obstacle 30695: Located Rear-Left, moving closer longitudinally (-21.00m) and laterally approaching at 2.85m. No immediate concern, but continued observation is necessary. Risk Level 5.
