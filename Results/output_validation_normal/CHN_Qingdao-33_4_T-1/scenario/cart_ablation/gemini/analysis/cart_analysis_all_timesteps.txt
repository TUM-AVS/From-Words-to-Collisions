Obstacle 30683 is in the adjacent lane (lanelet 125) and its trajectory suggests it will likely cross the ego vehicle's path soon.  Given its velocity (12.5608) and proximity (lateral distance is small and closing), a collision in the next few moments is highly probable if both vehicles maintain their current course.

Obstacle 30693 is in the same lane as the ego vehicle (lanelet 124) and moderately close. While its velocity (6.3014) is lower than the ego's previous velocity, the ego vehicle is braking hard. Depending on the exact lateral positioning, there is a possibility of a rear-end collision if the ego continues to decelerate rapidly and the obstacle does not react. This is high risk, but not as immediately dangerous as 30683.
