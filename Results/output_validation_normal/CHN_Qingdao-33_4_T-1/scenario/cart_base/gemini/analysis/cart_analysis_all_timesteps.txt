Obstacle 30683 is in the adjacent lane (lanelet 125) and its trajectory suggests it's moving towards the ego vehicle's lane.  Given its velocity (12.5608) and proximity (lateral distance is small, though precise calculation is not possible with this data), a lane change by this obstacle or a slight deviation by the ego vehicle could lead to an immediate collision.

Obstacle 30693 is in the same lane as the ego vehicle (lanelet 124). While it's behind the ego vehicle, the ego vehicle is decelerating significantly (velocity 3.3357, acceleration -1.0378) and obstacle 30693 has higher velocity (6.3014), suggesting a possible rear-end collision in the near future if these trends continue.

  "ScenarioAnalysis": {
    "IsCollisionScenario": false,
    "Reasoning": "Obstacle 30683 in the adjacent lane poses an extreme risk due to its high velocity and trajectory towards the ego vehicle's lane. Obstacle 30693, while behind the ego vehicle, also presents a high risk due to the ego vehicle's rapid deceleration and the obstacle's higher velocity, increasing the likelihood of a rear-end collision."
