### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:

- Obstacle ID: 30676.0
- Distance Risk reason:  Far from ego vehicle and stationary. No risk observed over the provided timesteps.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Stationary. No time-based risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 30683.0
- Distance Risk reason: Located in a different lanelet (125) than the ego vehicle (124).  While relatively close laterally, the obstacle consistently remains in its lane and is moving away longitudinally based on past trajectory.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: The obstacle is moving faster than the ego vehicle, but the trajectories don't intersect based on current data and historical trend.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- Obstacle ID: 30688.0
- Distance Risk reason: Located far from the ego vehicle. No observed risk over the timesteps.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Moving slowly and not towards the ego vehicle.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 30690.0
- Distance Risk reason: Located in a different lanelet (859 at last timestep, transitioned from 860) than the ego vehicle (124). Lateral distance is significant, with no indication of converging trajectories.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Moving at a similar speed to the ego vehicle but diverging paths based on history.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 30693.0
- Distance Risk reason: Located in the same lanelet (124) as the ego vehicle but sufficiently behind it. The distance has been increasing consistently over the provided timestamps.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: While generally traveling at similar speeds, the historical trend shows increasing separation. No immediate time-related risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 30695.0
- Distance Risk reason:  Located in the same lanelet (124) and behind the ego vehicle, but with a safe following distance.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Traveling at a similar speed as the ego vehicle, maintaining a safe following distance based on observed trends.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4


### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. **Most critical obstacles:** Obstacles 30693.0 and 30695.0 are in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle, making them initially appear potentially critical. Obstacle 30683.0 is in an adjacent lane and is moving faster than the ego vehicle, making it worth monitoring.
2. **Trajectory Analysis:** Over the 10 timesteps, both 30693.0 and 30695.0 consistently remain behind the ego vehicle and maintain or increase their following distance. Obstacle 30683.0 consistently remains in its lane and moves further ahead of the ego vehicle.
3. **Relative Positions, Velocities, and Accelerations:** The relative positions and velocities of the most critical obstacles show no sign of convergence towards a collision point.  The ego vehicle's deceleration is a factor, but it does not appear to create a hazardous situation given the existing separation and the other vehicles' behaviors.
4. **Collision Determination:** No collision has occurred or is imminent based on the provided data.
5. **Reasoning:**  The historical data demonstrates a safe and predictable traffic flow. Even though the ego vehicle is decelerating, the surrounding vehicles in the same lane maintain a safe following distance. The obstacle in the adjacent lane is moving away, presenting no immediate risk.
