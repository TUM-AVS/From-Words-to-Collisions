   - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 5

8. **Obstacle ID: 30693.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Same lanelet (124.0) as ego, but behind and decelerating.
   - **Distance safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: Decelerating (6.3 m/s) but still closing distance.
   - **Time safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 3

9. **Obstacle ID: 30695.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Same lanelet (124.0) as ego, but behind and decelerating.
   - **Distance safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: Decelerating (6.05 m/s) but still closing distance.
   - **Time safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 3

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. **Obstacle 30683.0** is the primary concern: high velocity (12.56 m/s) and adjacent lanelet (125.0) with trajectory converging towards ego's path.
2. **Obstacles 30693.0 and 30695.0** are in the same lanelet but decelerating and pose medium risk.
3. All other obstacles are either static or moving away from ego's trajectory.
4. No collision has occurred yet, but **30683.0** is at extreme risk due to its trajectory and speed.
