### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
No obstacles pose an immediate collision risk. Obstacle 30683 shows moderate risk due to lateral proximity and relative speed, requiring monitoring. However, the ego vehicle's deceleration is increasing separation. The scenario is not a collision scenario.

### Summary in JSON Format:
