### Obstacle Analysis:

#### Obstacle 30677
- **Distance Risk reason**: Continues to stay distant from ego vehicle's lanelet and maintains a high speed away from the ego. 
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: Its high velocity indicates movement away from the ego, reducing probable collision imminently.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

#### Obstacle 30683
- **Distance Risk reason**: Positioned further from the ego's lanelet and mainly moving away over time despite occasional proximity trends.
- **Distance safety score**: 4
- **Time Risk reason**: Velocity suggests an increasing distance trend from ego vehicle over time; controlled acceleration.
- **Time safety score**: 4
- **Overall Risk score**: 4

#### Obstacle 30690
- **Distance Risk reason**: Shows a significant distance from ego, despite being in the forward-moving direction relative to ego's lanechange path.
- **Distance safety score**: 4
- **Time Risk reason**: Deceleration noted recently, suggesting actively managing speed likely not leading to collision trajectory.
- **Time safety score**: 4
- **Overall Risk score**: 4
  
#### Obstacle 30691
- **Distance Risk reason**: Positioned in parallel lanes, showing stable separation from the ego's intended path.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: Consistent velocity, suggestive of a constant separation maintained over time.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

#### Obstacle 30693
- **Distance Risk reason**: Slight risk due to variations in positioning that sometimes bring it into closer proximity with ego's trajectory.
- **Distance safety score**: 3
- **Time Risk reason**: Speed patterns suggest potential for shifting paths that could increase risk if slowing.
- **Time safety score**: 3
- **Overall Risk score**: 3

#### Obstacle 30695
- **Distance Risk reason**: Experiences trends that continuously calculate distancing further from ego, indicating minimal risk.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: Acceleration portrays constant separation growth indicating no collision threat.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
- Analyzed over historical data, none of the obstacles depict a credible risk of imminent collision with the ego vehicle. Ego has effectively maintained or increased its separation from other obstacles largely, allowing time for further reactions if necessary.
