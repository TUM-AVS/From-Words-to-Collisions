Obstacle 30693 is approaching the ego from behind longitudinally, with a decreasing longitudinal distance from -8.38m to -9.65 across the provided timesteps. Though the lateral distance is approximately zero, the lateral velocity is -0.99 m/s, there is a chance of collision.

Obstacle 30690 is in front of the ego vehicle with longitudinal distance of 9.55m and a small lateral distance of -0.69 m. It shows a longitudinal closing velocity of -1.17 m/s and lateral relative velocity of -5.33 m/s moving away from the ego, which poses some risk.

Obstacle 30688 is located at longitudinal distance of 9.90 m and lateral distance of -21.30 m relative to the ego vehicle, moving with longitudinal relative velocity -3.02 m/s and lateral relative velocity of 0.50 m/s towards the ego vehicle. This poses some risk but less than obstacle 30690 and 30693.
