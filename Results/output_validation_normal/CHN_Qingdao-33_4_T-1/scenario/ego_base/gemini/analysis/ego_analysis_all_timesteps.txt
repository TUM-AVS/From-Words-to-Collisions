Obstacle 30688 is closest to the ego vehicle longitudinally (9.90 m) and approaching at -3.02 m/s.  It's also relatively close laterally (-21.30 m) and moving towards the ego car laterally at 0.50 m/s. This obstacle warrants attention.

Obstacle 30690 is also quite close longitudinally (9.55m) and approaching at -1.17 m/s.  While it's moving away laterally (-5.33 m/s), the lateral distance is small (-0.69 m), making it potentially risky. 

Obstacle 30693 is approaching the ego vehicle from behind at 2.89 m/s and is longitudinally close (-8.38 m). Although it's currently at the same lateral position, its motion needs to be monitored.

None of these obstacles are extremely close or indicate an unavoidable collision in the immediate next timestep.
