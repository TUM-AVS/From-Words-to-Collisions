### Safety analysis for timestep 0.9 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

**Assumptions and Clarifications:**

* The prompt mentions "adjusted distances" (adjusted_d_long and adjusted_d_lat), but these values are not provided in the scenario context. Therefore, the analysis will be conducted using the given "real distance" (DTClong and DTClat) values.
*  TTC will be approximated based on the provided distance and velocity data.  A more precise calculation would require constant acceleration assumptions or more detailed trajectory information.
* No ego vehicle dimensions are provided, thus MDC is approximated as the minimum of DTClong and DTClat at the last timestep.  A true MDC calculation requires vehicle geometry.

### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID:** 30676
- Distance Risk reason: Located 20.23m longitudinally and laterally in the front-left. No immediate distance risk.

- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- **Obstacle ID:** 30683
- Distance Risk reason:  Located -10.66m longitudinally and laterally in the rear-left, indicating it's moving away. 
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Moving away longitudinally at -15.68 m/s. Moving away laterally at 2.32 m/s. No time-based risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- **Obstacle ID:** 30686
- Distance Risk reason: Located 18.19m longitudinally and laterally in the front-right. No immediate distance risk.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Approaching longitudinally at -3.34 m/s. No lateral relative velocity.  TTC is relatively high, presenting low risk.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- **Obstacle ID:** 30687
- Distance Risk reason: Located 14.17m longitudinally and laterally in the front-right.  No immediate distance risk.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Approaching longitudinally at -3.26 m/s and laterally at 0.13 m/s. TTC is moderate, representing a medium risk.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 4

- **Obstacle ID:** 30688
- Distance Risk reason: Located 9.90m longitudinally and laterally in the front-right.  Potential medium distance risk.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Approaching longitudinally at -3.02 m/s and laterally at 0.50 m/s. TTC is relatively low, posing a medium risk.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3

- **Obstacle ID:** 30690
- Distance Risk reason: Located 9.55m longitudinally and laterally in the front-right. Potential medium distance risk.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Approaching longitudinally at -1.17 m/s. Moving away laterally at -5.33 m/s, reducing lateral risk. Overall TTC is medium, representing a medium risk.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3

- **Obstacle ID:** 30693
- Distance Risk reason: Located -8.38m longitudinally and laterally behind the ego vehicle, suggesting it is moving away.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Approaching longitudinally (from behind) at 2.89 m/s while moving closer laterally at -0.99 m/s.  Although the lateral motion indicates some risk, the longitudinal movement suggests it's likely overtaking.  TTC is somewhat low, thus medium risk.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 4

- **Obstacle ID:** 30695
- Distance Risk reason: Located -21.00m longitudinally and laterally behind the ego vehicle, indicating it is moving away.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Approaching longitudinally at 2.07m/s while moving closer laterally at -2.71m/s. The lateral motion suggests risk, but the longitudinal movement and large distance mitigate immediate concern.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4


### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
    "CollisionObstacle": null,
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null,
    "IsCollisionScenario": false,
    "Justification": "No obstacle poses an immediate collision risk (Overall Risk Score of 0 or 1) in the last provided timestep (0.9 seconds).  Obstacle 30688 and 30690 pose the highest risk, with an Overall Risk Score of 3 (Medium Risk), warranting attention, but not constituting a collision scenario."
