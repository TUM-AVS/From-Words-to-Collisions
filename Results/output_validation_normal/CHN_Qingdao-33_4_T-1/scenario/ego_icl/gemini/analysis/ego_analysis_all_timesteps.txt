* **Obstacle 30676:** Front-left, moving towards ego longitudinally. No immediate risk due to large lateral and longitudinal distances.  No risk.

* **Obstacle 30683:** Rear-left, moving away from ego longitudinally.  Lateral distance is safe. No risk.

* **Obstacle 30686:** Front-right, moving towards ego longitudinally. Lateral distance safe. No immediate risk, but monitor. Low risk.

* **Obstacle 30687:** Front-right, moving towards ego longitudinally and slightly laterally.  Lateral distance safe. No immediate risk, but monitor. Low risk.

* **Obstacle 30688:** Front-right, moving towards ego longitudinally and slightly laterally. Lateral distance safe. No immediate risk, but monitor. Low risk.


* **Obstacle 30690:** Front-right, moving towards ego longitudinally, moving away laterally. Longitudinal distance is decreasing but not immediately concerning. Lateral distance also safe. Medium risk.

* **Obstacle 30693:** Behind, moving towards ego longitudinally. Lateral distance is 0 (aligned). Longitudinal distance is decreasing. Risk level depends on closing velocity. Medium risk.


* **Obstacle 30695:** Rear-left, moving towards ego longitudinally and laterally from behind. Lateral distance and longitudinal distance both safe. But keep monitoring. Low risk.

**Detailed Analysis for Obstacle 30690:**

This obstacle requires more careful consideration because the lateral distance is 0.00m (exact alignment) and the longitudinal distance is shrinking slightly. We have:

* **Longitudinal distance:** 9.55 m
* **Lateral distance:** -0.69 m
* **Longitudinal Relative Velocity:** -1.17 m/s (closing)
* **Lateral Relative Velocity:** -5.33 m/s (diverging, moving away)

**TTC Calculation:**

* **Longitudinal TTC:** 9.55m / 1.17 m/s ≈ 8.16s 

**MDC Calculation:** Although the lateral distance is 0, it is diverging to right. The immediate risk is minimal.

**Risk Assessment for Obstacle 30690:**

Based on TTC (8.16s) and diverging trajectory in the lateral direction, the risk is currently assessed as **medium**. However, continued monitoring is crucial.

**Detailed Analysis for Obstacle 30693:**
This obstacle is behind and aligned with the ego vehicle:
* **Longitudinal distance:** -8.38 m
* **Lateral distance:** 0.00 m
* **Longitudinal Relative Velocity:** 2.89 m/s (closing)
* **Lateral Relative Velocity:** -0.99 m/s (diverging)

**TTC Calculation:**
* **Longitudinal TTC:** 8.38 m / 2.89 m/s ≈ 2.90 s

**MDC Calculation:** Lateral distance is 0, but diverging.

**Risk Assessment for Obstacle 30693:**

Based on the converging longitudinal trajectory (TTC ≈ 2.90s), the risk is classified as **Medium (3)**. However, as the lateral distance is 0.00m, continuous monitoring is recommended.


**Collision Scenario Determination:**

No obstacle has a risk score of 0 (collision) or 1 (extreme risk). Therefore, this is NOT a collision scenario.

**JSON Summary:**

```json
{
  "CollisionObstacle": {},
  "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {},
  "IsCollisionScenario": false,
  "Justification": "No obstacle has a collision risk score of 0 or an extreme risk score of 1 with critically low TTC or MDC."
