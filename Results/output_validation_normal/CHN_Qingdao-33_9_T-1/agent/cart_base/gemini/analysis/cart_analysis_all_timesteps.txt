Obstacle 30684 is showing a concerning trajectory. It's in lanelet 262, which is likely adjacent to the ego vehicle's lanelet 261. Its velocity is consistently high (around 12-13 m/s) and increasing, while the ego vehicle is decelerating.  The x-coordinates are converging, suggesting a possible lane change maneuver by 30684 or a potential side-swipe collision.  This needs close monitoring. Although no collision is imminent in the next timestep, the rapid approach and speed difference between the two warrant classifying this as a high risk.
