Here's a breakdown of the collision analysis at t=0.9s:

**Ego Vehicle State (t=0.9s):**
* Position: (429.1083, -2088.0013)
* Orientation: -1.06758 radians
* Velocity: 2.901 m/s
* Acceleration: -1.187 m/sÂ²

**Obstacles Analysis (t=0.9s):**

* **Obstacle 30676:**
    * Position: (433.3343, -2113.1662)
    * Stationary and far from the ego vehicle.
    * Risk Score: 5

* **Obstacle 30678:**
    * Position: (425.8605, -2113.8356)
    * Almost stationary and far from the ego vehicle.
    * Risk Score: 5

* **Obstacle 30680:**
    * Position: (418.3767, -2114.5059)
    * Almost stationary and far from the ego vehicle.
    * Risk Score: 5

* **Obstacle 30684:**
    * Position: (424.3414, -2072.0771)
    * This obstacle is moving with a high velocity (13.5632 m/s) and positive acceleration.  Crucially, its Y-coordinate is significantly less than the ego vehicle's, and it's approaching the ego vehicle's Y-coordinate rapidly. It poses the highest risk, although a collision is not guaranteed within a very short time frame based on the available data.
    * Risk Score: 2

* **Obstacle 30686:**
    * Position: (442.5965, -2101.1179)
    * This obstacle is moving slower than the ego vehicle, with a moderate velocity. Its trajectory appears to be diverging from the ego vehicle.
    * Risk Score: 4


* **Obstacle 30687:**
    * Position: (452.6584, -2102.4532)
    * This obstacle, although far at present, has consistently moved closer in Y, indicating a possible risk. However, the provided information may be insufficient for definite determination, therefore additional caution should be taken.
    * Risk Score: 4

* **Obstacle 30691:**
    * Position: (433.4469, -2102.7489)
    * Although its X coordinate is close to the ego vehicle, its Y coordinate, while still not at a great distance, suggests some safety. The near-zero acceleration may mean reduced risk with timely reaction.
    * Risk Score: 3

**Summary:**

Obstacle 30684 presents the most significant risk due to its high velocity, closing Y-coordinate, and the ego vehicle's deceleration. Further analysis with a shorter time interval would help precisely determine the risk.  At this time, no obstacles pose an immediate collision risk (score 0) or extreme risk (score 1).
