At t=0.9s, the ego vehicle is at (429.1083, -2088.0013) with a velocity of 2.901 m/s and decelerating at -1.187 m/sÂ². Let's analyze the risk posed by each obstacle:

* **Obstacle 30676:** Stationary and far away laterally. Negligible risk.
* **Obstacle 30678:** Almost stationary and far away laterally. Negligible risk.
* **Obstacle 30680:** Almost stationary and far away laterally. Negligible risk.
* **Obstacle 30684:**  Moving in the adjacent lane (262) and moving faster than ego.  The lateral distance is significant, and the trajectories appear to diverge. Low risk.
* **Obstacle 30686:** The lateral distance is large and the obstacle is moving away from the ego vehicle. Negligible risk.
* **Obstacle 30687:**  Located behind and to the right of the ego vehicle. While the lateral distance is somewhat close, the obstacle's trajectory and ego's deceleration suggest divergence.  Medium risk.
* **Obstacle 30691:** Located ahead of the ego vehicle and in a different lanelet, but the lateral distance is relatively small.  Requires further analysis.  Assuming straight-line motion for both ego and obstacle, a rough TTC calculation is not possible due to divergent lateral trajectories. Further information about lanelet geometry is needed to accurately assess risk. For now, we categorize this as a Medium Risk.
