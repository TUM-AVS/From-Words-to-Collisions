At time 0.9 seconds, Obstacle 30691 shows the highest risk. It is only 10.5 meters in front of the ego vehicle and moving longitudinally and laterally toward the ego vehicle with -0.99 m/s and -8.20 m/s, respectively. However, given the short time horizon of 1 second and the distance of almost all the mentioned obstacles, it is difficult to definitively categorize any obstacle as "Extreme Risk".  A longer time horizon is needed to make a more accurate assessment for all obstacles, as their trajectories and velocities could change significantly. Obstacle 30686 is also relatively close at 13.49m longitudinally and moving towards the ego vehicle but poses less risk due to a larger lateral distance of 3.88m and lower relative longitudinal speed. All other obstacles are further away longitudinally. Therefore, Obstacle 30691 is the highest risk obstacle in this timeframe but not yet clearly an "Extreme Risk".
