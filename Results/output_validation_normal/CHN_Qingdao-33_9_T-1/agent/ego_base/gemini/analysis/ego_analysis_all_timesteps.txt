At t=0.9s, Obstacle 30691 is closest to the ego vehicle longitudinally (10.5m) and moving towards the ego car longitudinally (-0.99 m/s).  It is also moving away laterally to the right at -8.20 m/s. While the longitudinal distance is moderately close, the longitudinal velocity suggests it's not an immediate collision risk. Other obstacles are further away longitudinally.  No obstacle poses an immediate collision risk. Therefore, no obstacles are classified as Collision, Extreme Risk, or High Risk.
