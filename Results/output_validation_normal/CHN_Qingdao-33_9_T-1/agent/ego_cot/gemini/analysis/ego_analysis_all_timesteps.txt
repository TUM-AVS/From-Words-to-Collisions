### Safety analysis for timestep 0.9s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

**Assumptions and Clarifications:**

* Since adjusted distances (adjusted_d_long, adjusted_d_lat) are not provided in the scenario, the provided real distances (DTClong, DTClat) will be used for this analysis.  This is not ideal and a proper analysis requires the adjusted distances.
* TTC will be estimated based on the provided velocities and distances.  Negative TTC values indicate the obstacle is moving away from the ego vehicle. If relative velocity is zero or close to zero while the obstacle is still driving toward the ego vehicle, TTC can not be calculated, it will be assumed as a large value and the risk will be set to 5.
*  An overall risk score is determined by considering both distance and TTC, with the lower score taking precedence (higher risk).
