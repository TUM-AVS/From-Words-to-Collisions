Obstacle 30676: Located front-right, consistently moving closer to the ego vehicle longitudinally while maintaining a lateral distance of approximately -6.82m. At the last timestep, the longitudinal distance is 19.58m with a closing velocity of -2.90 m/s.  TTC is 19.58/2.90 = 6.75s. MDC is estimated as >5m considering the stable lateral separation. Risk level: 4 (Low).

Obstacle 30678: Located front-right, consistently moving closer to the ego vehicle both longitudinally and laterally. At the last timestep, longitudinal distance is 16.56m with closing velocity of -2.90 m/s, and lateral distance is -13.69 with a closing velocity assumed to be near zero based on motion description. TTC longitudinally is 16.56/2.90 = 5.71s. MDC is conservatively estimated as >5m due to the relatively stable lateral separation, even though closing. Risk level: 4 (Low).

Obstacle 30680: Located front-right and moving slightly closer longitudinally and laterally.  At the last timestep, longitudinal distance is 13.54m with -2.90 m/s closing velocity, and lateral distance is -20.57m. TTC is 13.54/2.90 = 4.67s. MDC is >5m due to the large and rather stable lateral distance. Risk level: 4 (Low).

Obstacle 30684: Located rear-left, moving further away from the ego vehicle longitudinally at high speed. Lateral distance remains fairly constant around 1.89m. At the last timestep, the longitudinal distance is -11.74m (behind the ego vehicle) and receding rapidly,  lateral distance is 1.89m. TTC is not applicable due to diverging trajectory. MDC is >5m. Risk level: 5 (Negligible).

Obstacle 30686: Located front-left. Consistently approaching ego vehicle both longitudinally and laterally. At the last timestep, longitudinal distance is 13.49m, lateral distance is 3.88m. Longitudinal velocity is -7.41 m/s, lateral velocity is -2.69 m/s. Longitudinal TTC is 13.49/7.41 = 1.82s. Lateral TTC is 3.88 / 2.69 = 1.44s. MDC is <5m. Risk level: 3 (Medium), due to the lower TTC of 1.44s and closing in both dimensions.

Obstacle 30687: Located front-left. Approaching in both directions. At the last timestep, longitudinal distance is 19.51m, lateral distance is 12.05m, longitudinal velocity is -4.65 m/s, lateral velocity is -3.99 m/s. Longitudinal TTC: 19.51/4.65 = 4.19s. Lateral TTC is 12.05/3.99 = 3.02s. MDC is >5m, considering that both lateral and longitudinal TTC suggest no immediate danger. Risk level: 4 (Low Risk)

Obstacle 30691: Located front-right. Moving away longitudinally initially, then slightly approaching at the last timestep with longitudinal distance 10.50m and velocity of -0.99 m/s, and increasing lateral separation (now at -1.70m and moving away at -8.20 m/s). Longitudinal TTC: 10.50/0.99 = 10.6s.  Lateral TTC is not applicable due to diverging paths. MDC is >5m. Risk level: 5 (Negligible), the lateral divergence dominates despite the slight closing longitudinally.
