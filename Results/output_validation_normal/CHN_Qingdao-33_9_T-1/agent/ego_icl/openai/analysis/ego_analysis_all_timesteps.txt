To analyze the risk of collision between the ego vehicle and the obstacles in the most recent timestep (0.9 seconds), we need to evaluate their proximity, trajectory, and the likelihood of collision using the adjusted distances. The data provided indicate their positions relative to the ego vehicle, their velocities, and accelerations.

Here's the step-by-step analysis of each obstacle:

### Obstacle-by-Obstacle Analysis

**Obstacle 30676 (Front-right):**
- **Adjusted Distances**: Longitudinal = 19.58m, Lateral = -6.82m
- **Relative Velocities**: Longitudinal = -2.90 m/s (approaching), Lateral = 0.00 m/s (no motion)
- **TTC (Longitudinal)**: \( \text{TTC} = \frac{19.58}{| -2.90 |} = 6.75 \) seconds
- **MDC**: This obstacle is primarily in front-right, so focus on longitudinal distance, which is greater than 5m. The relative velocity suggests it's approaching but not fast enough to be a concern now.
- **Risk Assessment**: Low risk (4) due to slow approach and sufficient distance.

**Obstacle 30678 (Front-right):**
- **Adjusted Distances**: Longitudinal = 16.56m, Lateral = -13.69m
- **Relative Velocities**: Longitudinal = -2.90 m/s, Lateral = 0.00 m/s
- **TTC (Longitudinal)**: \( \text{TTC} = \frac{16.56}{| -2.90 |} = 5.71 \) seconds
- **MDC**: Adequate longitudinal distance, suggests no immediate threat. The lateral approach from history suggests caution, but current projection is stable.
- **Risk Assessment**: Low risk (4) as it's safely in advance.

**Obstacle 30680 (Front-right):**
- **Adjusted Distances**: Longitudinal = 13.54m, Lateral = -20.57m
- **Relative Velocities**: Longitudinal = -2.90 m/s, Lateral = 0.01 m/s
- **TTC (Longitudinal)**: \( \text{TTC} = \frac{13.54}{| -2.90 |} = 4.67 \) seconds
- **MDC**: Similarly placed as other front-right obstacles, considerably farther laterally; long longitudinal distance avoids drastic measures.
- **Risk Assessment**: Medium risk (3) due to approach trajectory adjustments needed.

**Obstacle 30684 (Rear-left):**
- **Adjusted Distances**: Longitudinal = -11.74m, Lateral = 1.89m
- **Relative Velocities**: Longitudinal = -16.46 m/s, Lateral = 0.01 m/s
- **TTC (Longitudinal)**: Moving away, not a collision scenario.
- **MDC**: Moving away, implies no crossing path. Adequate separation longitudinally.
- **Risk Assessment**: No risk (5).

**Obstacle 30686 (Front-left):**
- **Adjusted Distances**: Longitudinal = 13.49m, Lateral = 3.88m
- **Relative Velocities**: Longitudinal = -7.41 m/s, Lateral = -2.69 m/s
- **TTC (Longitudinal)**: \( \text{TTC} = \frac{13.49}{| -7.41 |} = 1.82 \) seconds
- **TTC (Lateral)**: Given it's coming from the left with relative approach velocity, lateral should be considered separately.
- **MDC**: Longitudinal approach sooner than lateral threatens.
- **Risk Assessment**: Medium risk (3) due to the combined approach from both dimensions.

**Obstacle 30687 (Front-left):**
- **Adjusted Distances**: Longitudinal = 19.51m, Lateral = 12.05m
- **Relative Velocities**: Longitudinal = -4.65 m/s, Lateral = -3.99 m/s
- **TTC (Longitudinal)**: \( \text{TTC} = \frac{19.51}{| -4.65 |} = 4.19 \) seconds
- **MDC**: Distance and approach speed suggest adequate time for maneuvering.
- **Risk Assessment**: Low risk (4) given the slower approach rate and greater starting separation.

**Obstacle 30691 (Front-right):**
- **Adjusted Distances**: Longitudinal = 10.50m, Lateral = -1.70m
- **Relative Velocities**: Longitudinal = -0.99 m/s, Lateral = -8.20 m/s
- **TTC (Longitudinal)**: \( \text{TTC} = \frac{10.50}{| -0.99 |} = 10.61 \) seconds
- **TTC (Lateral)**: \( \text{TTC} = \frac{1.70}{| -8.20 |} \approx 0.21 \) seconds
- **MDC**: Combination of low TTC in lateral direction and insufficient closing in longitudinal direction.
- **Risk Assessment**: High risk (2) due to minimal lateral clearance and rapid approach.

### Conclusion
The obstacle with the highest risk score based on the motion and TTC is Obstacle 30691 due to its low lateral TTC, marking it as high risk. Other obstacles have been considered low-to-medium risk applying safe space assumptions and given velocities.
