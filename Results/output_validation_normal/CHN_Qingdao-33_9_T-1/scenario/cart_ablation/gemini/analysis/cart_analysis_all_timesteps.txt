At t=0.9s, the ego vehicle at (429.1083, -2088.0013) is located in lanelet 261.  Obstacle 30684 is at (424.3414, -2072.0771) in lanelet 262. While obstacle 30684 is relatively close and moving quickly (13.5632 m/s), it's in a neighboring lane (262) and its y-coordinate indicates it is ahead of the ego vehicle.  Given the ego vehicle's deceleration, a collision in the next few timesteps appears unlikely.  No other obstacles present an immediate collision risk.
