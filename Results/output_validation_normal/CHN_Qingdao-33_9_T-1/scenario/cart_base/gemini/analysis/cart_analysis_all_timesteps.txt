At t=0.9s, Ego is in lanelet 261.0 at (429.1083, -2088.0013) with a velocity of 2.901 m/s and decelerating.  Let's analyze the obstacles:

* **Obstacle 30676.0:** Stationary and far from Ego. Negligible risk.
* **Obstacle 30678.0:** Almost stationary and far from Ego. Negligible risk.
* **Obstacle 30680.0:** Almost stationary and far from Ego. Negligible risk.
* **Obstacle 30684.0:** In lanelet 262.0 at (424.3414, -2072.0771) with a velocity of 13.5632 m/s and accelerating. This obstacle is spatially close to the ego vehicle, but it appears to be moving away and is in a different, adjacent lanelet. This obstacle may pose a medium risk if the ego were to make an unsignalled lane change but currently does not pose an immediate threat.  Medium risk.
* **Obstacle 30686.0:**  In lanelet 1032.0 at (442.5965, -2101.1179), moving at 5.2539 m/s.  This obstacle is relatively far and doesn't pose an immediate threat. Low risk.
* **Obstacle 30687.0:** Located in lanelet 296.0 at (452.6584, -2102.4532), moving at 4.3598 m/s.  This obstacle is further away than 30686 and also doesn't present an immediate risk. Low risk.
* **Obstacle 30691.0:** Located in lanelet 992.0 at (433.4469, -2102.7489), moving at 8.4183 m/s. While the absolute distance isn't extremely close, the y-coordinate suggests a possible lane change by this obstacle toward the ego vehicle's path or the path of 30684, potentially creating a risky situation in the near future given the higher speed. Medium Risk
