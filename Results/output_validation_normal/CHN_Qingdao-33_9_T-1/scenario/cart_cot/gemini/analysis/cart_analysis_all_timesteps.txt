### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 30676.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is far from the ego vehicle and stationary.  History shows no movement. No imminent risk.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Obstacle is stationary, posing no immediate time-based risk. History confirms this.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5
- Obstacle ID: 30678.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is laterally separated from the ego vehicle and almost stationary. History indicates minimal lateral movement.  No imminent risk.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Obstacle is almost stationary, thus posing no time-based risk. History supports this.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5
- Obstacle ID: 30680.0
- Distance Risk reason:  Obstacle is laterally separated and far from the ego vehicle. History shows minimal movement. No imminent risk.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason:  Obstacle has very low velocity and poses no immediate time-based risk given its trajectory history and current location.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5
- Obstacle ID: 30684.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is in a different lanelet, but its X position is converging towards the ego vehicle's predicted path.  History shows obstacle approaching ego vehicle. Moderate risk.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason:  Obstacle has high velocity in the same general direction as ego vehicle, but in a different lanelet, therefore the TTC is likely higher, and hence less risky. History suggests it is likely to remain in a different lane, reducing time-related risk.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4
- Obstacle ID: 30686.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is relatively far from the ego vehicle.  History shows its trajectory is diverging from the ego vehicle.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: The obstacle's velocity and acceleration history pose no immediate threat given the divergence in trajectories observed over previous timesteps.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4
- Obstacle ID: 30687.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is far from the ego vehicle and moving in a diverging orientation from Ego. Historical trajectory shows minimal lateral separation, but a diverging path.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Obstacle's velocity and trajectory history indicate no immediate time-related risk.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4
- Obstacle ID: 30691.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is in a different lanelet. History shows that it's maintaining a lateral distance from the ego vehicle while moving in a similar longitudinal direction. Low risk.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Obstacle is moving with similar longitudinal velocity as ego vehicle but maintaining lateral separation based on history. Therefore, TTC is likely high and poses low risk.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. **Most critical obstacles:** Obstacle 30684.0 requires the most attention as it is closest to the ego vehicle longitudinally, although in a different lane.

2. **Trajectory analysis:** Over the 10 timesteps, Obstacle 30684.0 moves faster than the ego vehicle. Other obstacles maintain a safe distance or are moving away.

3. **Relative positions, velocities, and accelerations:** Obstacle 30684.0 has a higher velocity than the ego vehicle. All other obstacles are moving slowly, stationary, or diverging.

4. **Collision determination:** No collision has occurred or seems imminent in the next few timesteps based on the current trajectories. 

5. **Reasoning:** Though Obstacle 30684.0 is closer, it's in a different lane and the analysis of its motion history does not suggest a collision risk in the immediate future. It does require monitoring, though. All other obstacles maintain a safe distance, are stationary, or are moving in diverging directions based on the provided trajectory history.
