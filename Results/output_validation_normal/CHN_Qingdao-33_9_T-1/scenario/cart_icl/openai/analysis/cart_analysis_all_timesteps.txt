### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
The evaluation indicates that no obstacles are in a collision course relative to the ego vehicle. While obstacles move in various trajectories, the quantitative distance and velocity metrics consistently score high on safety, indicating negligible to low risk. As such, there's no factor within the monitored timesteps that suggests the possibility of an impact.
