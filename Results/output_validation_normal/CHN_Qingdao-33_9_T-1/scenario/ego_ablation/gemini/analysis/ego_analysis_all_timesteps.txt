Obstacle 30686 shows the highest risk at the most recent timestep (0.9 seconds).  It's located front-left, with a longitudinal distance of 13.49m and closing at -7.41 m/s. The lateral distance is only 3.88m and also closing at -2.69 m/s.  While not an immediate collision, the combined closing rates in both longitudinal and lateral directions suggest a high probability of collision if evasive action isn't taken.

Obstacle 30680 (Front-right, 13.54m longitudinal, -20.57m lateral) and Obstacles 30676 and 30678 (also Front-right) present a less severe risk, with longitudinal closing velocities but substantial lateral separation. However, their lateral distances are decreasing but not enough to post immediate collision.  Obstacle 30691 (Front-right), while laterally close, is moving away longitudinally.  Obstacle 30687 (Front-left) maintains a safe longitudinal distance at this timestep.

Obstacle 30684 (Rear-left) is moving away and poses no risk.

    "IsCollisionScenario": false,
    "Reasoning": "Obstacle 30686 poses an extreme risk with high closing velocities both longitudinally and laterally at 0.9 seconds, making a collision highly likely if no evasive action is taken. Other obstacles present lower risks due to greater lateral distances or separating longitudinal velocities at this specific timestep."
