Obstacle 30691 is moving away longitudinally (10.5m away) but moving laterally towards the ego vehicle, with a lateral velocity of -8.20 m/s. Although it currently poses no immediate collision risk, its rapid lateral movement and proximity require close monitoring. It's classified as High Risk due to the potential for a future collision if the lateral movement continues.

Obstacle 30686 is approaching the ego vehicle both longitudinally (13.49 m) and laterally, with velocities of -7.41 m/s and -2.69 m/s, respectively.  This poses a high risk, necessitating prompt attention and possibly evasive maneuvers.

Obstacle 30687 is approaching longitudinally (19.51 m) and laterally (12.05 m) with respective velocities of -4.65 m/s and -3.99 m/s.  It's a potential concern, but the larger longitudinal distance compared to 30686 makes it a Medium Risk.

Other obstacles (30676, 30678, and 30680) are moving towards the ego vehicle longitudinally, but they are located further laterally, making them lower risk currently. Obstacle 30684 is moving away longitudinally and poses no immediate threat.
