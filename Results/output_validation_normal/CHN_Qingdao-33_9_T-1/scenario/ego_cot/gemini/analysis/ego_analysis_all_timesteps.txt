### Safety analysis for timestep 0.9 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

It's crucial to note that the provided scenario description lacks adjusted distances (adjusted_d_long and adjusted_d_lat).  This makes accurate TTC and MDC calculations impossible.  My analysis will therefore focus on qualitative risk assessment based on the available information, primarily relative velocities and distances.

**Assumptions:** Since adjusted distances aren't available, I'll assume a vehicle size of approximately 4m long and 2m wide for a rough estimation of collision boundaries. I will also interpret "driving toward" as having a negative relative velocity (implying closing distance) and "moving away" as positive relative velocity.

### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 30676**
- Distance Risk reason: Located Front-right at 19.58m longitudinal and lateral.  Relatively far, but still requires monitoring given the closing longitudinal velocity.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason:  Without adjusted distances and ego vehicle's velocity, TTC cannot be precisely calculated. However, a slow closing longitudinal velocity suggests some time to react.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3

- **Obstacle ID: 30678**
- Distance Risk reason: Front-right, closer than 30676 at 16.56m longitudinally and laterally, with closing longitudinal velocity.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: Similar to 30676, TTC calculation is impossible. However, proximity and closing speed raise concern.
- Time safety score: 2
- Overall Risk score: 2

- **Obstacle ID: 30680**
- Distance Risk reason: Front-right and closest of the three on the right at 13.54m longitudinally and laterally. Longitudinal velocity is closing.
- Distance safety score: 2
- Time Risk reason:  Proximity and closing velocity increase risk significantly. Requires immediate attention.
- Time safety score: 2
- Overall Risk score: 2

- **Obstacle ID: 30684**
- Distance Risk reason: Rear-left and moving away longitudinally (-11.74m).  While moving away laterally, the small rate requires further evaluation with adjusted distances.
- Distance safety score: 4 
- Time Risk reason: Moving away longitudinally significantly reduces risk. Lateral movement needs assessment.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 30686**
- Distance Risk reason: Front-left, 13.49m both longitudinally and laterally.  Closing velocity in both directions suggests elevated risk.
- Distance safety score: 2
- Time Risk reason: Without adjusted distances, true risk is difficult to estimate. The closing velocity raises concern.
- Time safety score: 2
- Overall Risk score: 2

- **Obstacle ID: 30687**
- Distance Risk reason: Front-left, further away than 30686 at 19.51m but still exhibits closing velocity in both directions.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: Closing velocities warrant observation, precise TTC calculation required.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3

- **Obstacle ID: 30691**
- Distance Risk reason: Front-right at 10.5m, exhibiting a small closing longitudinal velocity and significant lateral movement away. 
- Distance safety score: 2
- Time Risk reason: Complicated scenario. While laterally moving away quickly, longitudinal closing must be closely monitored.
- Time safety score: 2
- Overall Risk score: 2



### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
  "CollisionObstacle": null,
  "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null,
  "IsCollisionScenario": false,
  "Justification": "While several obstacles present medium risk (score 2) due to proximity and closing velocities, none indicate imminent collision at the current timestep.  Lack of adjusted distances prevents accurate collision prediction. Further observation and accurate TTC calculation are crucial for definitive collision assessment."
