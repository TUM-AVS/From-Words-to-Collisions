Let me analyze each obstacle at the most recent timestep (0.9 seconds) and assess collision risks:

1. **Obstacle 30676 (Front-right)**
   - Adjusted distances: longitudinal 19.58m, lateral -6.82m
   - Relative velocity: longitudinal -2.90 m/s (approaching), lateral 0.00 m/s
   - Motion: Driving toward longitudinally, no lateral motion
   - MDC: 6.82m (lateral distance)
   - TTC: 19.58/2.90 = 6.75s (longitudinal)
   - Risk: 5 (No Risk)

2. **Obstacle 30678 (Front-right)**
   - Adjusted distances: longitudinal 16.56m, lateral -13.69m
   - Relative velocity: longitudinal -2.90 m/s, lateral 0.00 m/s
   - Motion: Driving toward longitudinally, no lateral motion
   - MDC: 13.69m
   - TTC: 16.56/2.90 = 5.71s
   - Risk: 5 (No Risk)

3. **Obstacle 30680 (Front-right)**
   - Adjusted distances: longitudinal 13.54m, lateral -20.57m
   - Relative velocity: longitudinal -2.90 m/s, lateral 0.01 m/s
   - Motion: Driving toward longitudinally and laterally
   - MDC: 20.57m
   - TTC: 13.54/2.90 = 4.67s (longitudinal)
   - Risk: 5 (No Risk)

4. **Obstacle 30684 (Rear-left)**
   - Adjusted distances: longitudinal -11.74m, lateral 1.89m
   - Relative velocity: longitudinal -16.46 m/s (moving away), lateral 0.01 m/s
   - Motion: Moving away longitudinally and laterally
   - MDC: 1.89m
   - TTC: N/A (moving away)
   - Risk: 4 (Low Risk due to lateral distance)

5. **Obstacle 30686 (Front-left)**
   - Adjusted distances: longitudinal 13.49m, lateral 3.88m
   - Relative velocity: longitudinal -7.41 m/s, lateral -2.69 m/s
   - Motion: Driving toward both longitudinally and laterally
   - MDC: min(13.49, 3.88) = 3.88m
   - TTC: 3.88/2.69 = 1.44s (lateral)
   - Risk: 3 (Medium Risk)

6. **Obstacle 30687 (Front-left)**
   - Adjusted distances: longitudinal 19.51m, lateral 12.05m
   - Relative velocity: longitudinal -4.65 m/s, lateral -3.99 m/s
   - Motion: Driving toward both longitudinally and laterally
   - MDC: min(19.51, 12.05) = 12.05m
   - TTC: 12.05/3.99 = 3.02s (lateral)
   - Risk: 3 (Medium Risk)

7. **Obstacle 30691 (Front-right)**
   - Adjusted distances: longitudinal 10.50m, lateral -1.70m
   - Relative velocity: longitudinal -0.99 m/s, lateral -8.20 m/s
   - Motion: Driving toward longitudinally, moving away laterally
   - MDC: 1.70m
   - TTC: 10.50/0.99 = 10.61s (longitudinal)
   - Risk: 4 (Low Risk)

**Trajectory Analysis:**
- No obstacles show rapidly decreasing distances that would indicate imminent collision
- Obstacle 30686 has the highest risk (Medium Risk 3) but still with >1m distance
- All TTC values are above 1 second
- No actual collisions (distance â‰ˆ 0m) occurring

**Conclusion:**
This is NOT a collision scenario as no obstacles have risk scores of 0 or 1. The closest risk is Obstacle 30686 with Medium Risk (score 3).
