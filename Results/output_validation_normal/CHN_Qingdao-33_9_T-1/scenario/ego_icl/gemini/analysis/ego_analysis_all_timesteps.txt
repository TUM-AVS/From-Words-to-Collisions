* **Obstacle 30676:** In the front-right, moving towards the ego vehicle longitudinally.  Lateral distance is stable around -6.82m. Longitudinal distance decreasing from 23.87m to 19.58m.  This indicates a low lateral risk, but a potential longitudinal risk if the trend continues.

* **Obstacle 30678:**  Similar trajectory to 30676 but further out laterally (around -13.69m). Longitudinal distance decreasing from 20.85m to 16.56m. Lateral motion is negligible despite the description. This presents a low risk currently.

* **Obstacle 30680:**  Furthest out laterally (around -20.57m) and longitudinally decreasing from 15.23m (at t=0.5s) to 13.54m. Still low risk, but trajectory should be monitored.

* **Obstacle 30684:** To the rear-left, rapidly moving away longitudinally (from 1.88m to -11.74m). Lateral distance remains stable.  No collision risk, moving away from ego.

* **Obstacle 30686:** In the front-left, approaching the ego vehicle both longitudinally and laterally. Longitudinal distance decreasing from 20.55m to 13.49m, and lateral distance from 6.11m to 3.88m. This obstacle poses a higher risk.

* **Obstacle 30687:** Also front-left, but further out longitudinally than 30686 (decreasing from 21.16m at t=0.6 to 19.51m). Lateral distance is also larger, decreasing from 13.21m to 12.05m.  Medium to low risk currently.

* **Obstacle 30691:** Initially in front and moving away longitudinally, but by t=0.9s, is moving towards the ego longitudinally (10.50m) and significantly away laterally (-1.70m). The lateral movement suggests it's changing lanes.

**Detailed Risk Calculation (for obstacle 30686 at t=0.9s):**

* **Longitudinal TTC:** 13.49m / 7.41m/s ≈ 1.82s (Medium Risk)
* **Lateral TTC:** 3.88m / 2.69m/s ≈ 1.44s (Medium Risk)

* **MDC:**  Since this is a diagonal approach, we consider the smaller of the two TTC values (lateral) and approximate the MDC by multiplying the lateral relative velocity with this TTC.  Therefore, MDC ≈ 1.44s * 2.69 ≈ 3.87m (Low Risk).

**Overall Assessment:**

Obstacle 30686 poses the highest risk with medium risk scores for both longitudinal and lateral TTC.  While the MDC suggests a low risk, the converging trajectory and decreasing distances warrant closer monitoring. This is NOT a collision scenario yet, but it could quickly escalate if trajectories are maintained.  No obstacle meets the collision (risk score 0) or extreme risk (risk score 1) criteria at the most recent timestep.
