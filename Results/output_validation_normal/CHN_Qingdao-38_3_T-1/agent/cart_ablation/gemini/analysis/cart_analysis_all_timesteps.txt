Here's the analysis and the JSON output:

**Analysis:**

The ego vehicle (ID 30668) is consistently braking and decelerating throughout the provided timesteps. We need to analyze the trajectories of the other vehicles relative to the ego vehicle to assess collision risks.

* **Obstacle 30666:** This obstacle is located in lanelet 499, which seems to be separate from the ego vehicle's lanelet (502). While the obstacle is moving with a higher velocity than the ego vehicle and accelerating slightly, its y-coordinate (-1690 to -1697) is always significantly different from the ego vehicle's y-coordinate (-1672), indicating they are not on a collision course in the near future.  

* **Obstacle 30667:** This obstacle is initially located in lanelet 1230 and then transitions to lanelets 1228 and back to 1230.  The y-coordinate of this obstacle changes from -1671 to -1666 throughout the scenario, getting closer to the ego vehicle's y-coordinate, which remains around -1672. The x-coordinate of this obstacle also decreases, moving from -126 to -121, while the x-coordinate of the ego decreases from -142 to -135, making the two vehicles move closer in the x direction as well. This suggests a potential risk, warranting further observation.  This obstacle may pose a High or even Extreme risk in the near future, although based on the limited data here, we cannot definitively say.  The closing distance suggests this as the most likely high-risk candidate.

* **Obstacle 30669:** This obstacle is in lanelet 496.  Similar to obstacle 30666, its y-coordinate (-1654 to -1660) is significantly different from the ego vehicle's y-coordinate, suggesting no immediate risk. This obstacle is also decelerating.

* **Obstacle 30670:** This obstacle is in lanelet 498. Like obstacles 30666 and 30669, its y-coordinate (-1690 to -1683) is significantly different from the ego vehicle's, suggesting no immediate risk.


Based on the 0.9-second timeframe, no collision is imminent, and no obstacle poses an *extreme* risk (risk score 1) according to the provided criteria. Obstacle 30667 is the most likely candidate for a higher risk level due to the vehicles closing in on each other, and warrants attention.  With the limited data, it's classified as High Risk (2).
