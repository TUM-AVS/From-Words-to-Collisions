The ego vehicle is braking and decelerating significantly throughout the provided timeframe.  Let's analyze the obstacles:

* **Obstacle 30666:** This obstacle is moving relatively fast and accelerating in lane 499. While its y-coordinate (-1690 to -1697) places it behind the ego vehicle initially, it's in a different lane and the provided data doesn't offer enough information on lane geometry and relative headings to definitively assess the risk.  It bears watching in subsequent timesteps.

* **Obstacle 30667:** This obstacle is in lane 1230 initially and moves to lane 1228.  Its y-coordinate (-1671 to -1666) suggests it's roughly parallel to the ego vehicle, perhaps in an adjacent lane.  Again, without lane geometry information, a definitive risk assessment is difficult.

* **Obstacle 30669:** This obstacle is decelerating rapidly in lane 496.  Its y-coordinate (-1654 to -1660) suggests it's ahead of the ego vehicle.  No immediate collision risk is apparent.

* **Obstacle 30670:**  This obstacle is in lane 498 and its behavior is inconsistent (fluctuations in acceleration). Its y-coordinate (-1690 to -1683) suggests it starts behind the ego vehicle but moves closer over time.  Similar to obstacle 30666, it warrants further observation but doesn't present an immediate risk.


Given the lack of precise lane geometry and inter-lane distances, a conclusive risk assessment is challenging. No collisions are observed, and no immediate collisions seem highly likely based on the provided data, but further information is needed to accurately assess obstacles 30666, 30667, and 30670.
