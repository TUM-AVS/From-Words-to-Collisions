At t=0.9s, the ego vehicle is at (-135.8546, -1672.5688) with a velocity of 4.24 and decelerating at -2.2334.  Let's analyze the risk posed by each obstacle at this timestep, considering their trajectories from previous timesteps:

* **Obstacle 30667:** This obstacle is at (-121.3982, -1666.9124) and moving with a velocity of 8.6469.  Its lateral position (-1666.9124) is significantly different from the ego's (-1672.5688), suggesting a low lateral collision risk.  Longitudinally, the obstacle is ahead of the ego, and the difference in their velocities indicates a decreasing distance. However, given the separation and the rate of deceleration of the ego, a collision is unlikely in the immediate future.

* **Obstacle 30669:** Located at (-123.6591, -1654.6498) with velocity 9.2915 at 0.1sec. Given the ego's lanelet (502) and Obstacle 30669's lanelet (496), they are likely on different, non-intersecting paths. This suggests a negligible risk of collision, even with Obstacle 30669's proximity and speed.

* **Obstacle 30670:** This obstacle is at (-119.482, -1683.4077), which is slightly behind the ego. Obstacle 30670's trajectory indicates relatively stable movement. The lateral separation suggests a low risk of collision.

Based on the provided data, no obstacle presents an immediate collision risk. Although Obstacle 30667 is approaching the ego, the current separation and their respective velocities and decelerations suggest sufficient time and space for the ego to react and avoid a collision.
