At t=0.9s, the ego vehicle at (-135.85, -1672.57) continues decelerating at -2.23 m/sÂ².  Let's analyze the obstacles relative to the ego vehicle:

* **Obstacle 30667:** Positioned at (-121.40, -1666.91), this obstacle is ahead and slightly to the right of the ego vehicle and moving faster.  There's a lateral separation, lessening the risk.  Without precise velocity vectors, it's hard to calculate a precise TTC, but the risk appears low.

* **Obstacle 30669:** Located at (-123.66, -1660.34), this obstacle is ahead and to the right of the ego vehicle. The lateral separation suggests a low risk.  More information about the velocity vectors is needed for accurate TTC calculation.

* **Obstacle 30670:** This obstacle, at (-119.48, -1683.41), is behind and slightly to the left of the ego vehicle. The different lanelet suggests a low risk unless there's an unexpected lane change.


Given that we lack complete velocity vector information (only speeds are provided), and relying on the final provided timestep (0.9s), the overall risk assessment is as follows:


```json
{
  "CollisionObstacles": [],
  "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {},
  "HighRiskObstacle": {}
}
