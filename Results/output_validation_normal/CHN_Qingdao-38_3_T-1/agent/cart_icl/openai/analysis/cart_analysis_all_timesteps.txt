### Analysis:

**At 0.9 seconds:**

- **Ego Vehicle (30668.0):**  
  - Position: (-135.8546, -1672.5688), Orientation: 0.0559
  - Velocity: 4.24 m/s, Acceleration: -2.2334 m/s²
  - The ego is decelerating.

- **Obstacle 30666.0 [Not listed at 0.9s]:**  
  - Obstacle no longer present at the last timestamp, so there's no immediate concern for collision.

- **Obstacle 30667.0:**  
  - Position: (-121.3982, -1666.9124), Orientation: 1.0781
  - Velocity: 8.6469 m/s, Acceleration: 0.1555 m/s²
  - Distance from Ego: Approximately 14.47 meters (straight-line distance).
  - Trajectory indicates diverging path from the Ego vehicle.
  - **Risk Evaluation:** Low Risk (4)

- **Obstacle 30669.0:**  
  - Position: (-123.6591, -1660.3371), Orientation: -1.5286
  - Velocity: 6.2482 m/s, Acceleration: 0.1757 m/s²
  - Distance from Ego: Approximately 15.59 meters (straight-line distance).
  - Relative velocity and trajectory suggest no immediate collision course.
  - **Risk Evaluation:** Low Risk (4)

- **Obstacle 30670.0:**  
  - Position: (-119.482, -1683.4077), Orientation: 1.5632
  - Velocity: 8.5419 m/s, Acceleration: 0.2833 m/s²
  - Distance from Ego: Approximated at 19.21 meters (straight-line distance).
  - Position trend indicates diverging path from the Ego.
  - **Risk Evaluation:** Low Risk (4)

**Brief Explanation for Risk Scores:**

- All obstacles are either diverging or maintaining a safe path relative to the Ego. While speeds were generally faster for obstacles, increased distance and non-converging paths result in low risk as they are mostly in non-conflicting lanes.
