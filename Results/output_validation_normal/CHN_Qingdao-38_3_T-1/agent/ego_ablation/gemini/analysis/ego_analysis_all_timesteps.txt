At t=0.9s, obstacle 30669 is closest to the ego vehicle with a longitudinal distance of 8.35m and a lateral distance of 9.92 m. It shows a closing longitudinal velocity (-4.33 m/s) and lateral velocity (-6.25 m/s). Although the lateral distance suggests some margin, the continuous approach of this obstacle towards the ego vehicle longitudinally and laterally warrants attention and requires close monitoring.
Obstacle 30670 is at a longitudinal distance of 11.23m and lateral distance of -10.13m.  While the lateral movement poses minimal risk as it is moving away from the ego vehicle, the decreasing longitudinal distance at -3.70 m/s necessitates attention.
Obstacle 30667 is moving away from the ego vehicle both longitudinally and laterally (10.24m and 3.23m respectively), showing no immediate risk.
