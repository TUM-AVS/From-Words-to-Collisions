### Safety analysis for timestep 0.9 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

**Assumptions and Clarifications:**

* Since adjusted distances (adjusted_d_long, adjusted_d_lat) are not provided in the scenario context, I will use the provided real distances (DTClong, DTClat) for the analysis.  This is *not ideal* and a real system should always use adjusted distances. My analysis will therefore be less precise.
* I will assume a vehicle width and length of 2 meters for rough estimations where needed, although lacking adjusted distances significantly hampers accurate risk assessment.
* A simplified TTC calculation will be used: `TTC = Distance / Relative Velocity`.  This doesn't account for acceleration, making it less precise, but it's the best we can do without more information.
* I'm inferring MDC from the minimum distance observed across the provided timesteps and the current distance. This is an approximation.



### Obstacle Analysis:

**- Obstacle ID: 30667**
- Distance Risk reason:  Located 10.24m in front and 10.24m laterally to the left, and moving away both longitudinally and laterally.  Presents low risk based on distance.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason:  Moving away from the ego vehicle longitudinally, increasing TTC.  Lateral movement is away from ego. No immediate time-based risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 4


**- Obstacle ID: 30669**
- Distance Risk reason: Closest obstacle at 8.35m front and 8.35m left, moving closer. High risk based on proximity.
- Distance safety score: 2
- Time Risk reason:  Closing longitudinally and laterally. Based on simplified TTC calculation, assuming constant velocity, concerningly short time to collision.
- Time safety score: 2
- Overall Risk score: 2


**- Obstacle ID: 30670**
- Distance Risk reason: Situated 11.23m in front and 11.23 m to the right, moving closer longitudinally but its lateral velocity suggests movement towards ego vehicle. Poses a medium risk based on distance.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: Approaching longitudinally, but lateral movement could be problematic, needs monitoring.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3
