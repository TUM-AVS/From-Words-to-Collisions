Let me analyze each obstacle at the most recent timestep (0.9 seconds):

1. Obstacle 30667 (Front-left):
   - Adjusted distances: longitudinal 10.24m, lateral 3.23m
   - Relative velocities: longitudinal 0.27m/s (moving away), lateral 7.38m/s (moving away)
   - Motion: Moving away in both dimensions
   - MDC: Minimum distance is longitudinal 10.24m (no convergence)
   - TTC: Not applicable (moving away)
   - Risk: 5 (Negligible)

2. Obstacle 30669 (Front-left):
   - Adjusted distances: longitudinal 8.35m, lateral 9.92m
   - Relative velocities: longitudinal -4.33m/s (approaching), lateral -6.25m/s (approaching)
   - Motion: Approaching in both dimensions
   - MDC: Minimum distance is longitudinal 8.35m
   - TTC (longitudinal): 8.35/4.33 = 1.93s
   - TTC (lateral): 9.92/6.25 = 1.59s
   - Overall TTC: 1.59s (more critical dimension)
   - Risk: 3 (Medium Risk)

3. Obstacle 30670 (Front-right):
   - Adjusted distances: longitudinal 11.23m, lateral -10.13m
   - Relative velocities: longitudinal -3.70m/s (approaching), lateral 8.52m/s (approaching)
   - Motion: Approaching in both dimensions
   - MDC: Minimum distance is longitudinal 11.23m
   - TTC (longitudinal): 11.23/3.70 = 3.04s
   - TTC (lateral): 10.13/8.52 = 1.19s
   - Overall TTC: 1.19s (more critical dimension)
   - Risk: 2 (High Risk)

4. Obstacle 30666 (disappeared after 0.8s):
   - Not present in latest timestep
   - Risk: 5 (Negligible)

Trajectory Analysis:
- Obstacle 30669 shows consistent approach in both dimensions with decreasing distances
- Obstacle 30670 shows faster lateral approach than longitudinal
- No obstacles show collision or extreme risk conditions
