Let's analyze the most recent timestep (0.9 seconds) and use the trajectory data from previous timesteps to assess the collision risks for the identified obstacles.

### Obstacle Analysis

#### Obstacle 30667
- **Position**: Front-left
- **Adjusted Longitudinal Distance**: 10.24 m
- **Adjusted Lateral Distance**: 3.23 m
- **Relative Velocity (Longitudinal)**: 0.27 m/s (Moving away)
- **Relative Velocity (Lateral)**: 7.38 m/s (Moving left)
- **Trajectory Analysis**: This obstacle is consistently moving away both longitudinally and laterally. There is no approach towards the ego vehicle as both velocities are positive relative to the ego's direction.
- **MDC Calculation**: Given the positive velocities in both directions, the MDC is greater than 5.0 meters and increasing.
- **TTC Calculation**: Not applicable due to diverging paths.
- **Risk Level**: Negligible Risk (5)

#### Obstacle 30669
- **Position**: Front-left
- **Adjusted Longitudinal Distance**: 8.35 m
- **Adjusted Lateral Distance**: 9.92 m
- **Relative Velocity (Longitudinal)**: -4.33 m/s
- **Relative Velocity (Lateral)**: -6.25 m/s
- **Trajectory Analysis**: This obstacle is moving towards the ego vehicle longitudinally and laterally. The rate of approach is significant, indicating potential conflict.
- **MDC Calculation**: Calculating the intersection of the obstacle and ego paths suggests a potentially close encounter but not a collision at current progression.
- **TTC Calculation**:
  - Longitudinal TTC ≈ 8.35 / 4.33 ≈ 1.93 s
  - Lateral TTC ≈ 9.92 / 6.25 ≈ 1.59 s
- **Risk Level**: Medium Risk (3) because both TTCs suggest approaching but manageable with proper actions.

#### Obstacle 30670
- **Position**: Front-right
- **Adjusted Longitudinal Distance**: 11.23 m
- **Adjusted Lateral Distance**: 10.13 m
- **Relative Velocity (Longitudinal)**: -3.70 m/s
- **Relative Velocity (Lateral)**: 8.52 m/s
- **Trajectory Analysis**: This obstacle is approaching longitudinally but moving laterally away to the right. The paths indicate separation laterally despite the longitudinal approach.
- **MDC Calculation**: The continuing lateral separation reduces collision risk despite the longitudinal approach.
- **TTC Calculation**:
  - Longitudinal TTC ≈ 11.23 / 3.70 ≈ 3.03 s
  - Lateral TTC is irrelevant due to diverging lateral movement.
- **Risk Level**: Medium Risk (3) for longitudinal path but safe due to lateral divergence.

            "ObstacleID": "30670",

        }
    ],
    "LowRiskObstacle": [],
    "NegligibleRiskObstacle": [
        {

            "OverallRiskScore": "5"
        }
    ]
}
```

In this analysis, none of the obstacles pose an Extreme Risk (score 1) or result in a Collision (score 0). The obstacles 30669 and 30670 are judged as Medium Risk primarily due to their relative velocities leading to future approach scenarios manageable with proper actions, while 30667 poses negligible risk due to consistently diverging trajectories.
