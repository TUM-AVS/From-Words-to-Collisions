At t=0.9s, Ego is in lanelet 502. Let's analyze the latest positions and trajectories of the obstacles:

* **Obstacle 30667:** Located in lanelet 1230, moving with a velocity of 8.6469 and slight positive acceleration.  While its orientation suggests it might be turning, its lateral distance to Ego remains significant, posing no immediate threat.

* **Obstacle 30669:**  Located in lanelet 496, moving with a velocity of 6.2482.  Its constant negative acceleration suggests it might be braking. Although it's closer to Ego compared to other obstacles, given the current trajectories and distance, the collision risk seems low.

* **Obstacle 30670:** Located in lanelet 498, moving with a velocity of 8.5419 and slight positive acceleration.  Its lateral distance to Ego is significant, presenting no immediate danger.

Based on the provided data, at t=0.9s, no obstacle poses a collision or extreme risk to the Ego vehicle.
