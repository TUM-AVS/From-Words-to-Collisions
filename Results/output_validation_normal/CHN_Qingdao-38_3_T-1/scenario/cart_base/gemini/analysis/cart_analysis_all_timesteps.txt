At t=0.9s, Ego is in lanelet 502. Let's analyze the obstacles:

* **Obstacle 30667:** Located in lanelet 1230,  position (-121.3982, -1666.9124). While laterally separated from Ego (-135.8546, -1672.5688), the y-coordinates suggest potential longitudinal proximity in the near future, especially considering Ego's decelerating trajectory. However, without lanelet map information, it's impossible to determine the exact road geometry and inter-lanelet connections. Thus, we can't definitively categorize this as an extreme risk. More information about lanelet connectivity is needed.

* **Obstacle 30669:** Located in lanelet 496, position (-123.6591, -1660.3371). Similar to the previous obstacle, lateral separation exists, but longitudinal proximity may become a concern.  Lanelet information is again crucial to determine the actual risk.

* **Obstacle 30670:** Located in lanelet 498, position (-119.482, -1683.4077). This obstacle poses the most immediate concern. Its y-coordinate (-1683.4077) is much closer to Ego's (-1672.5688) than the other obstacles. Combined with the lateral proximity, there's a higher chance of a near-term collision if their trajectories continue on the current course.  Lanelet context is crucial, but this appears to be a potential high or extreme risk scenario.

    "Reasoning": "No imminent collision detected at t=0.9s, but Obstacle 30670 in lanelet 498 shows potential for high risk due to longitudinal and lateral proximity to Ego.  Lack of lanelet map data prevents definitive extreme risk assessment."
