### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep (0.9 seconds):

### Obstacle Analysis:
1. **Obstacle ID: 30667.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Located at (-121.3982, -1666.9124), moving towards the ego vehicle's trajectory. Distance is decreasing over time.
   - **Distance safety score**: 2 (High Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: Relative velocity is ~4.4 m/s (ego: 4.24 m/s, obstacle: 8.6469 m/s). TTC â‰ˆ 3.6 seconds (distance ~16 m).
   - **Time safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 2 (High Risk)

2. **Obstacle ID: 30669.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Located at (-123.6591, -1660.3371), moving away from the ego vehicle's path. Distance is increasing.
   - **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: Relative velocity is ~-2 m/s (ego: 4.24 m/s, obstacle: 6.2482 m/s). No immediate collision risk.
   - **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low Risk)

3. **Obstacle ID: 30670.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Located at (-119.482, -1683.4077), moving away from the ego vehicle's path. Distance is stable.
   - **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: Relative velocity is ~-4.3 m/s (ego: 4.24 m/s, obstacle: 8.5419 m/s). No collision risk.
   - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. **Obstacle 30667.0** is the only high-risk obstacle, but its TTC (~3.6s) and trajectory indicate a manageable risk with no immediate collision.
2. Other obstacles are moving away or have negligible risk.
3. No obstacles are in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle (502.0).
4. Ego is decelerating, further reducing collision risk.
