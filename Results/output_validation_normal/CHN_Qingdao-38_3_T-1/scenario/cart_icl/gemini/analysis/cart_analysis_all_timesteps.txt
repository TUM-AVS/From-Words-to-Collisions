### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 30666.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is in a different lanelet and relatively far from the ego vehicle. The trajectories over time suggest no imminent risk.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason:  The obstacle's velocity is higher than the ego vehicle's, but the relative direction and lanelet positions mitigate the risk.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- Obstacle ID: 30667.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is in a different lanelet and not posing an immediate threat.  Past trajectory data confirms this assessment.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason:  The obstacle's velocity is similar to the ego vehicle's, and the relative motion suggests no immediate danger.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- Obstacle ID: 30669.0
- Distance Risk reason: This obstacle is in a different lanelet and relatively far from the ego vehicle. The history of positions indicates no convergence.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: The obstacle's velocity is similar to the ego vehicle, and their trajectories are diverging.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- Obstacle ID: 30670.0
- Distance Risk reason: This obstacle is in a different lanelet, and its position relative to the ego vehicle suggests no immediate collision risk.  Trajectory history confirms this.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: The obstacle's velocity is slightly higher than the ego vehicle's, but the lanelet separation and trajectories mitigate the risk.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
The ego vehicle is decelerating within its lanelet.  All obstacles are in different lanelets, with no indication of any lane changes or trajectories that would lead to a collision in the immediate future based on the current data. Thus, this is not a collision scenario.
