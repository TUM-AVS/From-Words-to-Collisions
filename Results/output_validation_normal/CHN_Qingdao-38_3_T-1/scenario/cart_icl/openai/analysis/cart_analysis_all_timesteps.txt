### Obstacle Analysis:

#### Obstacle ID: 30666
- **Distance Risk Reason**: Positioned 15-20 meters from the ego vehicle in a relatively separate lanelet. Movement mainly longitudinally away from the ego.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 5
- **Time Risk Reason**: Increasing velocity consistently, moving away in a separate trajectory with increasing separation.
- **Time Safety Score**: 5
- **Overall Risk Score**: 5

#### Obstacle ID: 30667
- **Distance Risk Reason**: Slightly closer at around 14-16 meters from the ego vehicle but situated in a different lanelet; movements are lateral with a diverging trajectory.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 4
- **Time Risk Reason**: Moderate velocity with slight fluctuations, tends to maintain a constant distance away from the ego.
- **Time Safety Score**: 4
- **Overall Risk Score**: 4

#### Obstacle ID: 30669
- **Distance Risk Reason**: Approximately 13-15 meters from the ego but positioned diverging laterally in its lanelet. Continuous slowing down.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 4
- **Time Risk Reason**: Reducing velocity indicates moving deceleration, which reduces risk of longitudinal collision.
- **Time Safety Score**: 4
- **Overall Risk Score**: 4

#### Obstacle ID: 30670
- **Distance Risk Reason**: Located 20+ meters from the ego, further separating based on its position within the lanelet.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 5
- **Time Risk Reason**: Steady velocity with minor acceleration fluctuations, maintaining a parallel but separate trajectory.
- **Time Safety Score**: 5
- **Overall Risk Score**: 5

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
- The ego vehicle and obstacles demonstrate separate trajectories, showing divergence over time.
- Obstacles have not shown any sudden direction changes toward the ego vehicle's path.
- All obstacles are located in different lanelets, and there is no intersection with the ego trajectory for immediate concern.
