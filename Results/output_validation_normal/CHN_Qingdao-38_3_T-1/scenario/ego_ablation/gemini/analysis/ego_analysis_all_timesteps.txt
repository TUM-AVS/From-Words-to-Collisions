Obstacle 30669 is approaching the ego vehicle longitudinally at -4.33 m/s and laterally at -6.25 m/s.  Its longitudinal distance is decreasing to 8.35m, posing a high risk. While other obstacles are present, their longitudinal velocities and distances suggest they are moving away or maintaining a safe distance in the immediate future. Obstacle 30669 represents the most significant risk in this timestep.
