At t=0.9s, obstacle 30669 is closest to the ego vehicle with a longitudinal distance of 8.35m and a lateral distance of 9.92m. It is moving towards the ego vehicle both longitudinally (-4.33 m/s) and laterally (-6.25 m/s). Although the distances are decreasing, given the current velocities and the absence of data for the subsequent timestep, it's difficult to definitively classify this as an immediate collision.  Obstacles 30667 and 30670 are further away and do not present an immediate collision risk in this timestep.
