### Safety analysis for timestep 0.9 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

There is no information on vehicle size or shape, which are important for defining the actual collision point and calculating a realistic TTC and MDC. I will assume vehicles are point masses to proceed with an approximate calculation. If vehicle dimensions are known, this analysis should be redone using those dimensions.  Also, "adjusted distances" are not provided in the context. I will use the provided real distances, assuming they are somehow adjusted.

**Obstacle Analysis:**

- **Obstacle ID: 30667**
    - Distance Risk reason:  Located 10.24m longitudinally and laterally in the Front-left, moving away longitudinally and laterally.
    - Distance safety score: 5
    - Time Risk reason: Moving away from the ego vehicle. TTC calculations are not relevant since the distance is increasing.
    - Time safety score: 5
    - Overall Risk score: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 30669**
    - Distance Risk reason: Located 8.35m longitudinally and laterally in the Front-left and closing. This represents a significantly close proximity.
    - Distance safety score: 2
    - Time Risk reason: Approaching the ego vehicle longitudinally and laterally. Without explicit ego vehicle motion information, precise TTC cannot be calculated. However, given the short distance and closing velocities, it's likely to be very low.
    - Time safety score: 2
    - Overall Risk score: 2

- **Obstacle ID: 30670**
    - Distance Risk reason:  Located 11.23m longitudinally and laterally in the Front-right.  The motion description indicates it is closing longitudinally but moving laterally relative to the ego vehicle, making the risk assessment more complex.
    - Distance safety score: 4
    - Time Risk reason:  Closing longitudinally, but the lateral motion adds uncertainty. While the distance is not immediately concerning, the longitudinal closing velocity suggests a potential risk if the lateral movement aligns with the ego vehicle's path in the near future. A precise TTC can't be calculated without the ego vehicle motion, but moderate concern is warranted.
    - Time safety score: 3
    - Overall Risk score: 3


### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
    "CollisionObstacle": null,
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null,
    "IsCollisionScenario": false,
    "Justification": "No obstacle is currently colliding, but Obstacle 30669 poses a high risk due to its proximity and closing velocity. Further monitoring and potential evasive maneuvers are recommended, especially considering the uncertain future trajectory due to combined longitudinal and lateral motion."
