* **Obstacle 30667:**

    * **Trajectory Analysis:** This obstacle begins directly in front of the ego vehicle (lateral distance 0.00m) and maintains a near-zero lateral distance while slightly drifting left.  Longitudinally, it is moving away from the ego vehicle across all timesteps.
    * **TTC:** Since the relative longitudinal velocity is positive (0.27 m/s) and the distance is positive, TTC is not meaningful as the vehicles are moving apart.  Lateral velocity is positive and thus TTC can be calculated. Lateral distance of 3.23m / 7.38m/s = 0.44s
    * **MDC:** Given the trajectory and motion description ("moving away longitudinally"), the primary concern is the lateral distance, which is 3.23m. Thus, MDC is approximately 3.23m.
    * **Risk Assessment:** Laterally, the obstacle poses a medium risk (3) due to its MDC of 3.23m, but longitudinally it presents no risk (5) as it's moving away from the ego vehicle.  The minimal lateral distance coupled with the quickly decreasing TTC results in an overall risk score of 3.

* **Obstacle 30669:**

    * **Trajectory Analysis:** This obstacle is approaching the ego vehicle both longitudinally and laterally from the front-left.  Both distances decrease across all timesteps.
    * **TTC:** Longitudinal TTC: 8.35m / 4.33m/s = 1.93s. Lateral TTC: 9.92m / 6.25m/s = 1.59s
    * **MDC:**  Since the obstacle is approaching diagonally, we consider the smaller of the two distances, which is the longitudinal distance of 8.35m.  Therefore, MDC is approximately 8.35m.
    * **Risk Assessment:** Both TTC values (longitudinal and lateral) suggest a Medium Risk (3). The MDC also suggests no risk (5). We prioritize the higher risk, which is an overall risk of 3.

* **Obstacle 30670:**

    * **Trajectory Analysis:** This obstacle is approaching the ego vehicle longitudinally from the front-right while its lateral movement is towards the ego vehicle as well.
    * **TTC:** Longitudinal TTC: 11.23m / 3.70m/s = 3.04s. Lateral TTC: 10.13m / 8.52m/s = 1.19s
    * **MDC:**  The obstacle is approaching diagonally, so we focus on the smaller distance which is the lateral distance. MDC is thus approximately 10.13m.
    * **Risk Assessment:**  The longitudinal TTC suggests a Low risk (4), while the lateral TTC suggests a Medium risk (3). MDC suggests No risk(5). The overall risk is 3.



* **Collision Scenario Determination:** No obstacle has a risk score of 0 or 1.  Therefore, this is NOT a collision scenario.
