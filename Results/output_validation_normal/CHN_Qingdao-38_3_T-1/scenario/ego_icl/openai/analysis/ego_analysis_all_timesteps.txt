### Obstacle-by-Obstacle Analysis

#### Obstacle 30666:
- **Position at most recent timestep (0.9 seconds):** 
  - Adjusted longitudinal distance: 9.45 m
  - Adjusted lateral distance: -23.17 m
- **Relative velocity components:** 
  - Longitudinal: -2.91 m/s (moving away in the longitudinal direction)
  - Lateral: -11.23 m/s (moving away laterally)
- **Trajectory Analysis:**
  - The obstacle is moving away from the ego vehicle in both directions.
  - The obstacle begins to separate more significantly over time, with the lateral distance increasing.
- **TTC Calculations:**
  - Longitudinal TTC: Not applicable (since moving apart)
  - Lateral TTC: Not applicable (since moving apart)
- **Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC):**
  - No immediate collision path due to the increase in lateral distance.
- **Risk Assessment:** 
  - Longitudinal: No risk
  - Lateral: No risk
- **Overall Risk Score:** 5 (No Risk)

#### Obstacle 30667:
- **Position at most recent timestep (0.9 seconds):** 
  - Adjusted longitudinal distance: 10.24 m
  - Adjusted lateral distance: 3.23 m
- **Relative velocity components:** 
  - Longitudinal: 0.27 m/s (moving slightly away longitudinally)
  - Lateral: 7.38 m/s (moving away laterally)
- **Trajectory Analysis:**
  - Obstacle is moving away from the ego vehicle in both directions.
- **TTC Calculations:**
  - Longitudinal TTC: Not critical (small velocity away)
  - Lateral TTC: Not applicable (moving away)
- **Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC):**
  - No collision path.
- **Risk Assessment:** 
  - Longitudinal: No risk
  - Lateral: No risk
- **Overall Risk Score:** 5 (No Risk)

#### Obstacle 30669:
- **Position at most recent timestep (0.9 seconds):** 
  - Adjusted longitudinal distance: 8.35 m
  - Adjusted lateral distance: 9.92 m
- **Relative velocity components:** 
  - Longitudinal: -4.33 m/s (heading towards ego)
  - Lateral: -6.25 m/s (heading towards ego)
- **Trajectory Analysis:**
  - This obstacle poses a converging threat in both longitudinal and lateral components.
- **TTC Calculations:**
  - Longitudinal TTC: 8.35 / 4.33 ≈ 1.93 seconds
  - Lateral TTC: 9.92 / 6.25 ≈ 1.59 seconds
- **Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC):**
  - Converging trajectory, potentially with <3 meters in future.
- **Risk Assessment:** 
  - Longitudinal: Medium Risk (1.93 seconds)
  - Lateral: Medium Risk (1.59 seconds)
- **Overall Risk Score:** 3 (Medium Risk)

#### Obstacle 30670:
- **Position at most recent timestep (0.9 seconds):** 
  - Adjusted longitudinal distance: 11.23 m
  - Adjusted lateral distance: -10.13 m
- **Relative velocity components:** 
  - Longitudinal: -3.70 m/s (approaching longitudinally)
  - Lateral: 8.52 m/s (moving away laterally)
- **Trajectory Analysis:**
  - Approaching longitudinally but increasing lateral separation.
- **TTC Calculations:**
  - Longitudinal TTC: 11.23 / 3.70 ≈ 3.03 seconds
  - Lateral TTC: Not applicable (moving away laterally)
- **Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC):**
  - Increasing lateral spread reduces collision likelihood.
- **Risk Assessment:** 
  - Longitudinal: Medium Risk (3.03 seconds)
  - Lateral: No risk
- **Overall Risk Score:** 3 (Medium Risk)

### Collision Determination

No obstacles currently meet the criteria for a collision (score 0) or present an extreme risk scenario (score 1).

### JSON Summary

```json
{
    "CollisionObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "None",
        "OverallRiskScore": "None"
    },
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "None",
        "OverallRiskScore": "None"
    },
    "IsCollisionScenario": false,
    "Justification": "No obstacles are within extreme risk or collision range; trajectories indicate either separation or medium risk far from collision."
}
```

### Conclusion
This is not a collision scenario as no obstacles present an immediate or near-immediate collision threat. Most obstacles are either moving away or have trajectories that suggest sufficient separation.
