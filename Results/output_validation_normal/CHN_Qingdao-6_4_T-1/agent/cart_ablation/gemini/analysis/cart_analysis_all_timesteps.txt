Obstacle 30680 is consistently far from the ego vehicle and poses no risk.

Obstacle 30686 is initially stationary and distant from the ego vehicle. However, at t=0.4s, it starts moving and by t=0.9s its y-coordinate is -2206.6921 while the ego vehicle's y-coordinate is -2211.9172. The distance is decreasing, and although a collision isn't imminent within the next second, the movement of this obstacle needs to be carefully monitored.  There is potential for high risk in the near future if its trajectory continues towards the ego vehicle's path.
