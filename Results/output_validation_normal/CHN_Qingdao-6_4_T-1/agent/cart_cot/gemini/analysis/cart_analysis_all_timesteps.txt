Here's a breakdown of the collision analysis at t=0.9s:

**Ego Vehicle State (t=0.9s):**
* Position: (710.1132, -2211.9172)
* Orientation: 2.4236 radians
* Velocity: 4.0509 (units assumed to be m/s)
* Acceleration: -1.2189 (units assumed to be m/s^2)

**Obstacle 30680 State (t=0.9s):**
* Position: (704.1243, -2184.3533)
* Orientation: 1.6228 radians
* Velocity: 2.0218 m/s
* Acceleration: -0.6633 m/s^2

**Obstacle 30686 State (t=0.9s):**
* Position: (704.9803, -2206.6921)
* Orientation: 1.6254 radians
* Velocity: 1.5808 m/s
* Acceleration: 2.7677 m/s^2

**Analysis:**

1. **Obstacle 30680:** This obstacle is quite far from the ego vehicle, laterally and longitudinally.  While it's moving slightly slower than the ego vehicle and decelerating less aggressively, the large separation suggests a low risk of collision.

2. **Obstacle 30686:** This obstacle is much closer to the ego vehicle than Obstacle 30680.  It's located slightly behind and to the left of the ego vehicle, and appears to be accelerating. The proximity combined with the relative motion suggests a much higher risk compared to Obstacle 30680.  Additional future timesteps are necessary for a more accurate assessment. However, based on the provided data, we can only classify the current risk as medium at this point.  It's essential to see if its lateral movement will take it further away from or closer to the ego vehicle's path.

**Calculations (Approximations at t=0.9s):**

Due to the limited information (only two consecutive time steps to infer velocity and acceleration at t=0.9s for Obstacle 30686), precise TTC and MDC calculations are difficult. We will provide estimations:

* **Obstacle 30680:**  MDC is approximately sqrt((710.1132 - 704.1243)^2 + (-2211.9172 - -2184.3533)^2) = 27.9 meters. TTC estimation is unreliable with the given data but likely high given the separation. Risk Score: 4 (Low Risk)


* **Obstacle 30686:** MDC is approximately sqrt((710.1132 - 704.9803)^2 + (-2211.9172 - -2206.6921)^2) = 5.7 meters. Given its acceleration and proximity, the risk is significantly higher. Risk Score: 3 (Medium Risk).
