### Analysis:

1. **Obstacle 30686.0**:  
   - **Position**: (704.9803, -2206.6921)  
   - **Velocity**: 1.5808 m/s (accelerating at 2.7677 m/s²)  
   - **Orientation**: 1.6254 rad  
   - **Relative Motion**: The obstacle is moving towards the ego vehicle's path. The lateral distance is decreasing, and the obstacle is accelerating.  
   - **TTC**: The relative distance is decreasing, but the TTC is still positive (not immediate collision).  
   - **Risk**: **High Risk (2)** - The obstacle is closing in but still has some distance and time to react.  

2. **Obstacle 30680.0**:  
   - **Position**: (704.1243, -2184.3533)  
   - **Velocity**: 2.0218 m/s (decelerating at -0.6633 m/s²)  
   - **Orientation**: 1.6228 rad  
   - **Relative Motion**: The obstacle is moving away from the ego vehicle's path. The lateral distance is increasing.  
   - **TTC**: Not applicable (moving away).  
   - **Risk**: **Negligible Risk (5)** - No significant risk of collision.
