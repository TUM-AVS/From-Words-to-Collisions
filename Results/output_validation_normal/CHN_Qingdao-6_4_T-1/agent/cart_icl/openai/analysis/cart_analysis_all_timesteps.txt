Based on the data provided for the scenario at 0.9 seconds, let's evaluate each obstacle's trajectory and relative motion with respect to the ego vehicle:

### Ego Vehicle:
- **Position**: (710.1132, -2211.9172)
- **Velocity**: 4.0509 m/s 
- **Acceleration**: -1.2189 m/s² 
- **Orientation**: Heading in a direction relatively stable within 2.42-2.55 radians 

### Obstacle 30680:
- **Position**: (704.1243, -2184.3533)
- **Velocity**: 2.0218 m/s 
- **Acceleration**: -0.6633 m/s² 
- **Orientation**: 1.6228 radians 
- **Relative Position**: ~27.56m away, considering both X and Y differences
- **Relative Velocity**: Considerably slower and moving away; no collision path evident

**Risk Rotation and Analysis:**
- **TTC & MDC**: Current trends show no significant approach or path crossing with a minimum distance greater than lane width; calculated roughly >10 seconds for close lateral encounter given steady speeds.
- **Risk Assessment**: Despite being on a different lane (516), there is no significant risk due to the minimal horizontal and lateral movement towards the ego's trajectory.

### Obstacle 30686:
- **Position**: (704.9803, -2206.6921)
- **Velocity**: 1.5808 m/s 
- **Acceleration**: 2.7677 m/s² 
- **Relative Position**: ~7.64m away
- **Relative Velocity**: Increasing speed with positive acceleration; significant lateral distance

**Risk Rotation and Analysis:**
- **TTC & MDC**: Initial contact of any kind seems over 4 seconds from now at present speeds; still moving laterally off-course as its position shifts.
- **Risk Assessment**: This obstacle shows a shred of potential risk due mostly to its minor lane jet in a positive manner yet remains in another lane (1247).

### Conclusion:
None of the respective obstacles matches a path that will converge to a collision with the ego vehicle, nor does their acceleration patterns introduce immediate concern. Therefore, there appears not to be any extreme or high-risk interactions within a traditionally concerning timeframe.
