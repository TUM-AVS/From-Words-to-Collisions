At the most recent timestep (0.9 seconds), obstacle 30686 is at high risk of collision. It is only 2.80 meters in front of the ego vehicle and closing at a speed of -2.95 m/s. Although some lateral movement is detected (-1.13 m/s), the primary concern is the rapidly decreasing longitudinal distance. Obstacle 30680, on the other hand, is further away (18.14m longitudinally and -15.21m laterally) and moving at a slower closing speed of -2.64 m/s longitudinally while moving away laterally. Therefore, it poses a low risk compared to obstacle 30686.
