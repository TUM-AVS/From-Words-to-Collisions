Obstacle 30686 is at high risk.  It is directly in front of the ego vehicle at a distance of only 2.80 meters and closing at a relative longitudinal velocity of -2.95 m/s. While the lateral velocity is non-zero (-1.13 m/s), it's still very close to the center of the ego vehicle's path and represents a substantial risk.

Obstacle 30680 is at medium risk. It is located 18.14 meters in front and to the right of the ego car. Although moving towards the ego longitudinally (-2.64 m/s), it's moving away laterally (-1.45 m/s), reducing the collision risk in the immediate future. Given its current trajectory, the risk appears manageable.
