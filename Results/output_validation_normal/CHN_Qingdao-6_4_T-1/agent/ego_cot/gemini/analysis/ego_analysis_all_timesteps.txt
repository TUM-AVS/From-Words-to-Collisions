### Safety analysis for timestep 0.9s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

**- Obstacle ID: 30680**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is located 18.14m longitudinally and 18.14m laterally in the front-right of the ego vehicle.  This indicates a safe distance.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason:  The relative longitudinal velocity is negative, indicating the obstacle is moving towards the ego vehicle, but the lateral velocity suggests it's moving away. Given the distances and the lateral movement, the TTC is high.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4


**- Obstacle ID: 30686**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is 2.8m longitudinally and 2.8m laterally from the ego vehicle, placing it very close in the front. This represents a high risk of collision.
- Distance safety score: 2
- Time Risk reason: The closing longitudinal velocity and proximity suggest a very short time to collision. The lateral velocity, while present, does not significantly mitigate the longitudinal risk.
- Time safety score: 2
- Overall Risk score: 2
