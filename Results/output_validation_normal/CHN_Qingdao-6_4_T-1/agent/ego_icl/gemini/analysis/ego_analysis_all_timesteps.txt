Obstacle 30680:

* Trajectory Analysis: This obstacle is consistently in the front-right of the ego vehicle.  The longitudinal distance is decreasing slightly across timesteps, while the lateral distance initially increases slightly and then decreases slightly, indicating the obstacle might be moving on a slightly converging trajectory but the ego vehicle and the obstacle 30680 are moving away laterally.

* At t=0.9s:
    * Longitudinal distance: 18.14m
    * Lateral distance: -15.21m
    * Longitudinal relative velocity: -2.64 m/s (approaching)
    * Lateral relative velocity: -1.45 m/s (moving away)

* TTC Calculation:
    * Longitudinal TTC = 18.14m / 2.64 m/s = 6.87s

* MDC Calculation: Due to the substantial lateral distance and diverging lateral trajectory, the MDC is large and does not pose an immediate risk. It can be approximated as the current longitudinal distance, which is 18.14m.

* Risk Assessment:
    * Longitudinal Risk: Low (4) based on TTC
    * Lateral Risk: Negligible (5) given increasing lateral separation
    * Overall Risk: Low (4) - Dominated by the longitudinal approach, but lateral movement reduces overall concern.

Obstacle 30686:

* Trajectory Analysis: This obstacle remains directly in front of the ego vehicle (lateral distance consistently 0.00m), with the longitudinal distance rapidly decreasing across timesteps. This clearly indicates a high risk of collision if the trajectories are maintained.

* At t=0.9s:
    * Longitudinal distance: 2.80m
    * Lateral distance: 0.00m
    * Longitudinal relative velocity: -2.95 m/s (approaching)
    * Lateral relative velocity: -1.13 m/s

* TTC Calculation:
    * Longitudinal TTC = 2.80m / 2.95 m/s = 0.95s

* MDC Calculation: MDC is simply the longitudinal distance of 2.80m since the lateral distance is zero.

* Risk Assessment:
    * Longitudinal Risk: High (2) given the short TTC
    * Lateral Risk: High (2), given the zero lateral distance, any slight lateral movement could still result in collision.
    * Overall Risk: High (2) - The direct longitudinal approach with rapidly decreasing distance makes this obstacle the primary safety concern.
