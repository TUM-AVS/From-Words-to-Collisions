### Analysis

#### Obstacle 30680: Front-right Analysis

- **Trajectory Overview:**
  - Position:
    - Longitudinal distance decreasing: from 19.13m at 0.1s to 18.14m at 0.9s
    - Lateral distance decreasing: from -16.65m at 0.1s to -15.21m at 0.9s
  - Velocity:
    - Longitudinal velocity changes from -5.06 m/s to -2.64 m/s
    - Lateral velocity changes from -2.28 m/s to -1.45 m/s
  - Continuous trajectory toward the ego vehicle longitudinally, moving away laterally

- **Current Assessment (0.9s):**
  - **Adjusted Distances**: Not explicitly provided, assume these are similar to raw due to critical evaluation directive.
  - **MDC**: Since lateral motion is moving away, focus on longitudinal.
  - **TTC Calculation**:
    - Longitudinal: 18.14m / 2.64 m/s ≈ 6.87s
    - Lateral TTC is not a concern as it's moving away.
  - **MDC Calculation**: Longitudinal MDC is continuously decreasing but remains over 15m.

- **Risk Level:**
  - With a TTC of 6.87 seconds and MDC > 15m, this obstacle is of **negligible risk**.

#### Obstacle 30686: Front Analysis

- **Trajectory Overview:**
  - Position:
    - Longitudinal distance decreasing: from 6.80m at 0.1s to 2.80m at 0.9s
    - Lateral distance consistently 0.00m
  - Velocity:
    - Longitudinal velocity changes from -6.75 m/s to -2.95 m/s
    - Lateral velocity modestly changing, not consequential for longitudinal front

- **Current Assessment (0.9s):**
  - **Adjusted Distances**: Assume approximately equal to raw due to critical evaluation directive
  - **Exact Lateral Alignment** - Critical focus on longitudinal
  - **TTC Calculation**:
    - Longitudinal: 2.80m / 2.95 m/s ≈ 0.95s
  - **MDC Calculation**: Lateral 0.00m and rapidly declining longitudinal

- **Risk Level:**
  - With a TTC of 0.95 seconds and rapidly decreasing MDC, this obstacle presents a **high risk**.

The evaluation indicates Obstacle 30686 with a high risk due to a consistently reducing longitudinal distance and short time-to-collision, whereas Obstacle 30680 poses negligible risk due to diverging lateral paths and sufficient TTC.
