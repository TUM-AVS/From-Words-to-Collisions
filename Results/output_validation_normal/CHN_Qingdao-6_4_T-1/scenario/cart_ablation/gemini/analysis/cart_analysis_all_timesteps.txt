At t=0.9s, Ego is in lanelet 1242.0 and decelerating.

Obstacle 30680.0 is in lanelet 516.0 and decelerating.  The distance between Ego and this obstacle is considerable and poses no immediate threat.

Obstacle 30686.0 is in lanelet 1247.0 and accelerating. While the absolute distance between the Ego and Obstacle 30686.0 might seem large, the fact that Obstacle 30686.0 just started moving from a standstill (velocity was 0 in previous timesteps) and is accelerating into Ego's lanelet (or very close proximity) raises concern. This requires further investigation to determine a more precise risk level, as the trajectories could intersect in the near future given the current rate of acceleration of Obstacle 30686 and deceleration of the Ego vehicle. There isn't enough information to definitively categorize this as an *extreme* risk yet, but warrants monitoring.
