At t=0.9s, Ego is in lanelet 1242.0 and decelerating.

Obstacle 30680.0 is in lanelet 516.0 and also decelerating.  The positions and trajectories don't suggest an immediate collision risk.

Obstacle 30686.0 is in lanelet 1247.0 and accelerating.  While the distance between Ego and this obstacle is relatively small (around 90m based on provided coordinates), and they might be approaching the same general area, more information on lanelet geometry and their relative headings is needed to determine if an extreme risk exists. Based on the provided data, it appears the ego vehicle continues to move away from this obstacle and the risk is not extreme.

Therefore, no obstacles present a collision or extreme risk.
