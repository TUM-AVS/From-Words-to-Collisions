### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep (0.9 seconds):

### Obstacle Analysis:
1. **Obstacle ID: 30680.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is in a different lanelet (516.0) and moving away from the ego vehicle (distance increasing over time). The current distance is ~27.56 units, which is safe.
   - **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: The obstacle is moving slowly (2.0218 units/s) and decelerating (-0.6633 units/s²). The relative velocity is low, and the trajectory is diverging.
   - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)

2. **Obstacle ID: 30686.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is in a nearby lanelet (1247.0) and has started moving towards the ego vehicle (distance decreasing from 0.4s onwards). Current distance is ~5.23 units.
   - **Distance safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: The obstacle was stationary but has recently accelerated (1.5808 units/s, acceleration 2.7677 units/s²). The relative velocity is still low but increasing.
   - **Time safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 3 (Medium Risk)

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. Obstacle 30680.0 is moving away and poses no risk.
2. Obstacle 30686.0 was stationary but has started moving towards the ego vehicle. The distance is still safe, but the trend is concerning.
3. No immediate collision risk exists at the current timestep.
4. The scenario requires monitoring of obstacle 30686.0 due to its recent acceleration.
