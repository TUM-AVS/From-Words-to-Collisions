Obstacle 30686 is at high risk of collision. It is very close to the ego vehicle longitudinally (2.80m) and although there is a small lateral velocity (-1.13 m/s) which may suggest it's beginning to move to the side, it is still essentially directly in front.  The closing longitudinal velocity (-2.95 m/s) indicates that the obstacle and the ego vehicle are moving towards each other.  At this closing rate, a collision is likely in the next time step, as it is less than a second, though not quite guaranteed if the ego vehicle brakes and the other object does not. Obstacle 30680 is not a high risk, as it is moving away laterally and is at a safe longitudinal distance.
