Obstacle 30686 is at high risk of collision. In the last timestep (0.9 seconds), it is only 2.80 meters in front of the ego vehicle and moving towards it with a longitudinal relative velocity of -2.95 m/s.  The lateral relative velocity is -1.13 m/s indicating some lateral movement.  The short distance and closing velocity suggest a possible collision in the very near future if the ego vehicle doesn't brake or maneuver.

        "IsCollisionScenario": false,
        "Reasoning": "Obstacle 30686 presents an extreme risk due to its close proximity (2.80m) and closing longitudinal velocity (-2.95 m/s) towards the ego vehicle. While a collision is not certain in the next timestep, the risk is extremely high, warranting an 'Extreme Risk' classification. No collision has occurred yet."
