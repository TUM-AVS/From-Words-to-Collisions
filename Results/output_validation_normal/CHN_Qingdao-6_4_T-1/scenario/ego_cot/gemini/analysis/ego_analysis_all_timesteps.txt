### Safety analysis for timestep 0.9 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

There are no adjusted distances provided.  I will perform the analysis using the provided real distances (DTClong, DTClat) along with relative velocities and accelerations, but note that this analysis would be more accurate with adjusted distances accounting for vehicle size.  I will make assumptions about vehicle size where necessary to approximate risk.

**Obstacle Analysis:**

- **Obstacle ID: 30680**
- **Distance Risk reason:** Obstacle is located at 18.14m longitudinally and 18.14m laterally (front-right) relative to the ego vehicle. This distance is relatively large, suggesting low immediate risk.  However, the obstacle is moving towards the ego vehicle longitudinally.
- **Distance safety score:** 4 (Low Risk)
- **Time Risk reason:** We need adjusted distances and ego vehicle velocity to properly calculate TTC. However, with a decreasing longitudinal velocity difference (-2.64 m/s) and the obstacle moving away laterally, the risk appears low based on the provided data.
- **Time safety score:** 4 (Low Risk)
- **Overall Risk score:** 4 (Low Risk)


- **Obstacle ID: 30686**
- **Distance Risk reason:** Obstacle is located at 2.80m longitudinally and 2.80m laterally (front) relative to the ego vehicle.  This is very close and represents a high risk of collision, assuming average vehicle dimensions.
- **Distance safety score:** 2 (High Risk)
- **Time Risk reason:**  Without ego vehicle velocity and adjusted distance, precise TTC cannot be calculated.  However, a longitudinal closing velocity of -2.95 m/s at a distance of 2.8m suggests a TTC of under 1 second. This represents an extremely high risk. The slight lateral movement doesn't significantly mitigate this.
- **Time safety score:** 1 (Extreme Risk)
- **Overall Risk score:** 1 (Extreme Risk)



### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
  "CollisionObstacle": null,
  "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {
    "ObstacleID": "30686",
    "OverallRiskScore": "1"
  },
  "IsCollisionScenario": false,
  "Justification": "Obstacle 30686 presents an extreme risk with a very short distance and high closing velocity, indicating a likely near-term collision if no evasive action is taken. While no collision is predicted within the provided data timeframe, the risk is imminent.  This assumes average vehicle dimensions; adjusted distances would provide a more definitive assessment."
