Obstacle 30680:

* Trajectory Analysis: This obstacle is consistently in the front-right of the ego vehicle.  Across the timesteps, the longitudinal distance is slightly decreasing, while the lateral distance is increasing (moving further to the right). It appears to be moving away from the ego vehicle's path.

* TTC Calculation: Not applicable given the diverging lateral trajectory described in the context.

* MDC Calculation: Given the diverging trajectory, MDC is increasing. At the last timestep (0.9s), lateral distance is -15.21m, indicating significant separation and low risk of collision with this obstacle.

* Risk Assessment: Based on the diverging trajectories and increasing lateral distances, the risk level for Obstacle 30680 is 5 (No Risk).


Obstacle 30686:

* Trajectory Analysis: This obstacle remains directly in front of the ego vehicle (lateral distance 0.00m), with the longitudinal distance decreasing across all timesteps.  This indicates a high risk of collision if the trajectories are maintained.

* TTC Calculation: At t=0.9s, longitudinal distance is 2.80m and relative longitudinal velocity is -2.95 m/s.  TTC = 2.80 / 2.95 â‰ˆ 0.95 seconds.

* MDC Calculation: Since the obstacle is directly ahead, MDC is primarily determined by the continuously decreasing longitudinal distance, which is 2.80m at the last timestep.

* Risk Assessment: The decreasing longitudinal distance, the lateral alignment, and the calculated TTC of 0.95 seconds all point to a high risk. Therefore, the risk level is 2 (High Risk) due to the imminent potential for collision.


Collision Scenario Determination:

While there is no collision at the final timestep, Obstacle 30686 presents a High Risk (2) due to its position directly ahead of the ego vehicle, rapidly decreasing distance, and a TTC of under 1 second. The scenario is therefore not classified as a collision scenario based on the current data but requires immediate intervention to avoid a collision.
