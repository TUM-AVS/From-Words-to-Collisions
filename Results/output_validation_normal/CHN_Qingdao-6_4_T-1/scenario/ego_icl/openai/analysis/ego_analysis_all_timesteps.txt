### Obstacle-by-Obstacle Analysis

#### **Obstacle 30680**
- **At 0.9 seconds:**
  - **Relative Direction:** Front-right
  - **Adjusted Longitudinal Distance:** 18.14 m
  - **Adjusted Lateral Distance:** -15.21 m
  - **Relative Longitudinal Velocity:** -2.64 m/s (driving toward ego)
  - **Relative Lateral Velocity:** -1.45 m/s (moving laterally away)
  - **Motion Description:** The obstacle is moving toward the ego longitudinally and moving away laterally.

- **Trajectory Analysis:**
  - The obstacle is gradually decreasing its longitudinal distance to the ego vehicle. However, the lateral distance is increasing slightly, indicating a widening gap to the right.

- **TTC Calculation:**
  - **Longitudinal TTC =** 18.14 m / |2.64 m/s| ≈ 6.87 seconds
  - **Lateral TTC =** Not relevant as it's moving away laterally.

- **Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC):** 
  - Using longitudinal distance primarily due to front-right direction.
  - **MDC = 18.14 m (longitudinal component)**

- **Risk Assessment:**
  - **TTC > 5.0 seconds** – No Risk (5)
  - **MDC > 5.0 meters** – No Risk (5)
  - Overall Risk Score for Obstacle 30680 is **5** (No Risk).

#### **Obstacle 30686**
- **At 0.9 seconds:**
  - **Relative Direction:** Front
  - **Adjusted Longitudinal Distance:** 2.80 m
  - **Adjusted Lateral Distance:** 0.00 m
  - **Relative Longitudinal Velocity:** -2.95 m/s (driving toward ego)
  - **Relative Lateral Velocity:** -1.13 m/s (minor lateral shift)
  - **Motion Description:** Exact lateral alignment, moving directly toward the ego.

- **Trajectory Analysis:**
  - The obstacle is rapidly closing in on the ego from a longitudinal standpoint over consecutive timestamps.

- **TTC Calculation:**
  - **Longitudinal TTC =** 2.80 m / |2.95 m/s| ≈ 0.95 seconds

- **Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC):**
  - Using solely longitudinal distance due to direct frontal alignment.
  - **MDC = 2.80 m (longitudinal component)** 

- **Risk Assessment:**
  - **TTC < 1.0 seconds** – High Risk (2)
  - **MDC < 3.0 meters but > 1.0 meters** – Medium Risk (3)
  - Prioritize higher risk (2 for TTC).
  - Overall Risk Score for Obstacle 30686 is **2** (High Risk).

### Conclusion
While obstacle 30680 poses no threat, Obstacle 30686 rapidly approaches directly in front of the ego vehicle, positioning it as a high-risk situation.

This scenario is NOT classified as a collision scenario. Despite a high risk from Obstacle 30686, it does not have a risk score of 0 (collision) or 1 (extreme risk).
