The ego vehicle and obstacle 30675.0 are in the same lanelet (184.0).  Analyzing the provided positions, both are traveling in roughly the same direction (similar orientations). However, the obstacle is ahead of the ego vehicle and decelerating less rapidly.  The distance between them seems to be decreasing over time, suggesting a potential collision risk. Looking at the data, the x-coordinates show the obstacle consistently ahead of the ego vehicle, while the y-coordinates show the obstacle being on the ego vehicleâ€™s right side, indicating a potential side swipe situation if current trajectories continue.  It is difficult to judge the exact distances based on this limited data (only positional data and not the physical dimensions of the vehicles are provided), therefore, the final JSON is populated without an extreme risk obstacle, but certainly with a high-risk obstacle, which calls for more careful analysis.
