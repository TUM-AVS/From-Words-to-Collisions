Both Ego and Obstacle 30675.0 are in the same lanelet (184.0) and moving in roughly the same direction (similar orientations).  The obstacle is initially ahead of the Ego vehicle and both are decelerating.  However, the obstacle's initial speed is higher than the Ego vehicle's.

Looking at the positions, the x-coordinate difference between the Ego and the obstacle decreases slightly over time, suggesting they might be converging. The y-coordinate difference is also decreasing, indicating potential for collision.  While it's difficult to definitively say a collision is certain based solely on the provided data points without performing more precise calculations (e.g., Time-to-Collision, considering vehicle widths), the trend suggests a significant risk, at least in the High Risk category. More information is needed to definitively categorize it as an Extreme Risk or Collision.
