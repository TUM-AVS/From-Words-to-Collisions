Here's the collision risk analysis for the provided scenario:

**Analysis at t=0.9s:**

The latest data point we have is at t=0.9s.  We must extrapolate obstacle motion based on previous behavior.  

* **Ego:** Position (621.283, -2234.7145), velocity ~22.35 m/s, acceleration ~ -2.17 m/s²
* **Obstacle 30675.0:** We don't have an explicit position at t=0.9s for the obstacle. Based on the previous positions and velocities, the obstacle seems to be moving roughly parallel to the ego vehicle, but faster and with greater deceleration. A simple linear extrapolation might not be accurate enough due to the non-constant acceleration.  It's important to note this limitation in a real-world system, more sophisticated prediction methods would be used (e.g., Kalman filtering).  

Assuming roughly constant acceleration for a short prediction window, we can estimate the obstacle's position at t=0.9s:

* At t=0.4s: position (629.0021, -2218.7667), velocity 28.1268 m/s, acceleration -6.4884 m/s²
* Change in time: 0.9s - 0.4s = 0.5s
* Estimated position at t=0.9s : x = 629.0021 + 28.1268 * 0.5 + 0.5 * -6.4884 * 0.5² ≈ 642.38, y = -2218.7667 + (28.1268 + (-6.4884 * 0.5)) * 0.5 ≈ -2204.65

Therefore, the estimated position at t=0.9s is (642.38, -2204.65)

**Metrics Calculation:**

* **Longitudinal TTC:**  Assuming constant velocity, the difference in x positions is about 21 meters.  The obstacle is faster and decelerating less than the ego vehicle. Although the speed difference is not drastic and the deceleration could help, the current longitudinal distance is still cause for concern.
* **Lateral TTC:**  The difference in y positions is around -30 meters and appears relatively stable based on past time steps.  This suggests the lateral risk is currently low.
* **MDC:** The distance at t=0.9s is approximately sqrt((642.38-621.283)^2 + (-2204.65 - -2234.7145)^2) ≈ 35.58 meters. While not immediately dangerous, it warrants close attention.

**Risk Assessment at t=0.9s:**

Given the decreasing MDC, the higher velocity of the obstacle, and its significant deceleration (potentially indicating braking), the situation presents a Medium Risk (3).  It is manageable with proper reactions, such as adjusting the ego vehicle's speed or slightly altering its path. However, continued monitoring and potential intervention are necessary.
