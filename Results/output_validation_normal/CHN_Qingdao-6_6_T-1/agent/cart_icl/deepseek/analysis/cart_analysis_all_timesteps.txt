### Analysis:

1. **Trajectory and Relative Motion**:
   - The ego vehicle and obstacle (ID: 30675) are both in the same lanelet (184.0), indicating a potential for collision if their paths converge.
   - The obstacle is ahead of the ego vehicle and moving at a higher velocity (28.1268 m/s at 0.4s) compared to the ego vehicle (24.8575 m/s at 0.4s). However, the obstacle is decelerating at a higher rate (-6.4884 m/s²) compared to the ego vehicle (-2.6479 m/s²).

2. **Time to Collision (TTC)**:
   - At 0.4s, the relative longitudinal distance between the ego and the obstacle is approximately:
     - Ego position: (615.9859, -2245.5232)
     - Obstacle position: (629.0021, -2218.7667)
     - Distance = sqrt((629.0021 - 615.9859)² + (-2218.7667 - (-2245.5232))²) ≈ 27.0m
   - Relative longitudinal velocity = Obstacle velocity - Ego velocity = 28.1268 - 24.8575 ≈ 3.27 m/s
   - TTC = Distance / Relative velocity ≈ 27.0 / 3.27 ≈ 8.26s (This is a rough estimate; exact TTC would require more precise relative position and velocity calculations.)

3. **Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC)**:
   - Given the deceleration rates, the obstacle is slowing down faster than the ego vehicle, which reduces the risk of collision over time.
   - The lateral distance is negligible since both are in the same lanelet.

4. **Risk Assessment**:
   - The TTC is relatively high (≈8.26s), indicating that there is sufficient time for the ego vehicle to react and avoid a collision.
   - The obstacle is decelerating faster than the ego vehicle, which further reduces the risk.
   - The overall risk is **Low (4)** since there is no immediate danger, and the ego vehicle has time to adjust its speed or lane if necessary.
