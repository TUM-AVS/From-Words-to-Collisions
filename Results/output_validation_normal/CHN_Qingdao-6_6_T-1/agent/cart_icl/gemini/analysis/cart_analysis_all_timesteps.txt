At t=0.9s, only the ego vehicle's information is available.  We can only assess risk based on the provided data up to t=0.4s, where we have information for both ego and obstacle 30675.

The obstacle is ahead of the ego vehicle and in the same lanelet (184).  Let's analyze the data at t=0.4s:

* **Position:** Obstacle is at (629.0021, -2218.7667) and Ego is at (615.9859, -2245.5232).  The obstacle is approximately 13 meters ahead in the x-direction and 27 meters north in the y-direction. The vehicles are therefore roughly 30m apart.

* **Velocity:** Obstacle velocity is 28.1268 m/s and Ego velocity is 24.8575 m/s. The obstacle is moving slightly faster than the ego vehicle.

* **Acceleration:** The obstacle has a constant negative acceleration (-6.4884 m/s²) indicating it is braking. The ego vehicle's braking is increasing from -0.4301 m/s² up to -2.6479 m/s².

* **TTC and MDC Estimation:**  While calculating precise TTC is complex due to the non-constant accelerations, a simplified assumption using the relative velocity at 0.4s (28.1268 - 24.8575 = 3.2693 m/s) and longitudinal distance (around 13 meters) gives an approximate TTC of roughly 4 seconds (13 / 3.2693). The actual value is expected to be higher since both vehicles are decelerating.  The lateral deviation of around 27m suggests there's no immediate risk of collision even if they continued with roughly same speeds.


**Risk Assessment:**

Given the longitudinal separation, the fact that the obstacle is moving slightly faster but decelerating more aggressively than the ego, combined with the significant lateral difference, we can estimate the overall risk at t=0.4s as low. If they maintain their respective lanes, a collision is unlikely.
