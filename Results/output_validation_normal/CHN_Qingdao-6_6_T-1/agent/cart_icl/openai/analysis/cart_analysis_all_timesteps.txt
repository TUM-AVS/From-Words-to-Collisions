### Analysis:

Let's analyze the trajectory and potential risks associated with the ego vehicle and the obstacle in the scenario.

#### Ego Vehicle Analysis:
- **Position Trend:** The ego vehicle progresses consistently along the lanelet 184, moving away from its initial coordinates over the span of 0.9 seconds.
- **Velocity and Acceleration:** The velocity of the ego vehicle is gradually decreasing from 25.8658 m/s to 22.3478 m/s, with varying deceleration rates (negative acceleration), indicating a consistent slowing down.
- **Orientation:** Orientation remains approximately the same throughout the steps, indicating a straight path follows within lanelet 184.

#### Obstacle Analysis (Obstacle 30675.0):
- **Position and Movement:** The obstacle maintains a position further from the initial spot of the ego but travels in the same forward-facing direction within lanelet 184. The position changes gradually from (625.247, -2226.5937) to (629.0021, -2218.7667).
- **Velocity and Acceleration:** The velocity decreases from 30.0733 m/s to 28.1268 m/s, accompanied by a significant negative acceleration, meaning the obstacle is slowing down more gradually than the ego vehicle.
  
#### Relative Motion and Collision Risk:
- **Relative Longitudinal Position and Velocity:** In the latest timestep, both the ego and the obstacle are in the same lanelet, and the obstacle travels ahead of the ego.
- **Distance Calculation:** By the last position data (at 0.4s), consider only data up to 0.4s as obstacle data is absent beyond this point, the distance along the trajectory between the ego and the obstacle can be estimated using their position changes.
- **TTC and MDC Considerations:** Based on the positions and consistent deceleration, the obstacle is further away from the ego and appears to be continuously decelerating, thus there exists sufficient space and reaction time for the ego to avoid a collision at existing speeds.

Overall, there is sufficient buffer and decelerating movement which, without abrupt changes, suggests no immediate collisions are foreseen in the current trajectory analysis.

#### Conclusion:
Given the ego's continuous decrease in velocity and the obstacle's steady deceleration and distance, the risk assessment is **Low Risk** with no immediate or high collision threats noted.
