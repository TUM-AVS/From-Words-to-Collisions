The obstacle is moving away from the ego vehicle longitudinally, and the lateral distance is zero or unknown.  At the last reported timestep (0.4 seconds), the obstacle is 25.25 meters ahead longitudinally and has a positive longitudinal relative velocity (3.27 m/s), indicating it is moving away. While the lateral relative velocity is slightly positive (0.26 m/s), the obstacle's lateral acceleration is negative (-3.47 m/sÂ²), suggesting a potential turn away from the ego vehicle's path.  Given the increasing longitudinal distance and the dynamics suggesting no immediate lateral encroachment, the risk appears low.
