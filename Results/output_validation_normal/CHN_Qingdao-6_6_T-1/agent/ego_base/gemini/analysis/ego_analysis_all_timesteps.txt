The most recent timestep with data (0.4 seconds) shows Obstacle 30675 moving away from the ego vehicle. The longitudinal distance is increasing, and the relative longitudinal velocity is positive (though decreasing).  While there is some lateral movement, it's minimal and the obstacle remains directly in front of the ego vehicle. Based on the available data, the risk is decreasing over time.  Since the later timesteps are blank, we cannot assess the ultimate outcome but based on the trend, there is no immediate risk.
