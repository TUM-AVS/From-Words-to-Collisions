### Safety analysis for timestep 0.9 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 30675
- Distance Risk reason:  Obstacle 30675 is moving away from the ego vehicle with increasing longitudinal distance (from 24.25m to 25.25m  in 0.4 seconds). Lateral distance also increases. The relative motion suggests divergence, not convergence.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Since the obstacle is moving away, TTC is not applicable in a collision avoidance context.  The relative velocity and acceleration indicate increasing separation.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5
