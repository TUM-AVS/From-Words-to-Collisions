### Obstacle Analysis: Obstacle 30675

#### Trajectory Analysis:
- **Timestep 0.1s**: 
  - Longitudinal distance: 24.25m (moving away at 4.33 m/s)
  - Lateral distance: 0.00m (moving away at 0.12 m/s)
- **Timestep 0.2s**: 
  - Longitudinal distance: 24.63m (moving away at 3.89 m/s)
  - Lateral distance: 0.00m (moving away at 0.21 m/s)
- **Timestep 0.3s**: 
  - Longitudinal distance: 24.96m (moving away at 3.47 m/s)
  - Lateral distance: 0.00m (moving away at 0.24 m/s)
- **Timestep 0.4s (Most Recent)**:
  - Longitudinal distance: 25.25m (moving away at 3.27 m/s)
  - Lateral distance: 0.00m (moving away at 0.26 m/s)

#### Key Observations:
1. **Longitudinal Motion**: The obstacle is consistently moving away from the ego vehicle (positive longitudinal distance increasing over time, relative velocity positive but decreasing).
2. **Lateral Motion**: The obstacle is laterally aligned (0.00m) but moving away slightly (positive lateral velocity).

#### Risk Assessment:
1. **Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC)**:
   - Longitudinal: 25.25m (Low Risk, MDC > 5.0m)
   - Lateral: 0.00m (but moving away, so no collision risk)
   - **Overall MDC Risk**: 5 (Negligible Risk)

2. **Time-to-Collision (TTC)**:
   - Longitudinal: Not applicable (moving away, relative velocity positive).
   - Lateral: Not applicable (moving away, relative velocity positive).
   - **Overall TTC Risk**: 5 (Negligible Risk)

3. **Motion Description**: The obstacle is moving away longitudinally and laterally, with no indication of converging paths.

#### Overall Risk:
- **Highest Risk Score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- No collision or extreme risk detected.
