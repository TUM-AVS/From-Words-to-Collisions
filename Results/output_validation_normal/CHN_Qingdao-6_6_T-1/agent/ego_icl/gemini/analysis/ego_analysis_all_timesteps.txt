Obstacle 30675 is in front of the ego vehicle and moving away.  Across the provided timesteps, the longitudinal distance is increasing, indicating a diverging trajectory.  Let's analyze the most recent timestep (0.9 seconds which is missing in the provided data). Since we don't have the 0.9s data, we will base our analysis on the last available data, which is at 0.4 seconds.

At 0.4 seconds:
- Longitudinal distance: 25.25 m
- Lateral distance: 0.00 m
- Longitudinal relative velocity: 3.27 m/s (moving away)
- Lateral relative velocity: 0.26 m/s

Since the obstacle is moving away longitudinally, the risk of collision is negligible. The lateral distance being 0.00 m indicates they are in the same lane but given the diverging longitudinal trajectory, this doesn't pose a collision risk.

Because the longitudinal relative velocity is positive (moving away), TTC is not meaningful in this case. MDC is primarily based on the lateral distance, which is 0 m, but combined with the increasing longitudinal distance, there is no collision risk.


Based on the available data, the risk assessment for Obstacle 30675 at t=0.4s is Negligible Risk (5).
