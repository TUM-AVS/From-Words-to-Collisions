### Obstacle-by-Obstacle Analysis

#### Obstacle 30675

- **Trajectory Analysis:**
  - Positions over time indicate the obstacle is moving away from the ego vehicle.
  - Longitudinal distances are increasing steadily from 24.25 m at 0.1 seconds to 25.25 m at 0.4 seconds.
  - Longitudinal velocity is consistently positive, indicating the obstacle is moving away: starts at 4.33 m/s and reduces slightly to 3.27 m/s, showing decreasing speed.
  - Lateral components are negligible with slight positive values, indicating minor lateral movement away from the ego vehicle.

- **TTC and MDC Calculations:**
  - **TTC (Time-to-Collision):**
    - Since the obstacle is moving away (positive relative longitudinal velocity), no time-to-collision exists in this scenario as the distance increases. Hence, TTC is not applicable.
  - **MDC (Minimum Distance to Collision):**
    - The obstacle is perfectly aligned in the same lane (lateral distance = 0.00m), but longitudinal trajectory shows increasing distance.
    - MDC here is effectively increasing, as the distance at the most recent timestep (25.25 m) is larger than previous values.

- **Motion Description:**
  - The obstacle's motion consistently indicates moving away from the ego car, confirmed by increasing longitudinal distances and decreasing speeds.

- **Risk Assessment:**
  - The obstacle's increasing distance and positive longitudinal velocity indicate a negligible risk scenario.
  - Both TTC and MDC are effectively not applicable under collision risk parameters, suggesting the obstacle poses no risk (score of 5).
