The most recent timestep with both ego and obstacle data is 0.4 seconds.  At this point, the ego vehicle is at (615.9859, -2245.5232) and the obstacle is at (629.0021, -2218.7667). Both are in the same lanelet (184.0). The obstacle is ahead of the ego and slightly to its right.

Looking at the trajectories, both vehicles are moving in roughly the same direction (orientations are similar) and the obstacle is significantly faster than the ego. While the obstacle's braking is more aggressive, the speed differential and proximity suggest a high risk of collision in the near future if this trend continues.  However, at this *exact* moment, it's not a guaranteed collision or extreme risk (score 1) yet.  It's more of a high risk (2) that is quickly escalating. Thus, no obstacles are flagged at level 0 or 1.

    "IsCollisionScenario": false,
    "Reasoning": "At the most recent timestep (0.4s), the obstacle is ahead and to the right of the ego, and closing quickly due to the speed differential. However, a collision isn't inevitable *at this exact moment*. Risk is high (2) but not yet extreme (1)."
