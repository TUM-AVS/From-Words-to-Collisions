The obstacle (ID 30675.0) and ego vehicle (ID 30676.0) are in the same lanelet (184.0).  At t=0.4s, the obstacle is at (629.0021, -2218.7667) while the ego vehicle is at (615.9859, -2245.5232). The obstacle is ahead of the ego vehicle and slightly to its left.  Both are moving in roughly the same direction based on their orientations.  The obstacle's velocity is decreasing faster than the ego vehicle's, but the difference in their positions and velocities suggests a potential collision if these trends continue.  Given the relatively short time horizon provided, it's difficult to definitively say whether the risk is extreme (1) or high (2), but given their proximity and closing speeds, extreme risk (1) is a more appropriate classification.
