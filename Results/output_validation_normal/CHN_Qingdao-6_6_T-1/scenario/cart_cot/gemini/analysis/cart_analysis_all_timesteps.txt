### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 30675.0
- Distance Risk reason: At the last timestep (0.9s), the obstacle is approximately 14 meters ahead of the ego vehicle in the same lanelet.  While the obstacle's x-coordinate is greater, both are moving in the positive x direction with the obstacle moving faster.  Over the observed time, the distance between the ego vehicle and the obstacle has decreased.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason:  The obstacle is moving faster than the ego vehicle, and while both are decelerating, the obstacle's deceleration is greater.  This means the gap between them is closing. Extrapolating the current trajectories, a collision is possible in the near future. 
- Time safety score: 2
- Overall Risk score: 2

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. **Identify the most critical obstacles:** Obstacle 30675.0 is the most critical obstacle as it's in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle and relatively close.
2. **Analyze their trajectories over all 10 timesteps:** Both the ego vehicle and obstacle 30675.0 are moving in a roughly straight path along the positive x-axis. The obstacle is ahead of the ego vehicle and initially moving faster. Both are decelerating, with the obstacle decelerating more rapidly.
3. **Evaluate relative positions, velocities, and accelerations:** The obstacle's initial position is ahead and to the right of the ego vehicle. The gap between the obstacle and ego has decreased at every timestep since 0.1 seconds. The obstacle's velocity is initially higher than the ego's but is decreasing more rapidly.
4. **Determine if any collision has occurred or is imminent:** At the most recent timestep a collision hasn't occurred. However, given the closing distance and relative velocities, a collision is likely if the current trends continue.
5. **Explain your reasoning for your conclusion:** The consistent decrease in distance between the ego vehicle and obstacle 30675.0, combined with their relative velocities and accelerations, suggest that a collision is highly possible if the observed dynamics persist.  While not imminent at 0.9 seconds, the risk is high in the near future.

        "IsCollisionScenario": false,
        "Reasoning": "While a collision hasn't occurred yet at 0.9 seconds, the continuous decrease in distance between the ego vehicle and obstacle 30675.0, along with their relative velocities and accelerations, indicate a high probability of a collision in the near future if the current trends persist. Therefore, the overall risk is considered high (2) but is not scored as an immediate collision risk at 0.9 seconds."
