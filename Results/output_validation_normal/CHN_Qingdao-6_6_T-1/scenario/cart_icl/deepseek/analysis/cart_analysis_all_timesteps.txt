### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep:

### Obstacle Analysis:
- **Obstacle ID**: 30675.0  
  - **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is in the same lanelet (184.0) as the ego vehicle. Over the timesteps, the obstacle has been moving ahead of the ego vehicle but at a decreasing velocity (from 30.0733 to 28.1268 m/s). The distance between the ego and obstacle is increasing over time (from ~28.3m at 0.1s to ~35.5m at 0.4s), indicating the obstacle is moving away.  
  - **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)  
  - **Time Risk reason**: The relative velocity (obstacle velocity - ego velocity) is positive but decreasing (from ~4.2 m/s at 0.1s to ~3.3 m/s at 0.4s). The obstacle is decelerating faster than the ego (-6.4884 vs. -2.1672 m/sÂ² at 0.9s). TTC is increasing, indicating reduced collision risk.  
  - **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)  
  - **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low Risk)  

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. **Lanelet Check**: Both ego and obstacle are in lanelet 184.0, so they share a trajectory.  
2. **Position Trend**: The obstacle is ahead of the ego, and the distance is increasing over time.  
3. **Velocity Trend**: The obstacle is decelerating faster than the ego, reducing relative velocity.  
4. **Collision Risk**: No imminent collision (TTC increasing, distance increasing).
