### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 30672.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is far from ego vehicle and moving away laterally.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason:  Relative velocity and acceleration not indicating a collision course.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 30673.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is far from ego vehicle.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Relative velocity and acceleration not indicating a collision course.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 30674.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is far from ego vehicle.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Relative velocity and acceleration not indicating a collision course.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 30675.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is in the same lane and approaching the ego vehicle, but sufficient longitudinal separation remains.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason:  Ego vehicle decelerating faster than obstacle, reducing collision risk.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- Obstacle ID: 30677.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is far from ego vehicle.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Relative velocity and acceleration not indicating a collision course.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5


### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
This is not a collision scenario. No obstacle has a risk score of 0, and obstacle 30675, while in the same lane and approaching, still maintains a safe distance and relative velocity/acceleration from the ego vehicle over the analyzed period.

### Summary in JSON Format:
