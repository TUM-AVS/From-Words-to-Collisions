### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: 

### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 30672**
  - **Distance Risk reason:** The obstacle is located in a different lanelet from the ego vehicle and the trajectory over the past timesteps shows separation. Thus, negligible lateral distance risk.
  - **Distance safety score:** 5
  - **Time Risk reason:** Velocity and acceleration indicate it is not converging rapidly towards the ego vehicle. The orientation and relative trajectory further confirm minimal risk.
  - **Time safety score:** 5
  - **Overall Risk score:** 5

- **Obstacle ID: 30673**
  - **Distance Risk reason:** Different lanelet without convergence trend indicates low risk of collision. Past positions further support this.
  - **Distance safety score:** 5
  - **Time Risk reason:** Decreasing velocity and the path do not show evidence of colliding trajectory with the ego vehicle.
  - **Time safety score:** 5
  - **Overall Risk score:** 5

- **Obstacle ID: 30674**
  - **Distance Risk reason:** Maintains considerable lateral distance and is positioned in a non-converging lanelet.
  - **Distance safety score:** 5
  - **Time Risk reason:** Orientation and deceleration indicate movement away from the ego vehicleâ€™s path.
  - **Time safety score:** 5
  - **Overall Risk score:** 5

- **Obstacle ID: 30675**
  - **Distance Risk reason:** Present in the same lanelet and is the closest to the ego vehicle, but historical trajectory separates over time.
  - **Distance safety score:** 4
  - **Time Risk reason:** High negative acceleration suggests reducing velocity and steering away from collision.
  - **Time safety score:** 4
  - **Overall Risk score:** 4

- **Obstacle ID: 30677**
  - **Distance Risk reason:** Positioned in a different lanelet with no observed convergence towards the ego vehicle.
  - **Distance safety score:** 5
  - **Time Risk reason:** The velocity and acceleration patterns indicate continued separation from the ego vehicle's path.
  - **Time safety score:** 5
  - **Overall Risk score:** 5

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:

Based on the analysis, no obstacles present in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle are on a converging trajectory that would lead to a collision. Most obstacles are either moving away or situated in different lanelets. The velocity decrease and position shift over time support a negligible to low-risk evaluation for potential collision as of the most recent timestep. The overall scenario is safe without collision risks.
