The obstacle 30675 is moving away from the ego vehicle longitudinally in the most recent timesteps provided.  While there is some lateral relative velocity, it's small and the lateral acceleration suggests this is also decreasing.  Given the increasing longitudinal distance and moderate relative velocity, the risk of collision is low.
