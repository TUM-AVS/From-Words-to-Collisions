The most recent timestep with data is at 0.4 seconds. Obstacle 30675 is moving away longitudinally from the ego vehicle with a relative longitudinal velocity of 3.27 m/s and increasing distance (25.25m). While there is some lateral movement (0.26 m/s), it's not indicative of an immediate collision risk given the current longitudinal motion.  The relative longitudinal acceleration is negative, suggesting the obstacle is decelerating or the ego vehicle is accelerating. Overall, the current situation with Obstacle 30675 doesn't present an immediate collision risk.


**Risk Levels and Definitions:**
<Collision (Score: 0)>: Actual collision has occurred or is unavoidable within the next timestep.
<Extreme Risk (Score: 1)>: Immediate collision or very high likelihood of impact. Urgent action is required.
<High Risk (Score: 2)>: Close to collision or highly probable collision path. Needs prompt attention and quick manoeuvring.
<Medium Risk (Score: 3)>: Moderate collision risk but manageable with timely reactions and proper strategies.
<Low Risk (Score: 4)>: Minimal collision risk. The situation is controllable with sufficient time to react.
<Negligible Risk (Score: 5)>: No significant collision risk. Obstacles are either moving away or far enough not to interfere.
