### Safety analysis for timestep 0.9 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
The provided scenario context ends at 0.4 seconds.  There is no data available for 0.5 to 0.9 seconds. Therefore, I'll analyze the latest available timestep, which is 0.4 seconds.

### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 30675
- Distance Risk reason:  At 0.4 seconds, Obstacle 30675 is 25.25m longitudinally and laterally away from the ego vehicle. It is located in the front.  The obstacle is moving away longitudinally, increasing the distance. This distance suggests no immediate risk.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Since the obstacle is moving away from the ego vehicle, the TTC is theoretically infinite.  There is no risk of collision based on current movement.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
