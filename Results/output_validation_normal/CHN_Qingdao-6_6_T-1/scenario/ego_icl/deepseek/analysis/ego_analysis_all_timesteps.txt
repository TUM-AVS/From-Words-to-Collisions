### Obstacle-by-Obstacle Analysis

#### Obstacle 30675 (Front of ego car)
- **Most Recent Timestep (0.4 seconds)**:
  - **Adjusted Distances**: 
    - Longitudinal: 25.25 m (raw distance provided, adjusted distance assumed same due to lack of explicit adjusted values)
    - Lateral: 0.00 m (exact alignment)
  - **Relative Velocity**: 
    - Longitudinal: 3.27 m/s (positive, but motion description says obstacle is moving away longitudinally)
    - Lateral: 0.26 m/s (positive, slight lateral movement)
  - **Relative Acceleration**:
    - Longitudinal: -1.64 m/s² (decelerating)
    - Lateral: -3.47 m/s² (decelerating)
  - **Motion Description**: Obstacle is moving away longitudinally. Exact lateral alignment.

- **Trajectory Analysis**:
  - Across timesteps (0.1s to 0.4s), the longitudinal distance increases from 24.25 m to 25.25 m, confirming the obstacle is moving away.
  - Lateral distance remains 0.00 m, but lateral velocity is very low (0.26 m/s) and decelerating (-3.47 m/s²), indicating minimal lateral movement.

- **Time-to-Collision (TTC)**:
  - Longitudinal: Not applicable (obstacle is moving away, relative velocity is positive but motion description contradicts this; likely a sign error in velocity).
  - Lateral: TTC = 0.00 m / 0.26 m/s = 0.00 s (but since lateral distance is stable/increasing, no collision risk).

- **Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC)**:
  - Lateral: 0.00 m (but trajectories are not converging; obstacle is moving away longitudinally and laterally stable).
  - Longitudinal: Increasing distance, so MDC is not applicable for collision.

- **Risk Assessment**:
  - **Longitudinal**: No Risk (5) - Distance increasing.
  - **Lateral**: No Risk (5) - Distance stable/increasing.
  - **Overall Risk**: No Risk (5) - No converging trajectories.

### Key Observations:
1. The obstacle is moving away from the ego vehicle longitudinally (distance increasing from 24.25 m to 25.25 m over 0.4 seconds).
2. Lateral distance is 0.00 m but stable (very low lateral velocity and decelerating).
3. No converging trajectories or imminent collision risks.
4. This is **not** a collision scenario.
