Obstacle 30675 Analysis:

Trajectory Analysis: Across the provided timesteps (0.0s to 0.9s), obstacle 30675 consistently remains in front of the ego vehicle and laterally aligned (lateral distance = 0.00m). The longitudinal distance is increasing, indicating the obstacle is moving away from the ego vehicle.

TTC Calculation: Since the obstacle is moving away longitudinally, a positive TTC value doesn't apply in the longitudinal direction.  Laterally, the small relative velocity and fixed 0.00m lateral distance make a traditional TTC calculation less meaningful.

MDC Calculation: Given the continuous lateral alignment and increasing longitudinal distance, the MDC is effectively the lateral distance, which remains at 0.00m.  However, because the obstacle is moving *away* longitudinally, this alignment does not represent a collision risk.

Risk Assessment:
* Longitudinal Risk: No Risk (5) - Obstacle is moving away from the ego vehicle.
* Lateral Risk: No Risk (5) - Although laterally aligned, the obstacle is moving away longitudinally, eliminating immediate lateral collision risk.

Overall Risk: No Risk (5)

Collision Scenario Determination:

This is NOT a collision scenario. No obstacle exhibits a risk score of 0 (collision) or 1 (extreme risk).
