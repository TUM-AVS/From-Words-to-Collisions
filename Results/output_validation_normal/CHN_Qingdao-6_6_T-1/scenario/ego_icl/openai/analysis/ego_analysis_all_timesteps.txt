### Obstacle Analysis

#### Obstacle ID: 30675

**Trajectory Analysis Across Timesteps:**
- **At 0.1 seconds:** Longitudinal distance = 24.25 m, Relative velocity = 4.33 m/s (moving away), Relative acceleration = -2.31 m/sÂ²
- **At 0.2 seconds:** Longitudinal distance = 24.63 m, Relative velocity = 3.89 m/s (moving away)
- **At 0.3 seconds:** Longitudinal distance = 24.96 m, Relative velocity = 3.47 m/s (moving away)
- **At 0.4 seconds:** Longitudinal distance = 25.25 m, Relative velocity = 3.27 m/s (moving away)

**Observation:**
- The obstacle is consistently moving away from the ego vehicle with the longitudinal distance increasing over time. 
- The relative longitudinal velocity is decreasing in magnitude, indicating that the rate at which the obstacle moves away is reducing. However, it is still moving away.

**Risk Assessment (Most Recent Timestep):**

1. **Time-to-Collision (TTC) Calculation:**
   - Longitudinal Distance = 25.25 m
   - Longitudinal Relative Velocity = 3.27 m/s (positive, moving away)
   - Since the obstacle is moving away, TTC is not a concern for collision, thus TTC does not apply for calculating collision risk.
   
2. **Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC) Calculation:** 
   - The obstacle remains directly in front with a longitudinal alignment, and its lateral position remains at 0.00m 
   - Given moving away trend and distance,
     - MDC is effectively the current adjusted longitudinal distance as the obstacle moves away.
     - Assuming minimal lateral change,
     - MDC > 5 meters.

3. **Risk Score Determination:**
   - **Proximity:** Current distance > 25m and increasing
   - **MDC:** > 5.0 meters
   - **Risk Score:** No Risk (5)

### Conclusion

Given that Obstacle 30675 is consistently moving away from the ego vehicle with increasing distance, there is no immediate risk of collision. Thus, this scenario is not a collision scenario.
