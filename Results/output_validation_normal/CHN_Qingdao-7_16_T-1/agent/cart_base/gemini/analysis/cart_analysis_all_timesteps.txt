The ego vehicle and obstacle 30654.0 are in the same lanelet (447.0).  The obstacle's initial velocity is higher than the ego vehicle's, but it's decelerating significantly while the ego vehicle initially accelerates slightly before decelerating.  The longitudinal distance between them is decreasing over time.  While the provided data doesn't give explicit distances, calculating the distance between their positions shows a decreasing trend, suggesting a potential collision risk.  

By timestep 0.9 seconds, the obstacle is still ahead of the ego vehicle, but the gap has closed considerably.  Without more future timesteps, it's difficult to definitively say a collision is certain, but the trend clearly indicates an increasing risk, at least to a "High Risk" level.
