At t=0.9s, the ego vehicle is at (20.7462, -2391.1137) with a velocity of 13.0847 and the obstacle 30654.0 is at (35.3925, -2382.3608) with a velocity of 11.8302. Both are in the same lanelet (447.0).

**Analysis and Calculations:**

1. **Longitudinal TTC:** The obstacle is ahead of the ego vehicle in the x-direction. The relative longitudinal velocity is 11.8302 - 13.0847 = -1.2545 (ego is faster).  The longitudinal distance is 35.3925 - 20.7462 = 14.6463.  Thus, the longitudinal TTC is 14.6463 / 1.2545 ≈ 11.67 seconds. This suggests no immediate longitudinal collision risk.

2. **Lateral TTC:**  The lateral distance is |-2382.3608 - (-2391.1137)| = 8.7529. Since both vehicles are in the same lane and their orientations are similar (though not identical), we can assume minimal lateral movement relative to each other unless a lane change occurs.  Given their current trajectories and the fact they remain within the same lanelet, immediate lateral collision risk is low.

3. **MDC (Minimum Distance between Centers):** The distance between the ego and obstacle at t=0.9s is sqrt((14.6463)^2 + (8.7529)^2) ≈ 17.07 meters.


**Reasoning:**

While the ego vehicle is approaching the obstacle from behind, the TTC calculations, combined with the MDC, suggest a low risk of collision in the immediate future (next few seconds).  The significant longitudinal TTC and relatively large lateral separation indicate that even if the ego vehicle maintains its current speed, collision is unlikely without a significant change in either vehicle's trajectory. The obstacle's deceleration might even further decrease collision risk in the near future.  However, continuous monitoring is necessary to account for unexpected maneuvers. Due to both being in the same lanelet and maintaining their current path, even though the ego vehicle is moving at a greater speed, there is enough space/time for corrective action to be taken to prevent a collision.  


**Risk Assessment:**

Given the analysis, the following risk scores are assigned:

* **Overall Risk Score for obstacle 30654.0:** 4 (Low Risk) -  Sufficient time and distance exist for the ego vehicle to react and avoid collision.
