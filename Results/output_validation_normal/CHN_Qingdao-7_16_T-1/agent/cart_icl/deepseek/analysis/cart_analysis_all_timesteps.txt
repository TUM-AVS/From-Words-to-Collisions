### Analysis:

1. **Obstacle 30654 (Most Recent Timestep at 0.9s):**
   - **Relative Position**: Ego is at (20.7462, -2391.1137), obstacle is at (35.3925, -2382.3608). The lateral distance is significant (~8.75m), and the longitudinal distance is ~14.65m.
   - **Relative Velocity**: Ego velocity is 13.0847 m/s, obstacle velocity is 11.8302 m/s (approaching but decelerating at -3.5737 m/s²). The relative velocity is ~1.2545 m/s (ego is faster).
   - **TTC**: Longitudinal distance / relative velocity = 14.65 / 1.2545 ≈ 11.68s (high TTC, low immediate risk).
   - **MDC**: The lateral distance (~8.75m) is large, and the obstacle is ahead but decelerating. No immediate collision risk.
   - **Overall Risk**: Low risk due to high TTC and large lateral distance. The obstacle is decelerating, and the ego is also decelerating slightly.

2. **Motion Trends (Earlier Timesteps):**
   - The ego and obstacle are in the same lanelet (447.0), but the lateral distance remains large (~8-9m), indicating they are not on a direct collision course.
   - The obstacle is decelerating more aggressively than the ego, which further reduces the risk of collision.

### Conclusion:
- No collision or extreme risk is detected. The obstacle is ahead and decelerating, with a large lateral distance and high TTC.
- The overall risk is **Low (4)** for the obstacle, as there is sufficient time and space to react.
