At t=0.9s, the ego vehicle at (20.7462, -2391.1137) is moving with a velocity of 13.0847 and accelerating at -0.4773. The obstacle (ID: 30654) is at (35.3925, -2382.3608), moving with velocity 11.8302 and accelerating at -3.5737.

The lateral distance between the ego and the obstacle is approximately 8.75m. The longitudinal distance is 14.6463m.  The obstacle is ahead of the ego vehicle and in the same lanelet (447). The relative velocity is 13.0847 - 11.8302 = 1.2545 m/s (ego is faster).  A simple TTC calculation (using just longitudinal distance and speeds), yields  14.6463 / 1.2545 = 11.67 seconds. However, given the lateral separation and the fact that both vehicles are moving forward with similar speeds, a collision is improbable. Both ego and obstacle are decelerating, but the obstacle's deceleration is much stronger which will further lower the risk. Therefore, we categorize this situation with a low risk despite sharing the same lane.
