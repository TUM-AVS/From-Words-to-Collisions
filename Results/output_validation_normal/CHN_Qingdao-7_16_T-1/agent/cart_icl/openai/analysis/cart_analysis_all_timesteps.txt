To analyze the collision risk in this scenario:

### Analysis of Scenario at 0.9 seconds:
**Ego Vehicle:**
- Position: (20.7462, -2391.1137)
- Orientation: 0.5185
- Velocity: 13.0847 m/s
- Acceleration: -0.4773 m/s²

**Obstacle 30654.0:**
- Position: (35.3925, -2382.3608)
- Orientation: 0.5477
- Velocity: 11.8302 m/s
- Acceleration: -3.5737 m/s²

### Trajectory and Motion Analysis:
- **Relative Motion**:
  - Longitudinal position difference: Approximately 14.65 m (obstacle is ahead of the ego vehicle)
  - Ego vehicle has a slightly higher velocity (13.08 m/s) compared to the obstacle (11.83 m/s), indicating the ego vehicle is closing in on the obstacle
  - The relative longitudinal velocity (approx. 1.25 m/s) suggests the ego is catching up to the obstacle.

- **Lateral Distance**:
  - Y-coordinate offset is small, indicating close lateral proximity on the lanelet (both in lanelet 447.0).

### Time to Collision (TTC) and Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC):
- **TTC Calculation**:
  - Relative longitudinal position: 14.65 m
  - Relative longitudinal velocity: 1.25 m/s (ego is slightly faster, closing in)
  - TTC = 14.65 / 1.25 = 11.72 seconds

- **Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC)**:
  - With the given trajectory, the distance between the vehicles is almost linear with time.
  - The MDC is the current distance given slow relative closing speed.

### Risk Assessment:
- **TTC and MDC indicate no immediate risk since the calculated TTC is sufficiently high (11.72 seconds) and the vehicles are in the same lane but not in close proximity.**
- Both Ego and obstacle are moving safely with respect to each other with no abrupt changes in velocity and orientation.

### Conclusion:
- The situation poses no immediate collision risk as both vehicles generally maintain consistent dynamic states, with ample TTC and manageable MDC, given their controlled slowing down and alignment.
