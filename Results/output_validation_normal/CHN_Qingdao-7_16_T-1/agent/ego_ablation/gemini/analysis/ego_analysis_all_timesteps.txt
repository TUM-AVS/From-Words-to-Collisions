At t=0.9s, obstacle 30654 is moving towards the ego vehicle longitudinally at -1.26 m/s and slightly away laterally at 0.35 m/s.  The longitudinal distance is decreasing, but it is still at a safe distance (12.55m). The lateral movement, while slightly away from the ego, is minimal and with the uncertainty inherent in predictions, does not guarantee avoidance. Given the current distance, relative velocity, and the short prediction horizon, the risk is assessed as medium.
