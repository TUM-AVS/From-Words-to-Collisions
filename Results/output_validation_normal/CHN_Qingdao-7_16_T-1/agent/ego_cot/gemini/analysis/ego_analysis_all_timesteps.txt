### Safety analysis for timestep 0.9s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:
- **Obstacle ID:** 30654
- **Distance Risk reason:** At 0.9 seconds, the obstacle is 12.55 meters longitudinally and laterally away from the ego vehicle, positioned in front. This distance is significant, suggesting no immediate risk.
- **Distance safety score:** 5
- **Time Risk reason:** While the obstacle's longitudinal velocity is negative (-1.26 m/s), indicating movement towards the ego vehicle, the substantial distance and relatively slow speed suggest ample time to react. Additionally, the slight positive lateral velocity (0.35 m/s) indicates a diverging lateral trajectory.
- **Time safety score:** 4
- **Overall Risk score:** 4
