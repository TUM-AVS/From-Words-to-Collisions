### Obstacle Analysis: 30654

#### Trajectory Analysis:
- **0.0s to 0.9s**: Obstacle 30654 starts in the front-right of the ego car and gradually moves to the front, aligning laterally with the ego car by 0.3s. The longitudinal distance initially increases slightly (from 12.71m to 12.94m) but then decreases (to 12.55m at 0.9s). The lateral distance decreases from -0.40m to 0.00m, indicating the obstacle is moving toward the ego car's lane.

#### Most Recent Timestep (0.9s):
- **Position**: Front of the ego car (longitudinal = 12.55m, lateral = 0.00m).
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal = -1.26 m/s (approaching), Lateral = 0.35 m/s (moving away).
- **Motion Description**: "Obstacle is driving toward the ego car longitudinally. Exact lateral alignment or unknown case."

#### Risk Assessment:
1. **Longitudinal Risk**:
   - **Distance**: 12.55m (adjusted).
   - **Relative Velocity**: -1.26 m/s (closing).
   - **TTC**: 12.55 / 1.26 â‰ˆ 9.96s (No Risk, TTC > 5.0s).
   - **MDC**: 12.55m (No Risk, MDC > 5.0m).

2. **Lateral Risk**:
   - **Distance**: 0.00m (aligned).
   - **Relative Velocity**: 0.35 m/s (moving away).
   - **TTC**: Not applicable (moving apart).
   - **MDC**: 0.00m (but moving away, so no collision risk).

3. **Overall Risk**:
   - The obstacle is longitudinally approaching but at a safe distance and time-to-collision. Laterally, it is aligned but moving away, so no risk of collision.
   - **Overall Risk Score**: 5 (Negligible Risk).
