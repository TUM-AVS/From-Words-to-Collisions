Obstacle 30654 Analysis:

Trajectory Analysis:
- Initially, the obstacle is in the front-right of the ego vehicle and moving away both longitudinally and laterally.
- Over the timesteps, the lateral distance decreases to 0, indicating alignment in the same lane.
- The longitudinal distance initially increases slightly but then starts decreasing, with the obstacle's longitudinal velocity turning negative (towards the ego vehicle).

Most Recent Timestep (0.9 seconds):
- Longitudinal distance: 12.55 m
- Lateral distance: 0.00 m
- Longitudinal relative velocity: -1.26 m/s (approaching)
- Lateral relative velocity: 0.35 m/s (moving left relative to ego)

TTC Calculation:
- Longitudinal TTC = 12.55 m / 1.26 m/s = 9.96 s
- Lateral TTC (not meaningful since lateral distance is zero and the obstacle is moving away laterally to the left and is in front of the ego vehicle)


MDC Calculation:
- Since the obstacle is directly in front (lateral distance = 0), MDC is primarily determined by the longitudinal distance.
- MDC â‰ˆ 12.55 m

Risk Assessment:
- Longitudinal distance is significant, and TTC is high, indicating low longitudinal risk.
- Lateral distance is zero, indicating the obstacle is aligned with the ego-vehicle's lane center. Lateral velocity is positive, implying further motion to the left relative to ego.  Due to exact lateral alignment, but substantial longitudinal distance and safe TTC, the risk here is considered Low (4).


Overall Risk: Low (4).  While the obstacle is exactly aligned, the high longitudinal distance and safe TTC suggest there's no immediate danger.
