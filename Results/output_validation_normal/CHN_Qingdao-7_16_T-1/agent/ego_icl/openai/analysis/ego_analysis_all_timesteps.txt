### Obstacle Analysis

#### Obstacle ID: 30654
**Trajectory and Motion Analysis:**
- Over the recorded time (0.1s to 0.9s), the obstacle has been consistently in front or front-right of the ego vehicle, aligning closely longitudinally but moving laterally towards alignment with an eventual exact positioning at the latest timestep.
- Longitudinally, the distance has slightly decreased from 12.71m to 12.55m, with the obstacle moving towards the ego vehicle as a decreasing trend in distance is observed, accompanied by a shift in relative velocity from positive to negative (e.g., -1.26 m/s longitudinally at 0.9s indicates closing in).
- Laterally, the obstacle started at -0.40m (slight right) and moved to 0.00m (exact alignment), showing a consistent pathway to alignment over the timeline.

**Latest Timestep (0.9s):**
- **Adjusted Longitudinal Distance:** 12.55m
- **Adjusted Lateral Distance:** 0.00m

The motion description indicates the obstacle is driving toward the ego car longitudinally, which means there is closing velocity.

**Calculations:**
- **MDC (Minimum Distance to Collision):** The adjusted longitudinal distance of 12.55m indicates a significant buffer, and given the lateral alignment, we focus on longitudinal MDC, which is still 12.55m. Given the current movement (closing), it suggests monitoring but isn't immediately alarming.
- **TTC (Time-to-Collision):** Since the lateral distance becomes 0.00m (alignment), the longitudinal is the critical measure. At 12.55m distance and -1.26 m/s velocity:
  - TTC (longitudinal) = 12.55m / 1.26 m/s â‰ˆ 9.96 seconds

**Risk Assessment:**
- With a TTC of approximately 9.96 seconds, this falls into the "No Risk" category for collision based on distance-time projecting beyond a minimal 5-second threshold.
- The consistent declining movement and alignment improvements suggest no imminent collision.

### Conclusion:
The obstacle remains a low risk due to the significant alignment longitudinally and adequately large TTC.
