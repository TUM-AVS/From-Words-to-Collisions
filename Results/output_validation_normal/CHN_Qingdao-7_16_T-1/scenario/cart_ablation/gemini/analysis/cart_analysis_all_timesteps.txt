At t=0.9s, the ego vehicle is at (20.7462, -2391.1137) and the obstacle is at (35.3925, -2382.3608). Both are in the same lanelet (447.0). While the obstacle's x-coordinate is significantly ahead of the ego vehicle's, the y-coordinates are relatively close, suggesting potential lateral proximity. However, the provided data lacks information about vehicle dimensions and lane width.  Furthermore, the obstacle's velocity is decreasing, while the ego vehicle's velocity is also decreasing, reducing the risk of a collision.  Based on the trajectory and deceleration, the risk is assessed as low.
