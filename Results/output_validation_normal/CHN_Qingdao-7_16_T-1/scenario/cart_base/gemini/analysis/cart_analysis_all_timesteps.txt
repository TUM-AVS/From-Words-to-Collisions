At t=0.9s, the ego vehicle is at (20.7462, -2391.1137) and the obstacle (ID 30654.0) is at (35.3925, -2382.3608). While the obstacle is ahead of the ego vehicle in the x-direction (longitudinal), the y-coordinates (lateral) indicate they are in relatively close proximity.  The obstacle's velocity is decreasing but it is still considerable. Based on the trajectories, the risk of collision is not immediate but requires attention. Given the rate of deceleration of the obstacle and the lateral proximity, the risk is categorized as medium (3).  Therefore no immediate or extreme risk.
