### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:
- **Obstacle ID**: 30654.0  
  - **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is in the same lanelet (447.0) as the ego vehicle. Over the past timesteps, the distance between the ego and the obstacle has been decreasing, but the obstacle is still ~14.6 units ahead (longitudinal distance) and laterally aligned (similar Y-coordinates).  
  - **Distance safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk)  
  - **Time Risk reason**: The obstacle is decelerating (negative acceleration) while the ego is maintaining a steady speed. The relative velocity is decreasing, and the TTC is increasing, indicating reduced collision risk.  
  - **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)  
  - **Overall Risk score**: 3 (Medium Risk)  

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. **Same Lanelet**: Both ego and obstacle are in lanelet 447.0, indicating shared trajectory.  
2. **Distance Trend**: The obstacle is ahead but the distance is decreasing slowly.  
3. **Velocity/Acceleration**: Obstacle is decelerating significantly, while ego maintains near-constant speed. This reduces collision risk over time.  
4. **TTC**: Increasing due to obstacle's deceleration.  
5. **Conclusion**: No immediate collision risk, but monitoring is required due to shared lanelet.
