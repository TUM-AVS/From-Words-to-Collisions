### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
Based on the trajectories and distances of all obstacles at the most recent timestep (0.9s), there are no imminent collisions. Though some obstacles are relatively close laterally, their movement patterns suggest they are diverging from the ego vehicle's path.  Therefore, this is not a collision scenario.


### Summary in JSON Format: 
```json
{
  "CollisionObstacles": [],
  "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null,
  "ScenarioAnalysis": {
    "IsCollisionScenario": false,
    "Reasoning": "No obstacle presents an immediate collision risk at the most recent timestep.  Lateral distances are safe, and the observed trajectories indicate diverging paths."
