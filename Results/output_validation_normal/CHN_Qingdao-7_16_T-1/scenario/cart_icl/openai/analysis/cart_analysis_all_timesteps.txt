### Obstacle Analysis:

1. **Obstacle ID: 30650**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Obstacle is stationary in the same lanelet (447.0) as the ego vehicle but at a considerable distance. 
   - **Distance safety score**: 5
   - **Time Risk reason**: Obstacle has been stationary with no relevant velocity or acceleration patterns.
   - **Time safety score**: 5
   - **Overall Risk score**: 5

2. **Obstacle ID: 30651**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Obstacle is in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle, moving away with low velocity, reducing collision risk.
   - **Distance safety score**: 4
   - **Time Risk reason**: Obstacle's velocity is decreasing, further decreasing the risk.
   - **Time safety score**: 4
   - **Overall Risk score**: 4

3. **Obstacle ID: 30649**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Obstacle is in a different lanelet and moving further away.
   - **Distance safety score**: 5
   - **Time Risk reason**: Consistent decrease in relative approach towards the ego vehicle.
   - **Time safety score**: 5
   - **Overall Risk score**: 5

4. **Obstacle ID: 30647**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Very distant initially and continues to move in a different lanelet.
   - **Distance safety score**: 5
   - **Time Risk reason**: No relative approach or collision course observed.
   - **Time safety score**: 5
   - **Overall Risk score**: 5

5. **Obstacle ID: 30668**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Obstacle moving in the same lanelet but not in immediate driving path, velocity and acceleration suggest diverging path.
   - **Distance safety score**: 4
   - **Time Risk reason**: Velocity and acceleration suggest it is not on a collision course. 
   - **Time safety score**: 4
   - **Overall Risk score**: 4

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
- No obstacles are moving directly towards the ego vehicle in a threatening manner in the same lanelet.
- Obstacles in the same lanelet are either stationary or moving away.
- Relative velocities and positions do not indicate any immediate collision scenario.
- Consistently evaluated over the history, no patterns suggest a high or extreme collision risk.
- **Scenario Analysis**: This is not a collision scenario as no obstacle poses a risk of collision.
