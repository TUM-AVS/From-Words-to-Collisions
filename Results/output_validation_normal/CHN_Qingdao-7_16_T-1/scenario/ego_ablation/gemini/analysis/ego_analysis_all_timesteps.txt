Obstacle 30654 is moving closer to the ego vehicle both longitudinally and laterally.  While the lateral movement is slight and away from the direct front, the longitudinal closing velocity is increasing. The distance is still relatively safe at 12.55 meters, but the trend suggests a potential risk in subsequent timesteps if the relative acceleration and velocity continue in the current direction. Although the risk is not immediate, the developing situation warrants close monitoring.
