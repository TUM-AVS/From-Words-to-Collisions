Obstacle 30654 is moving closer to the ego vehicle longitudinally, with a relative longitudinal velocity of -1.26 m/s and a decreasing longitudinal distance of 12.55 meters.  Laterally, the obstacle is very close to the ego vehicle (0.00 m lateral distance) and slightly moving away with a relative lateral velocity of 0.35 m/s.  Although the lateral movement is slightly away, the longitudinal closing velocity suggests a potential collision risk if this trend continues. The decreasing distance combined with closing velocity indicates a high risk.
