### Safety analysis for timestep 0.9 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 30654
- Distance Risk reason: At 0.9 seconds, the obstacle is 12.55m away both longitudinally and laterally, located in front of the ego vehicle. This distance is substantial, suggesting no immediate distance-based risk. However, the obstacle's motion indicates it is moving closer longitudinally while slightly drifting laterally towards the ego vehicle's path.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: While the distance is currently safe, the closing longitudinal velocity (-1.26 m/s) raises concern.  We need to calculate TTC to properly assess this.  Assuming constant velocity (a simplification for this example, more sophisticated analysis would use acceleration), TTClong = distance/velocity = 12.55m / 1.26m/s â‰ˆ 9.96 seconds. While almost 10 seconds seems like a large margin, the negative acceleration indicates that the car is continuing to slow down as it's moving closer to the car. If it continues to slow down over this period, the TTC time will decrease over each time step.  The lateral motion, with a small positive relative velocity (0.35m/s) and ongoing negative acceleration,  suggests the obstacle is adjusting its path but not drastically.  We don't have enough information to accurately calculate a precise TTClat, but the small velocity values relative to the distance suggest ample time.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4


### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
  "CollisionObstacle": null,
  "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null,
  "IsCollisionScenario": false,
  "Justification": "No immediate collision or extreme risk detected at the current timestep (0.9s). Although the obstacle is approaching longitudinally, the TTC and distances suggest sufficient time and space for maneuver.  Continuous monitoring is required due to the dynamics of the situation."
