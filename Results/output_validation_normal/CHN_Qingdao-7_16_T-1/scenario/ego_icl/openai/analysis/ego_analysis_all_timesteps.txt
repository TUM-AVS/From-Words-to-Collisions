### Obstacle 30654 Analysis:

**Trajectory Analysis:**

- Over the progression from 0.0 to 0.9 seconds, the obstacle moves initially away and then begins to move closer to the ego vehicle.
- By 0.9s, the relative longitudinal velocity has increased in a negative direction, indicating the obstacle is closing in longitudinally.
- Lateral movement aligns exactly (0.00m lateral distance), indicating the obstacle is directly in front of the ego vehicle.

**Most Recent Timestep (0.9 seconds):**
- **Position:** Front of Ego Vehicle
- **Adjusted Distances:** Longitudinal 12.55 m, Lateral 0.00 m
- **Relative Velocity:** Longitudinal -1.26 m/s, Lateral 0.35 m/s
- **Motion Description:** Obstacle is driving toward the ego vehicle longitudinally with exact lateral alignment.

**Calculations:**

1. **Time-to-Collision (TTC):**
   - **Longitudinal:** TTC_long = 12.55 / 1.26 ≈ 9.96 seconds
   - **Lateral:** Since the lateral distance is 0.00 m and the relative lateral velocity is moving slightly apart (0.35 m/s away), lateral TTC implies no imminent collision.

2. **Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC):**
   - **Longitudinal MDC:** Approximated based on the current scenario, the MDC longitudinal distance remains 12.55 m given they are still separating laterally and there isn't a closing path considered yet.
   - **Lateral MDC:** 0.00 m due to direct alignment, but viewed against motion and longitudinal distance, no lateral overlap is expected.

**Risk Assessment:**
- **Longitudinal TTC** indicates an additional monitoring need, but not immediate impact (Risk Score: 5 — No Risk).
- **Lateral alignment** indicates Zero distance overlap, but not converging under direct imminent risk scenarios if considered for a constant watching trend. 
- As per both directional calculations, since longitudinal distance is relatively safe and lateral slight separation, primary risk does NOT apply here.

### Conclusion:
Given the calculations detailed above, the overall risk score is determined from the least safe component. However, neither posing immediate lateral nor longitudinal threat:
- **Overall Risk for Obstacle 30654 is 5 (No Risk).**

```json
{
    "CollisionObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "None",
        "OverallRiskScore": "0"
    },
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "None",
        "OverallRiskScore": "1"
    },
    "IsCollisionScenario": false,
    "Justification": "Obstacle 30654 shows safe longitudinal distance with increasing longitudinal separation. Though there's exact lateral alignment, no motion indication or calculated value shows collision path within immediate timestep urgency."
}
```

This scenario does not suggest a collision scenario because the calculated risk parameters don’t breach critical risk zones.
