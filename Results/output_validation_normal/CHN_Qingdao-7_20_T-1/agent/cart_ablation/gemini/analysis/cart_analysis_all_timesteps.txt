The ego vehicle and obstacle 30674.0 are in the same lanelet (453.0).  Analyzing the provided positions, it appears the obstacle is ahead of the ego vehicle and both are moving in roughly the same direction (orientations are similar, though the obstacle seems to be turning more sharply). The obstacle's velocity is decreasing more rapidly than the ego vehicle's, but the distance between them doesn't appear to be closing dramatically enough within the provided timeframe to suggest an immediate collision.  Further data points would be needed to make a definitive assessment. Based on the data, the risk is medium (3), not high enough to warrant 1 or 2 in the JSON output.
