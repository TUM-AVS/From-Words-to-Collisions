At t=0.9s, the ego vehicle is at (79.9583, -2397.281) with a velocity of 11.4162 and the obstacle 30674.0 is at (91.3393, -2379.413) with velocity 6.1977.  Both are in the same lanelet (453.0).

**Analysis and Calculations:**

1. **Lateral Distance:** The lateral distance is approximately |(-2379.413) - (-2397.281)| = 17.868 meters. This is a significant lateral separation.

2. **Longitudinal Distance:** The longitudinal distance is approximately |91.3393 - 79.9583| = 11.381 meters.

3. **Relative Velocity:**  The obstacle's longitudinal velocity is significantly lower than the ego vehicle's.  Since they are in the same lanelet and the lateral distance is non-negligible, we can assume that the vehicles are traveling in roughly the same direction (same sign for longitudinal velocity). The relative longitudinal velocity is then approximately 11.4162 - 6.1977 = 5.2185 m/s. Note: A more precise analysis might factor in the slightly different orientations, but the provided data shows that the difference is small enough to consider their movements mostly parallel for this rough TTC estimation.


4. **Approximate TTC (Longitudinal):**  TTC ≈ Longitudinal Distance / Relative Longitudinal Velocity ≈ 11.381 / 5.2185 ≈ 2.18 seconds.


5. **Overall Risk Assessment:**

* **Position:**  The vehicles are separated longitudinally and laterally.
* **Velocity:** The relative velocity is moderate.
* **TTC:** The calculated TTC of ~2.18 seconds suggests that the ego has sufficient time to react to the slower obstacle.
* **MDC**: Minimal distance won't happen immediately due to lateral separation and different velocities, a more detailed analysis of future trajectories would be required to calculate an accurate MDC.
* **Orientation:**  The slight differences in orientation between vehicles based on the provided data are not immediately concerning given the other factors.


Given the calculated TTC, the lateral separation, and the difference in velocities, the risk of collision is low.  We will categorize this as *Low Risk (4)*.
