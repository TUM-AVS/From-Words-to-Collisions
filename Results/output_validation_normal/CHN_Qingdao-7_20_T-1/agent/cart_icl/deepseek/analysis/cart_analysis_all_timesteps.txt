### Analysis:

1. **Ego Vehicle (30677.0)**:  
   - Position at 0.9s: (79.9583, -2397.281)  
   - Velocity: 11.4162 m/s (decelerating slightly)  
   - Orientation: 0.6707 radians (~38.4 degrees)  

2. **Obstacle (30674.0)**:  
   - Position at 0.9s: (91.3393, -2379.413)  
   - Velocity: 6.1977 m/s (decelerating)  
   - Orientation: 1.5905 radians (~91.1 degrees)  

#### Relative Motion and Risk Assessment:
- **Relative Position**:  
  - Longitudinal distance: ~11.38 m (obstacle ahead)  
  - Lateral distance: ~17.87 m (obstacle to the left)  

- **Relative Velocity**:  
  - Ego is moving faster than the obstacle (11.4162 m/s vs. 6.1977 m/s).  
  - Closing speed: ~5.22 m/s  

- **Time to Collision (TTC)**:  
  - TTC = Longitudinal distance / Relative velocity = 11.38 / 5.22 â‰ˆ 2.18 s  
  - This suggests a **medium risk** (TTC > 2s but < 5s).  

- **Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC)**:  
  - The lateral distance is large (~17.87 m), so the paths are not converging.  
  - No immediate risk of collision.  

#### Risk Score:  
- **Overall Risk Score**: 4 (Low Risk)  
  - The obstacle is ahead but at a significant lateral distance.  
  - The TTC is manageable, and the paths are not converging.
