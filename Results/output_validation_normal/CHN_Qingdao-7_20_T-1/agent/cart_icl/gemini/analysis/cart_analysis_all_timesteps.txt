At t=0.9s, the ego vehicle is at (79.9583, -2397.281) with a velocity of 11.4162 m/s and the obstacle (ID: 30674) is at (91.3393, -2379.413) with a velocity of 6.1977 m/s.  Both are in the same lanelet (453).

The obstacle is ahead of the ego vehicle and slightly to its right.  Let's approximate the relative positions and velocities:

* Longitudinal distance: 91.3393 - 79.9583 = 11.381m
* Lateral distance: |-2379.413 - (-2397.281)| = 17.868m
* Longitudinal relative velocity: 6.1977 - 11.4162 = -5.2185 m/s (ego is faster)
* Approximate TTC: 11.381 / 5.2185 â‰ˆ 2.18 seconds.

While the lateral distance is significant, the vehicles are in the same lanelet. The ego vehicle is approaching the obstacle rapidly, as evidenced by the negative relative velocity and the TTC of ~2.18 seconds. This warrants a closer look but doesn't immediately signal an extreme risk.  Given the data provided, it's difficult to precisely determine the MDC without detailed vehicle dimensions and the lanelet width.  However, considering the closing speed and same lanelet occupancy, a medium risk assessment is appropriate. The obstacle's deceleration trend also somewhat mitigates the risk.
