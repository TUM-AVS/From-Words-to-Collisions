### Detailed Evaluation:

**Trajectory Overview:**

1. **Ego Vehicle Observation at 0.9s:**
   - Position: (79.9583, -2397.281)
   - Orientation: 0.6707 radians
   - Velocity: 11.4162 m/s
   - Acceleration: -0.2997 m/s²

2. **Obstacle (ID: 30674.0) Observation at 0.9s:**
   - Position: (91.3393, -2379.413)
   - Orientation: 1.5905 radians
   - Velocity: 6.1977 m/s
   - Acceleration: -2.9122 m/s²

**Relative Motion Analysis:**

- **Relative Position Analysis:**
  - Longitudinal distance: √((91.3393 - 79.9583)² + (-2379.413 + 2397.281)²) ≈ 20.33 meters
  - Obstacle is ahead of the ego vehicle in the same lanelet.

- **Relative Velocity:**
  - Ego is moving faster than the obstacle despite both vehicles decelerating. The relative longitudinal velocity is approximately 11.4162 - 6.1977 = 5.2185 m/s towards the obstacle.

**TTC and MDC Analysis:**

- **Time to Collision (TTC):**
  - Using the formula: TTC = Distance / Relative Velocity
  - TTC = 20.33 / 5.2185 ≈ 3.89 seconds

- **Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC):**
  - At current trajectories, the two vehicles won't collide within the next second as significant relative speed allows for reactive safety.

**Risk Assessment:**

- Given the obstacle's decelerating pattern and its position ahead of the ego car, although there is a relative approach, the temporal buffer (TTC ≈ 3.89s) currently indicates a larger window for reactive safety.
- Continuous monitoring of both vehicles' deceleration rates is necessary as both are slowing, which affects TTC and potential collision metrics over time. 

**Summary:**

- **Time to Collision (TTC):** 3.89 seconds suggests reactive measures are viable.
- **Distance (MDC):** 20.33 meters, providing adequate clearance.
- **Overall Risk Conclusion:** The immediate risk is not extreme; however, vigilance is required due to decreasing speed and relatively high-speed approach by the ego vehicle.

**JSON Output:**

```json
{
    "CollisionObstacles": [],
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {},
    "HighRiskObstacle": {}
}
```

In this scenario, no obstacles have been classified with an overall risk score of 0 or 1 (Collision or Extreme Risk). The ego vehicle's approach provides room for safe maneuvers, and the scenario shows a manageable level of closure rate.
