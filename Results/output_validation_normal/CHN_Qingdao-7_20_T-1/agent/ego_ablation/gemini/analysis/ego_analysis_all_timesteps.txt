At t=0.9s, obstacle 30674 is located 15.51m longitudinally and 5.31m laterally from the ego vehicle, in the front-left zone.  The relative longitudinal velocity is -7.66 m/s, indicating the obstacle is approaching the ego vehicle.  However, the lateral relative velocity is 4.93 m/s, meaning the obstacle is moving away from the ego vehicle laterally. The decreasing lateral velocity suggests that this lateral movement away from the ego vehicle might slow down in the next time step.

While the obstacle is moving closer longitudinally, the lateral movement and the current distances suggest there is no immediate danger.  The situation requires monitoring, but it doesn't pose an extreme or high risk at this moment. A risk score of 3 (medium risk) seems appropriate given the closing longitudinal distance but increasing lateral distance.
