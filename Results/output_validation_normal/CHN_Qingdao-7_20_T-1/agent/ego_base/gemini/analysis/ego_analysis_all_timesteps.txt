At t=0.9s, Obstacle 30674 is 15.51m ahead longitudinally and 5.31m to the left laterally.  It's approaching the ego vehicle longitudinally at -7.66 m/s and moving away laterally at 4.93 m/s. The lateral movement slightly reduces the risk of collision, but the longitudinal closing speed is quite high.  Given the short distance and high closing speed, this represents a high risk.
