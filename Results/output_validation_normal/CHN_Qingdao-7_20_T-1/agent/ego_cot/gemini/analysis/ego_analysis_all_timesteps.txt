### Safety analysis for timestep 0.9s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:
- **Obstacle ID:** 30674
- **Distance Risk reason:** At 0.9 seconds, the obstacle is 15.51m longitudinally and 15.51m laterally away from the ego vehicle, positioned front-left.  While the distance is not extremely close, the continued longitudinal closing velocity suggests the distance might shrink further in subsequent timesteps.
- **Distance safety score:** 4 (Low Risk)
- **Time Risk reason:** The obstacle is moving towards the ego vehicle longitudinally with a closing velocity. While lateral movement suggests some divergence, the longitudinal component of motion needs attention.  Precise TTC calculation is not possible without explicit ego vehicle speed, but the closing motion warrants a low-risk assessment.
- **Time safety score:** 4 (Low Risk)
- **Overall Risk score:** 4 (Low Risk)
