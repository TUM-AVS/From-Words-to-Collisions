Obstacle 30674:

Trajectory Analysis: Over the past 0.9 seconds, Obstacle 30674 has been moving closer to the ego vehicle longitudinally while moving further away laterally.  The longitudinal distance has decreased from 20.10m to 15.51m, while the lateral distance has slightly increased from 4.83m to 5.31m.

TTC Calculation:
Longitudinal TTC = 15.51m / 7.66 m/s = 2.02 seconds
Lateral TTC is not applicable as the obstacle is moving away laterally.

MDC Calculation: Since the obstacle is moving away laterally, the MDC is primarily determined by the longitudinal distance.  The MDC is approximately 15.51m.

Risk Assessment:
- Longitudinal:  TTC of 2.02 seconds suggests a Medium Risk (3).
- Lateral: The increasing lateral distance indicates no risk in the lateral direction.

Overall Risk: Medium Risk (3) due to the closing longitudinal distance, even though the lateral movement is diverging.
