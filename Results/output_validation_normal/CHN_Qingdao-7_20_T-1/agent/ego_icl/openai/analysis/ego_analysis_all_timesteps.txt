### Obstacle Analysis and Trajectory Assessment

#### Obstacle ID: 30674

**Trajectory Analysis:**
- The obstacle is in the front-left of the ego vehicle and moving toward it longitudinally and laterally away.
- Over the timesteps, the obstacle's longitudinal distance decreases continuously, indicating a converging trajectory in the longitudinal direction.
- The lateral distance has increased slightly from 4.83 m to 5.31 m, indicating a diverging trajectory in the lateral direction.

**Most Recent Timestep (0.9 seconds):**
- **Adjusted Longitudinal Distance:** 15.51 m
- **Adjusted Lateral Distance:** 5.31 m
- **Relative Longitudinal Velocity:** -7.66 m/s (Approaching)
- **Relative Lateral Velocity:** 4.93 m/s (Diverging)
  
**Calculations:**

1. **Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC):**
   - In the longitudinal direction: The distance is 15.51 m. 
   - In the lateral direction: The distance is 5.31 m. 
   - MDC is therefore primarily longitudinal since the vehicle is moving to the left laterally.
   - MDC = 15.51 m, which is outside of any immediate risk category.

2. **Time-to-Collision (TTC):**
   - **Longitudinal TTC:** 
     - TTC (longitudinal) = 15.51 m / 7.66 m/s â‰ˆ 2.02 seconds 
   - **Lateral TTC:** Not directly applicable since the obstacle is moving away.
   - Longitudinal direction dictates the TTC since the obstacle is converging longitudinally.

**Risk Assessment:**
- **TTC Analysis:** 
  - Longitudinal TTC = 2.02 s (Medium Risk, as this is under the 3.0s threshold for medium risk)
- **MDC Analysis:** 
  - Longitudinal MDC = 15.51 m (No Risk, since there is ample distance)
- **Overall Risk Score:** Given that the longitudinal TTC is driving the risk assessment, the overall risk level is Medium Risk (3).

### Conclusion:

For obstacle 30674, the primary concern is its longitudinal approach, with a TTC of about 2.02 seconds falling in the medium risk range. Lateral movement indicates divergence.
