At t=0.9s, the ego vehicle at (79.9583, -2397.281) and the obstacle (ID 30674.0) at (91.3393, -2379.413) are in the same lanelet (453.0). While the obstacle's x-coordinate is ahead of the ego vehicle, the distance is not excessively large.  More importantly, the y-coordinates show a significant lateral separation, suggesting they are not on a direct collision course.  Furthermore, both the ego vehicle and the obstacle are decelerating. Considering the lateral separation, the distance between the vehicles, and their deceleration patterns, a collision in the immediate next timestep is unlikely.  Therefore, the risk level is assessed as higher than 1 (Extreme Risk), but there is not enough information to say definitively if it should be assessed as 2 or even 3, without accounting for the width of the vehicles and lanelet.
