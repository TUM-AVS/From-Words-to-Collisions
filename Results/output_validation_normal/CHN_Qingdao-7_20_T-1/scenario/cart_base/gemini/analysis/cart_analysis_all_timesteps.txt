At t=0.9s, the ego vehicle at (79.9583, -2397.281) and the obstacle (ID 30674.0) at (91.3393, -2379.413) are in the same lanelet (453.0). While the obstacle's x-coordinate is ahead of the ego vehicle, the difference is decreasing over time.  The y-coordinates show the vehicles are not perfectly aligned laterally, but the difference is small enough to be a concern. Considering the velocities and decelerations of both, a collision is not imminent in the next immediate timestep (i.e., not within the next 0.1s), but the rapid deceleration of the obstacle, combined with the ego vehicle's continued movement forward, presents a high risk scenario that may escalate quickly. Therefore, I categorize this as a high risk (2), not extreme risk (1).

  "CollisionObstacles": [],
  "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null,
  "ScenarioAnalysis": {
    "IsCollisionScenario": false,
    "Reasoning": "No immediate collision detected, but the obstacle's rapid deceleration and proximity to the ego vehicle in the same lanelet warrant a high-risk assessment.  The risk is currently high (2), not extreme (1)."
