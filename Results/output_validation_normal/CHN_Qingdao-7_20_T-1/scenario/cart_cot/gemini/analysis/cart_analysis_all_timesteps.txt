### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 30674.0
- Distance Risk reason: At the last timestep (0.9 seconds), the obstacle is approximately 18 meters ahead and 12 meters to the right of the ego vehicle.  While this isn't extremely close, the trajectories over the preceding timesteps show the obstacle moving slower than the ego vehicle and slightly towards the ego vehicle's path, specifically laterally. The lateral movement is concerning, even if the obstacle's deceleration is higher. The obstacle and ego vehicle are in the same lanelet.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: The ego vehicle is moving faster than the obstacle, but both are decelerating. The obstacle's deceleration is more significant, and the ego is showing signs of more consistent and less rapid braking. The relative velocities, combined with the lateral movement of the obstacle towards the ego vehicle's path, increases the risk. If the obstacle continues to decelerate at current rates it could stop in front of the ego vehicle or even potentially move into the path of the ego vehicle if its orientation were to change enough.
- Time safety score: 2
- Overall Risk score: 2

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. **Identify the most critical obstacles:** Obstacle 30674.0 is the only obstacle identified in the scenario and is sharing the same lanelet as the ego vehicle. Therefore, it is the most critical obstacle to analyze.

2. **Analyze their trajectories over all 10 timesteps:** The ego vehicle is moving faster and decelerating less than obstacle 30674.0.  The obstacle's trajectory shows a slight lateral movement towards the ego vehicle's path, along with decelerating relatively sharply. The ego is moving in a more straight line and decelerating relatively gently by comparison, which combined with the lateral movement from the obstacle increases collision risk. 

3. **Evaluate relative positions, velocities, and accelerations:**  The obstacle's lateral movement is a significant factor. Even though it is ahead of the ego vehicle, its trajectory suggests it might drift further into the ego vehicle's path.  The velocity difference is also a concern. The ego vehicle is faster, and both are decelerating. The obstacle decelerates heavily, with the ego's deceleration more gradual.  The relative deceleration is concerning, especially considering the lateral movement of the obstacle.

4. **Determine if any collision has occurred or is imminent:** No collision has occurred yet. However, the combination of lateral movement by the obstacle, the velocity difference, and the rates of deceleration make a future collision reasonably possible if current trends continue, hence the medium to high-risk assessment. 

5. **Explain your reasoning for your conclusion:** The continued lateral movement of the obstacle in conjunction with the velocity and deceleration differences and relative trajectories raises concerns about a possible collision if the obstacle continues decelerating at its current rate or changing orientation even further towards the ego's path, given the distance, orientation, and velocity differences between the two.

  "ScenarioAnalysis": {
    "IsCollisionScenario": false,
    "Reasoning": "While no collision has occurred, the obstacle's lateral movement towards the ego vehicle's path, coupled with the velocity difference and deceleration rates, presents a high risk of a future collision if these trends continue. The obstacle's higher deceleration compared to the ego vehicle, despite being ahead, adds to this risk."
