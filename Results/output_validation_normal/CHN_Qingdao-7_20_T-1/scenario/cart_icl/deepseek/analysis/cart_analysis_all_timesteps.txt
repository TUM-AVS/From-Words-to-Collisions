### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep:  
Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:
- **Obstacle ID**: 30674.0  
  - **Distance Risk reason**:  
    - The obstacle is in the same lanelet (453.0) as the ego vehicle.  
    - Over the past 9 timesteps, the distance between ego and obstacle has decreased from ~19.65m to ~11.38m.  
    - The obstacle is ahead of the ego vehicle but moving slower (ego: 11.4162 m/s, obstacle: 6.1977 m/s).  
    - The lateral separation is minimal (both are in the same lanelet).  
  - **Distance safety score**: 2 (High Risk)  
  - **Time Risk reason**:  
    - Relative velocity: ~5.22 m/s (ego is closing the gap).  
    - Time to collision (TTC): ~11.38m / 5.22m/s ≈ 2.18s.  
    - The obstacle is decelerating (-2.9122 m/s²), but the ego is also decelerating (-0.2997 m/s²).  
    - The gap is closing, but not at an extreme rate.  
  - **Time safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk)  
  - **Overall Risk score**: 2 (High Risk)  

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. **Same Lanelet**: Both ego and obstacle are in lanelet 453.0, indicating shared trajectory.  
2. **Distance Trend**: The distance is decreasing, but not at an alarming rate (from ~19.65m to ~11.38m over 0.9s).  
3. **Velocity/Acceleration**: The ego is faster but decelerating, while the obstacle is slower and decelerating more aggressively.  
4. **TTC**: ~2.18s is manageable but requires attention.  
5. **Conclusion**: No immediate collision (TTC > 2s), but high risk due to shared lane and closing distance.
