### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 30647**
  - **Distance Risk reason:** The obstacle is in a different lanelet and consistently moving away from the ego vehicle. The distance has been increasing over time.
  - **Distance safety score:** 5
  - **Time Risk reason:** Despite a steady increase in velocity, the obstacle's trajectory doesn't intersect with the ego vehicle.
  - **Time safety score:** 5
  - **Overall Risk score:** 5

- **Obstacle ID: 30648**
  - **Distance Risk reason:** The obstacle remains at a considerable distance and is not in the direct path of the ego vehicle. Movement is slightly erratic but away from the ego.
  - **Distance safety score:** 4
  - **Time Risk reason:** Velocity and acceleration indicate a consistent path that does not threaten the ego vehicle.
  - **Time safety score:** 4
  - **Overall Risk score:** 4

- **Obstacle ID: 30649**
  - **Distance Risk reason:** Static position in a lanelet not associated with the ego vehicle's trajectory. No change in position.
  - **Distance safety score:** 5
  - **Time Risk reason:** Since the velocity is zero, there is no temporal risk.
  - **Time safety score:** 5
  - **Overall Risk score:** 5

- **Obstacle ID: 30650**
  - **Distance Risk reason:** This obstacle has a trajectory that occasionally aligns with the ego vehicle but remains mostly lateral.
  - **Distance safety score:** 3
  - **Time Risk reason:** Steady increase in velocity could pose a future risk, but current trajectory is diverging.
  - **Time safety score:** 3
  - **Overall Risk score:** 3

- **Obstacle ID: 30651**
  - **Distance Risk reason:** Despite being in a nearby lanelet trajectory, its path does not intersect with the ego vehicle.
  - **Distance safety score:** 4
  - **Time Risk reason:** Acceleration shows possible future convergence but currently diverging path.
  - **Time safety score:** 3
  - **Overall Risk score:** 4

- **Obstacle ID: 30652**
  - **Distance Risk reason:** Moving on a path that is consistently parallel and lateral to the ego vehicle.
  - **Distance safety score:** 5
  - **Time Risk reason:** The decrease in acceleration indicates a decreasing risk over time.
  - **Time safety score:** 5
  - **Overall Risk score:** 5

- **Obstacle ID: 30653**
  - **Distance Risk reason:** Steady longitudinal path not intersecting with the ego's trajectory. Keeps moving farther.
  - **Distance safety score:** 5
  - **Time Risk reason:** Consistent path with a fixed negative acceleration, indicating increasing safety with time.
  - **Time safety score:** 5
  - **Overall Risk score:** 5

- **Obstacle ID: 30654**
  - **Distance Risk reason:** The trajectory is slightly converging, but the distance remains manageable.
  - **Distance safety score:** 3
  - **Time Risk reason:** Minimal acceleration change implies negligible altering risk.
  - **Time safety score:** 3
  - **Overall Risk score:** 3

- **Other Obstacles (30655 to 30687)**:
  - **Summary:** No significant risk identified due to being in different lanelets and having trajectories diverging from the ego vehicle's path.

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
After evaluating all obstacles over their trajectories and recent movements, no collision risks are identified due to the safe distance maintained or velocities that do not threaten the ego vehicle. Similarly, no obstacles were identified as posing extreme risk due to consistent non-conflicting paths.
