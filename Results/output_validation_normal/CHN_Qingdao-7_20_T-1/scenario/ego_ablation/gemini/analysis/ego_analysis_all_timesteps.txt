Obstacle 30674 is moving towards the ego vehicle longitudinally while moving away laterally.  At the last timestep (0.9 seconds), the obstacle is 15.51m longitudinally and 5.31m laterally away from the ego vehicle. Although it is approaching longitudinally with a relative velocity of -7.66 m/s, the lateral movement and distance suggest a low risk of collision in the immediate future.  However, continuous monitoring is necessary as the longitudinal distance is decreasing. The lateral velocity is also decreasing, which could eventually lead to a higher risk if the trend continues and the lateral distance begins to decrease.  Given the current information, the situation appears manageable with appropriate actions.
