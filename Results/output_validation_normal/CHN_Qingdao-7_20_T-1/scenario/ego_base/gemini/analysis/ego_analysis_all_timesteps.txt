Obstacle 30674 is moving towards the ego vehicle longitudinally while moving away laterally. At the most recent timestep (0.9 seconds), the longitudinal distance is decreasing at a rate of -7.66 m/s and the lateral distance is increasing at a rate of 4.93 m/s.  The longitudinal distance is 15.51 meters. Although the obstacle is approaching quickly longitudinally, the lateral movement suggests it might be passing in front, not directly into, the ego vehicle's path. Given the current rate of closure, a collision is possible within the next few seconds if the trends continue, placing it in a high-risk category.  However, more information is needed to definitively determine the collision probability.
