### Safety analysis for timestep 0.9 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 30674
- Distance Risk reason: At 0.9 seconds, Obstacle 30674 is 15.51m longitudinally and 15.51m laterally away from the ego vehicle, located front-left. While the longitudinal distance is decreasing, indicating a closing gap, the lateral movement suggests the obstacle is diverging. The combined distances, especially in the lateral direction, indicate a moderate risk at present.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason:  Although the provided data doesn't directly give TTC, we can infer risk from the relative velocities and distances.  The obstacle is closing longitudinally at -7.66 m/s while moving away laterally at 4.93 m/s. The closing longitudinal velocity raises concern; however, without precise dimensions of the vehicles, a definitive TTC cannot be calculated.  Based on the current trajectory and speed, the risk is medium as collision isn't imminent but possible if the lateral movement wasn't occurring.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3


### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
  "CollisionObstacle": null,
  "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null,
  "IsCollisionScenario": false,
  "Justification": "No obstacle shows an immediate collision risk. Obstacle 30674 presents a medium risk due to the closing longitudinal distance, but its diverging lateral movement mitigates the overall risk.  More data, including vehicle dimensions and precise TTC calculations, would strengthen this assessment."
