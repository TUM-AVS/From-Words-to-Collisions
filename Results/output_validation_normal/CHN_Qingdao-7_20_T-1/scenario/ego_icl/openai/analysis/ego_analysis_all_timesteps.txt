### Obstacle Analysis

#### Obstacle ID: 30674

- **Position and Motion Analysis:**
  - **Current Position (at 0.9s):**
    - Adjusted longitudinal distance: 15.51 m
    - Adjusted lateral distance: 5.31 m
  - **Trajectory:**
    - The obstacle is in the front-left, consistently moving towards the ego vehicle longitudinally while laterally moving away to the left.
    - Longitudinal distance is decreasing over time, indicating the obstacle is closing in on the ego vehicle.
    - Lateral distance is increasing, indicating the obstacle is moving away laterally.

- **Velocity and Acceleration:**
  - **Relative Velocity (at 0.9s):**
    - Longitudinal: -7.66 m/s (approaching)
    - Lateral: 4.93 m/s (moving away)
  - **Relative Acceleration (at 0.9s):**
    - Longitudinal: 0.29 m/s²
    - Lateral: -2.73 m/s²

- **TTC Calculation:**
  - **Longitudinal TTC:** 
    - TTC_longitudinal = 15.51 m / 7.66 m/s ≈ 2.02 seconds
  - **Lateral TTC:** 
    - TTC is non-applicable laterally as the lateral distance is increasing (obstacle moving away).

- **MDC Calculation:**
  - Given the trend, both the longitudinal and lateral distances are crucial, but the converging trajectory longitudinally takes precedence.
  - **MDC:** As lateral distance is increasing, MDC is driven by longitudinal proximity.
  - The longitudinal gap is the main influence here for MDC estimation.

- **Risk Assessment:**
  - **TTC Risk Assessment:**
    - Longitudinal TTC of 2.02 seconds falls into Medium Risk (3).
  - **MDC Risk Assessment:**
    - Considering only longitudinal motion since lateral distance is widening, the scenario is primarily driven by decreasing longitudinal distance which still remains reasonably above critical proximities at 15.51 m, no imminent collision is expected.

- **Overall Risk Score:** 
  - The risk score based on Medium TTC and MDC results in a Medium Risk (3).

### Collision Scenario Determination

- The provided scenario does not currently qualify as a collision scenario based on the specified criteria. The risk score highest criticality is Medium (3). The obstacle is moving away laterally, mitigating the collision risk.
