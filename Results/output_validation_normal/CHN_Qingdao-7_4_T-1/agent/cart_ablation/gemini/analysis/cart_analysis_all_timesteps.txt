Obstacle 30659 is moving faster than the ego vehicle and is located further along the lanelet. The distance between the ego vehicle and obstacle 30659 is increasing over time, indicating no immediate collision risk.

Obstacle 30661 is moving slower than the ego vehicle and is located behind the ego vehicle. The distance between the ego vehicle and obstacle 30661 is increasing over time, indicating no immediate collision risk.
