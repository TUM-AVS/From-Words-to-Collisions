At t=0.9s, the ego vehicle is at (10.8899, -2250.2151) with a velocity of 16.4145 and acceleration of -0.0014.  Let's analyze the two obstacles:

**Obstacle 30659.0:** Position (18.5059, -2263.8361), velocity 19.1991, acceleration -4.8299. This obstacle is relatively far from the ego vehicle, primarily in the negative Y direction.  While the X positions suggest potential for a collision, the large difference in Y positions and the fact that both vehicles seem to be heading in roughly the same direction (similar orientations) makes a collision unlikely in the very near future.

**Obstacle 30661.0:** Position (4.7752, -2239.2753), velocity 12.9215, acceleration 1.4932. This obstacle is closer to the ego vehicle and represents a higher risk. The obstacle is slightly behind the ego vehicle in the X-direction, but importantly, it is located at a significantly more positive Y coordinate. Given that the ego vehicle is moving faster, it is closing the distance in X, but the difference in Y positions indicates a significant lateral separation. It appears the vehicles are on slightly different trajectories.

**Calculations (approximations based on latest time step data):**

Due to the nature of Cartesian coordinates and the provided information, precise TTC and MDC calculations are complex without additional details (like vehicle dimensions and precise trajectories). However, we can make qualitative assessments.  Since the orientations are similar and both vehicles are moving forward primarily along the x-axis, the risk of collision is much lower.  


**Reasoning and Prediction:**

Based on the provided data, no immediate collision is predicted. Obstacle 30661.0 presents a higher risk than Obstacle 30659.0 due to its proximity in X, but the difference in Y coordinates and the fact that the ego vehicle is moving slightly faster suggest the ego vehicle will pull further ahead.  However, continued monitoring is crucial, especially for obstacle 30661.0,  in case the trajectories converge more significantly.  Obstacle 30659.0 appears far less likely to cause any collision.
