   - **Relative Distance:** ~6.11m behind longitudinally, ~10.94m laterally (same lanelet, but significant longitudinal separation).
   - **Relative Velocity:** Obstacle velocity = 12.9215 m/s, Ego velocity = 16.4145 m/s. Obstacle is accelerating (1.4932 m/s²), Ego is nearly constant.
   - **TTC:** Negative (obstacle is behind and closing in, but lateral distance is large).
   - **Risk Score:** 3 (Medium Risk).

### Conclusion:
- No collision or extreme risk observed in the most recent timestep (0.9s).
- Obstacle 30659 is ahead and moving away; Obstacle 30661 is behind but closing slowly with significant lateral separation.
