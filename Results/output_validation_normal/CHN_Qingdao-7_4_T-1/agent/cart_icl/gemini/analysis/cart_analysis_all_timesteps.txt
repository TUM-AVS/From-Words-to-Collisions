At t=0.9s, the ego vehicle is at (10.8899, -2250.2151) with a velocity of 16.4145 m/s.  Let's analyze the obstacles:

**Obstacle 30659:** Located at (18.5059, -2263.8361) with a velocity of 19.1991 m/s. This obstacle is ahead of the ego vehicle and to its left.  The lateral distance is significant, and while it's moving faster than the ego, the difference in orientation (-1.061 for both) suggests they are traveling in parallel, minimizing collision risk.  The consistent negative acceleration of this obstacle over the last few timesteps suggests it is braking. This further reduces risk. Risk: **Low (4)**

**Obstacle 30661:** Located at (4.7752, -2239.2753) with a velocity of 12.9215 m/s.  This obstacle is behind the ego and to its right. While the lateral separation isn't huge, the obstacle is moving slower than the ego. Given their current trajectories and the relatively slow closing speed, a collision is unlikely. Risk: **Medium (3)**
