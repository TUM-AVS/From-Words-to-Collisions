**Analysis of Scenario for Potential Collisions**

To evaluate the scenario at 0.9 seconds, we examine the relative positions and velocities of the ego vehicle and obstacles within the same lanelet (312.0).

**Ego Vehicle:**
- Position: (10.8899, -2250.2151)
- Velocity: 16.4145 m/s

**Obstacle 30659.0:**
- Position: (18.5059, -2263.8361)
- Velocity: 19.1991 m/s
- Obstacle is approximately 13.62 meters behind the ego in the y-axis. It is traveling faster than the ego, implying it's closing the gap, but the lateral distance is substantial enough to currently avoid immediate risk of collision. 

**Obstacle 30661.0:**
- Position: (4.7752, -2239.2753)
- Velocity: 12.9215 m/s
- Obstacle is approximately 10.94 meters in front of the ego in the y-axis and traveling slower. The relative velocity indicates that the gap is increasing, which lessens the risk over the short term. However, the impediment of higher velocity from the ego vehicle would allow it to close this gap over time, but current dynamics do not indicate a collisional path within immediate timelines.

Furthermore, a TTC evaluation using longitudinal positions and velocities shows:
- **Obstacle 30659.0**: The TTC cannot be determined as approaching due to lateral non-alignment, implying no direct frontal risk.
- **Obstacle 30661.0**: Similar to above, significant lateral offset implies no immediate collision threat.

Using the Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC) metric, both obstacles have adequate gaps and lateral distances, suggesting limited immediate collision risk.

**Summary:**
- Neither of the obstacles poses an immediate collision risk. Both obstacles display negligible to low dynamic threat owing to position differentials and velocity vectors in relation to the ego vehicle.
