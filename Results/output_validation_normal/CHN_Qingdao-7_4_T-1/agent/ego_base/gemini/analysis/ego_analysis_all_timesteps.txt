At t=0.9s:
- Obstacle 30659 is in front of the ego car, moving away at 2.78 m/s, and at a distance of 11.10 m. This poses a negligible risk.
- Obstacle 30661 is behind the ego car, moving away at -3.49 m/s, and at a distance of -8.02 m. This also poses a negligible risk.

Since both obstacles are moving away from the ego vehicle and are at safe distances, there are no high-risk obstacles.
