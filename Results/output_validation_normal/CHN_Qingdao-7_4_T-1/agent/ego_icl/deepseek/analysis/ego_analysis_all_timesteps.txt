### Obstacle-by-Obstacle Analysis

#### Obstacle 30659 (Front)
- **Position**: Front of ego car
- **Adjusted Distance**: Longitudinal 11.10 m, Lateral 0.00 m
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal 2.78 m/s (moving away), Lateral 0.00 m/s
- **Motion**: Moving away longitudinally, exact lateral alignment
- **Trajectory Analysis**:
  - Longitudinal distance is increasing (from 7.68 m to 11.10 m over 0.9 seconds).
  - Lateral distance remains 0.00 m (same lane alignment).
  - Relative velocity is positive longitudinally (moving away), so no closing risk.
  - Acceleration is negative longitudinally (-2.36 m/s²), indicating deceleration but still moving away.
- **TTC**: Not applicable (moving away, relative velocity is positive).
- **MDC**: 11.10 m (longitudinal), 0.00 m (lateral). Since lateral is 0.00 m but longitudinal is increasing, MDC is effectively 11.10 m.
- **Risk Assessment**:
  - MDC > 5.0 m: No Risk (5).
  - TTC not applicable (moving away).
  - **Overall Risk**: 5 (Negligible Risk).

#### Obstacle 30661 (Behind)
- **Position**: Behind ego car
- **Adjusted Distance**: Longitudinal -8.02 m, Lateral 0.00 m
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal -3.49 m/s (moving away), Lateral 0.00 m/s
- **Motion**: Moving away longitudinally, exact lateral alignment
- **Trajectory Analysis**:
  - Longitudinal distance is increasing (from -4.63 m to -8.02 m over 0.9 seconds).
  - Lateral distance remains 0.00 m (same lane alignment).
  - Relative velocity is negative longitudinally (moving away), so no closing risk.
  - Acceleration is positive longitudinally (0.73 m/s²), but still moving away.
- **TTC**: Not applicable (moving away, relative velocity is negative).
- **MDC**: 8.02 m (absolute longitudinal), 0.00 m (lateral). Since lateral is 0.00 m but longitudinal is increasing, MDC is effectively 8.02 m.
- **Risk Assessment**:
  - MDC > 5.0 m: No Risk (5).
  - TTC not applicable (moving away).
  - **Overall Risk**: 5 (Negligible Risk).
