Obstacle 30659 (Front):
- Trajectory: This obstacle has been consistently in front of the ego vehicle and moving away.  The longitudinal distance has increased from 7.68m to 11.10m over the 0.9 seconds. Lateral distance remains at 0.00m, indicating continued alignment in the same lane.
- TTC: Since the relative longitudinal velocity is positive (moving away), TTC is not meaningful in terms of collision risk.
- MDC: Given the increasing longitudinal distance and lateral alignment, MDC is considered to be the longitudinal distance, which is 11.10m at the last timestep.
- Risk: Negligible Risk (5)

Obstacle 30661 (Behind):
- Trajectory: This obstacle has been consistently behind the ego vehicle and moving away. The longitudinal distance has increased from -4.63m to -8.02m over the 0.9 seconds (the negative sign indicates it is behind). Lateral distance remains at 0.00m, indicating continued alignment in the same lane.
- TTC: Since the relative longitudinal velocity is negative (moving away), TTC is not meaningful in terms of collision risk.
- MDC:  Given the increasing longitudinal distance and lateral alignment, MDC is considered to be the longitudinal distance, which is 8.02m at the last timestep.
- Risk: Negligible Risk (5)
