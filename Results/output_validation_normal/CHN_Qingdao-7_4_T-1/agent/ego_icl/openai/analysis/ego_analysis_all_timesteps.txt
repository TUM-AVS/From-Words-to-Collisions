**Analysis of Obstacles**

### Obstacle 30659 Analysis:
- **Position & Motion Details**:
  - Continually moving away from the ego vehicle.
  - Located directly in front: longitudinal = 11.10 m, lateral = 0.00 m.
  - At the latest timestep, the relative velocity is 2.78 m/s longitudinally, moving away.
- **Trajectory Analysis**:
  - The obstacle is increasing its longitudinal distance from the ego vehicle over time, affirming it is moving away.
- **TTC and MDC Calculations**:
  - **Longitudinal Component**:
    - TTC is not applicable for collision as the relative velocity indicates the obstacle is moving away.
    - MDC relies primarily on current adjusted longitudinal distance, indicating no approaching trajectory.
- **Risk Assessment**:
  - As distances are increasing and velocities are non-converging, it can be determined that there's no significant risk.
  - Longitudinal distance is above 5.0 meters and increasing, which translates to a negligible risk for collision.
  
### Obstacle 30661 Analysis:
- **Position & Motion Details**: 
  - Located behind the ego car: longitudinally -8.02 m, implying a position behind, with lateral = 0.00 m.
  - Relatively moving away at -3.49 m/s longitudinally.
- **Trajectory Analysis**:
  - Similar to Obstacle 30659, this obstacle shows an increase in negative longitudinal distance over time, indicating continued motion away from the ego vehicle.
- **TTC and MDC Calculations**:
  - **Longitudinal Component**:
    - TTC not applicable due to the negative relative velocity suggesting the obstacle is getting farther away.
    - MDC based on adjusted longitudinal distance above 5.0 meters.
- **Risk Assessment**:
  - Both distance metrics and relative trajectories show that there's no significant threat of collision.
  - The increase in separation distance affirms a negligible risk classification.

**Final Interpretation:**
- Both obstacles 30659 and 30661 are moving away from the ego vehicle, with no projecting path intersections or concerning alignments for potential collision. The increasing distances and diverging velocities result in both obstacles being categorized under negligible risk, confirming no need for immediate intervention or collision concern.
