At t=0.9s, Ego is at (10.89, -2250.22) and Obstacle 30661 is at (4.78, -2239.28).  Obstacle 30659 is at (18.51, -2263.84).

Obstacle 30661 is relatively close to the Ego vehicle in terms of y-coordinate, though the x-coordinate difference suggests some lateral separation. However, analyzing the trajectories shows Obstacle 30661 is moving towards the Ego vehicle's lane and accelerating.  This presents an extreme risk.

Obstacle 30659's y-coordinate places it behind the Ego vehicle, and its x-coordinate suggests it is significantly further along the lanelet. While it has a higher velocity than Ego, its negative acceleration over the last few timesteps suggests it is braking. This obstacle does not pose an immediate collision risk.
