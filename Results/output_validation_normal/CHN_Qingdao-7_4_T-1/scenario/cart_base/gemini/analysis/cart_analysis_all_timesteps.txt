At t=0.9s, Ego is at (10.89, -2250.22) and obstacle 30659 is at (18.51, -2263.84). Obstacle 30661 is at (4.78,-2239.28).

Obstacle 30659, while further down the lane, has consistently been moving faster than Ego and towards Ego as well since the initial timesteps. This pattern, combined with their relatively small lateral displacement suggests a possible collision risk.

Obstacle 30661 is behind Ego and moving slower, so is not presenting an immediate risk of collision.

Based on the provided data points, there are no imminent collisions. However, due to the high closing rate between Ego and obstacle 30659, it is classified as High Risk as more drastic changes are needed to avoid an imminent collision.
