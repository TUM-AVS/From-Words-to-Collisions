### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep:

### Obstacle Analysis:
#### Obstacle ID: 30659.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is ahead of the ego vehicle in the same lanelet (lanelet 312.0). Over the past timesteps, the distance between the ego and this obstacle has been decreasing, but the obstacle is still relatively far ahead (~12.6m at the most recent timestep). The obstacle is decelerating (a = -4.8299 m/s²), while the ego is maintaining a nearly constant speed (v = 16.4145 m/s, a ≈ 0).
- **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
- **Time Risk reason**: The relative velocity is decreasing as the obstacle decelerates. The time to collision (TTC) is increasing due to the obstacle's deceleration. The current TTC is sufficiently large (>2s).
- **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
- **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low Risk)

#### Obstacle ID: 30661.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is behind the ego vehicle in the same lanelet (lanelet 312.0). Over the past timesteps, the distance between the ego and this obstacle has been decreasing, but the obstacle is still relatively far behind (~10.9m at the most recent timestep). The obstacle is accelerating (a = 1.4932 m/s²), but its speed (v = 12.9215 m/s) is still lower than the ego's speed (v = 16.4145 m/s).
- **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
- **Time Risk reason**: The relative velocity is negative (ego is moving away from the obstacle), and the obstacle's acceleration is not sufficient to overtake the ego in the near future. The TTC is effectively infinite (no collision course).
- **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low Risk)

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. Both obstacles are in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle.
2. Obstacle 30659.0 is ahead and decelerating, while the ego is maintaining speed. The distance is large enough to avoid immediate risk.
3. Obstacle 30661.0 is behind and accelerating, but its speed is still lower than the ego's. The distance is increasing.
4. No obstacles are on a direct collision course with the ego at the current timestep.
5. The scenario is not a collision scenario, and no obstacles pose an extreme risk.
