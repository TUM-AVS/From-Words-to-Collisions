### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep

### Obstacle Analysis:

#### Obstacle ID: 30659
- **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is in close proximity to the ego in the same lanelet (312.0) with minimal longitudinal separation. Its position indicates convergence towards the ego vehicle from historic data.
- **Distance safety score**: 2 (High Risk)
- **Time Risk reason**: The obstacle is moving at a higher velocity than the ego vehicle and is accelerating, reducing the gap over time.
- **Time safety score**: 2 (High Risk)
- **Overall Risk score**: 2

#### Obstacle ID: 30661
- **Distance Risk reason**: In lanelet 312.0, nearer than other obstacles behind the ego vehicle with some separation maintained throughout history, position suggest approach but slower than ego.
- **Distance safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk)
- **Time Risk reason**: While initially appearing to accelerate towards the ego, its velocity gain is not excessive. Using historic context, close monitoring remains necessary due to potential acceleration.
- **Time safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk)
- **Overall Risk score**: 3

#### Obstacle ID: 30657
- **Distance Risk reason**: Positioned forward in the same lanelet (312.0) as ego, showing a consistent pattern of moving ahead without immediate threat of encroachment.
- **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
- **Time Risk reason**: Although the velocity exceeds the ego's, its trajectory suggests it's departing, reducing collision potential.
- **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
- **Overall Risk score**: 4

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
This is not a collision scenario, given the relative paths and velocities, especially for obstacle 30659. It shows high proximity and moderate convergence risk, but the limited historical collision probability considering trajectory trend reduces it to high risk instead of immediate collision, warranting significant caution but not immediate impact.
