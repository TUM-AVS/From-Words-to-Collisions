Both obstacles are moving away from the ego vehicle longitudinally and laterally (although the lateral movement isn't apparent initially due to the 0.00 m lateral values, the relative lateral acceleration suggests lateral motion is developing). At the most recent timestep (0.9 seconds), both obstacles have increased their distance from the ego vehicle compared to previous timesteps, indicating no immediate risk of collision.
