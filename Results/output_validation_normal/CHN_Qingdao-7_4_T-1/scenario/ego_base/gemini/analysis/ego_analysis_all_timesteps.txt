At t=0.9s, Obstacle 30659 is in front of the ego vehicle, moving away at 2.78 m/s with a longitudinal distance of 11.10 m.  Obstacle 30661 is behind the ego vehicle, also moving away at -3.49 m/s with a longitudinal distance of -8.02 m. Both obstacles present negligible risk.

**Risk Levels and Definitions:**
<Collision (Score: 0)>: Actual collision has occurred or is unavoidable within the next timestep.
<Extreme Risk (Score: 1)>: Immediate collision or very high likelihood of impact. Urgent action is required.
<High Risk (Score: 2)>: Close to collision or highly probable collision path. Needs prompt attention and quick manoeuvring.
<Medium Risk (Score: 3)>: Moderate collision risk but manageable with timely reactions and proper strategies.
<Low Risk (Score: 4)>: Minimal collision risk. The situation is controllable with sufficient time to react.
<Negligible Risk (Score: 5)>: No significant collision risk. Obstacles are either moving away or far enough not to interfere.
