### Safety analysis for timestep 0.9 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

There are no adjusted distances provided, so the raw DTClong and DTClat values will be used.  Since lateral velocity is zero for both obstacles and they are moving away longitudinally, TTClat is not a primary concern. We'll focus on TTClong and DTClong.

### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID:** 30659
- **Distance Risk reason:** Obstacle is in front and moving away (DTClong = 11.10m, DTClat = 11.10m). Large lateral distance indicates no lateral risk.
- **Distance safety score:** 5
- **Time Risk reason:** Obstacle is moving away longitudinally (positive and increasing DTClong), so TTClong is essentially infinite. 
- **Time safety score:** 5
- **Overall Risk score:** 5

- **Obstacle ID:** 30661
- **Distance Risk reason:** Obstacle is behind and moving away (DTClong = -8.02m, DTClat = -8.02m). Large lateral distance and being behind indicate no risk.
- **Distance safety score:** 5
- **Time Risk reason:** Obstacle is moving away longitudinally (negative and decreasing DTClong), so TTClong is essentially infinite.
- **Time safety score:** 5
- **Overall Risk score:** 5


### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
  "CollisionObstacle": null,
  "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null,
  "IsCollisionScenario": false,
  "Justification": "No obstacles pose a collision risk. Both obstacles are moving away from the ego vehicle in the longitudinal direction and have significant lateral separation."
}
