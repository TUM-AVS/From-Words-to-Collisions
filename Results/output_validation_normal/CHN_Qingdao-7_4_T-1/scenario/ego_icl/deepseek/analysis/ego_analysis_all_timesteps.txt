### Obstacle-by-Obstacle Analysis

#### Obstacle 30659 (Front)
- **Most Recent Timestep (0.9s):**
  - **Adjusted Distance:** Longitudinal 11.10 m, Lateral 0.00 m
  - **Relative Velocity:** Longitudinal 2.78 m/s (moving away), Lateral 0.00 m/s
  - **Motion Description:** "Obstacle is moving away longitudinally. Exact lateral alignment or unknown case."
  
- **Trajectory Analysis:**
  - Longitudinal distance increases from 7.68 m (0.1s) to 11.10 m (0.9s), indicating the obstacle is moving away from the ego vehicle.
  - Lateral distance remains 0.00 m (aligned), but no lateral movement is observed.
  
- **TTC Calculation:**
  - Longitudinal: Not applicable (relative velocity is positive, moving away).
  - Lateral: Not applicable (no relative velocity).
  
- **MDC Calculation:**
  - Lateral distance is 0.00 m, but since the obstacle is moving away longitudinally, the MDC is effectively infinite (no collision path).
  
- **Risk Assessment:**
  - **MDC Risk:** 5 (No Risk, MDC > 5.0 m)
  - **TTC Risk:** 5 (No Risk, TTC not applicable)
  - **Overall Risk:** 5 (No Risk)

#### Obstacle 30661 (Behind)
- **Most Recent Timestep (0.9s):**
  - **Adjusted Distance:** Longitudinal -8.02 m, Lateral 0.00 m
  - **Relative Velocity:** Longitudinal -3.49 m/s (moving away), Lateral 0.00 m/s
  - **Motion Description:** "Obstacle is moving away longitudinally. Exact lateral alignment or unknown case."
  
- **Trajectory Analysis:**
  - Longitudinal distance increases in magnitude from -4.63 m (0.1s) to -8.02 m (0.9s), indicating the obstacle is moving away from the ego vehicle.
  - Lateral distance remains 0.00 m (aligned), but no lateral movement is observed.
  
- **TTC Calculation:**
  - Longitudinal: Not applicable (relative velocity is negative, moving away).
  - Lateral: Not applicable (no relative velocity).
  
- **MDC Calculation:**
  - Lateral distance is 0.00 m, but since the obstacle is moving away longitudinally, the MDC is effectively infinite (no collision path).
  
- **Risk Assessment:**
  - **MDC Risk:** 5 (No Risk, MDC > 5.0 m)
  - **TTC Risk:** 5 (No Risk, TTC not applicable)
  - **Overall Risk:** 5 (No Risk)

### Collision Scenario Determination
- Neither obstacle has a risk score of 0 (collision) or 1 (extreme risk).
- Both obstacles are moving away from the ego vehicle in the longitudinal direction, and there is no lateral movement or convergence.
- No collision or imminent collision risk is present.
