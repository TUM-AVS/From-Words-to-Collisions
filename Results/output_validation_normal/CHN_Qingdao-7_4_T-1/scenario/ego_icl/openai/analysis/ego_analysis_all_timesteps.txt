**Analysis of Each Obstacle:**

### Obstacle 30659
#### Trajectory Analysis:
- **Initial Position and Movement**: Positioned in front of the ego vehicle. Over consecutive timesteps, the longitudinal distance has increased from 7.68m to 11.10m, indicating it is moving away.
- **Relative Velocity and Acceleration**: The relative longitudinal velocity is positive (initially 4.54 m/s, reducing to 2.78 m/s, with minor positive acceleration changes) indicating the obstacle is moving away from the ego vehicle, reducing the collision risk.

#### At the Most Recent Timestep (0.9 seconds):
- **Adjusted Longitudinal Distance**: 11.10 m (distance is increasing)
- **Relative Velocity (Longitudinal)**: 2.78 m/s (moving away velocity)
  
#### Calculations:
- **Time-to-Collision (TTC)**:
  - Since the obstacle is moving away, TTC is not applicable for collision risk.
  
- **Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC)**:
  - MDC calculated using ongoing separation, currently > 11.10m.
  
#### Risk Assessment:
- **Risk Score**: 5 (No Risk), because the obstacle is consistently moving away and increasing the separation, ensuring no collision path evident.

### Obstacle 30661
#### Trajectory Analysis:
- **Initial Position and Movement**: Positioned behind the ego vehicle. Longitudinal distance becomes more negative from -4.63m to -8.02m.
- **Relative Velocity and Acceleration**: The relative longitudinal velocity is negative but decreasing in magnitude (from -5.23 m/s to -3.49 m/s), indicating it is also moving away but closing trajectory is observed.

#### At the Most Recent Timestep (0.9 seconds):
- **Adjusted Longitudinal Distance**: -8.02 m
- **Relative Velocity (Longitudinal)**: -3.49 m/s (moving away)
  
#### Calculations:
- **Time-to-Collision (TTC)**:
  - TTC is not applicable as the distance is increasing and separation is ongoing.

- **Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC)**:
  - MDC is based on trajectory paths; currently, > 8.02m and increasing.
  
#### Risk Assessment:
- **Risk Score**: 5 (No Risk), because even though it is moving behind, it is clearly continuing to move away from the ego vehicle.

### Conclusion:
- Both obstacles are moving away from the ego vehicle, and neither presents a trajectory causing an imminent collision risk.
- There is no intersection or collision trajectory in the projected path given the motion profiles.

**Final Conclusion**: This is not a collision scenario as both Obstacles 30659 and 30661 demonstrate consistent and increasing separation from the ego vehicle.
