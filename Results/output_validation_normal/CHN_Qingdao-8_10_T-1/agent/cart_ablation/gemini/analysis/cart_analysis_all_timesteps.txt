Obstacle 30618 is in the adjacent lane (206) and initially poses a medium risk as it's traveling faster than the ego vehicle but with a safe lateral distance. However, over the subsequent timesteps, its lateral distance to the ego vehicle decreases, increasing the risk level.  By 0.9 seconds, obstacle 30618 is approaching the ego vehicle's rear, and while not an immediate collision, the risk is elevated due to the closing distance and speed differential. This warrants close monitoring and categorizes it as a high risk.

Obstacle 30619 starts further away and in a different lane (1097).  However, it's changing lanes and its trajectory appears to be converging with the ego vehicle's path. This, combined with its increasing velocity, escalates the risk to a medium level by 0.9 seconds, requiring attention.

Obstacle 30623 is initially in a different lanelet (940) and some distance behind the ego. However, its lane changes and its trajectory shows it progressively getting closer to the ego vehicle.  This trend, if continued, might lead to a risky situation. Currently, the lateral distance remains safe enough to consider it a medium risk at 0.9 seconds, demanding vigilance.
