Obstacle 30618 is consistently in lanelet 206, which is adjacent to the ego vehicle's lanelet 205.  Its lateral distance to the ego vehicle is decreasing over time. While the ego vehicle is decelerating, obstacle 30618 maintains a higher velocity and its acceleration fluctuates but generally remains positive. This suggests a potential for a lane change maneuver by 30618 or a potential sideswipe collision if the ego vehicle does not react appropriately. This warrants a high-risk assessment.

Obstacle 30619 initially poses a medium risk as it is in a different lane (1097) but its trajectory shows it moving closer to lanelet 206, occupied by obstacle 30618 and adjacent to the ego vehicle.  By 0.8 seconds, 30619 is in lanelet 206, increasing the risk further. Its acceleration is generally positive while the ego vehicle is decelerating. This warrants monitoring for increased risk in the near future.

Obstacle 30623 starts relatively far from the ego vehicle but shows signs of moving towards lanelet 1096, which based on the presence of other obstacles might be a path conflicting with the ego vehicle or other high-risk obstacles.  This combined with its varying acceleration requires careful monitoring for potential future risk escalation.
