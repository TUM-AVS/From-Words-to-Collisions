At t=0.9s, the ego vehicle is at (706.449, -1498.9151) with a velocity of 3.8068 and acceleration of -0.4295.  Let's analyze the risk posed by each obstacle at this timestep, considering their trajectories from previous timesteps.

**Obstacle 30615:** Located in lanelet 206 at (724.757, -1497.683), velocity 13.0995, acceleration -0.5893. This obstacle is ahead and slightly to the left of the ego vehicle. While there's a lateral offset, this obstacle is moving faster than the ego vehicle, and the ego vehicle is decelerating, therefore the MDC will decrease and TTC values will decrease. This warrants close monitoring, but it's not an immediate collision risk at this timestep.

**Obstacle 30618:** Located in lanelet 206 at (700.8842, -1504.2593), velocity 9.1846, acceleration 1.3862. Located slightly behind and to the left side of the ego, and moving at a higher speed while accelerating, likely not an immediate threat. 


**Obstacle 30619:**  Located in lanelet 206 at (700.8842, -1504.2593), velocity 9.1846, acceleration 1.3862. This obstacle is close to the ego vehicle in the lateral direction. The difference in the y-coordinates show some overlap, but the accelerating nature and forward position might lessen the risk after a small duration.


**Obstacle 30620:** Located in lanelet 369 at (696.8345, -1521.7576), velocity 3.6596, acceleration -0.2638. This obstacle is far behind and to the left and poses no immediate risk.

**Obstacle 30623:** Located in lanelet 371 at (690.896, -1497.069), velocity 7.3936, and acceleration 1.7641. This obstacle is behind the ego vehicle, but it's accelerating quickly. However, the trajectory from prior timesteps show it might not be a collision risk.


**Obstacle 30639:** Located in lanelet 1096 at (694.0182, -1510.9218), velocity 3.8609, acceleration 2.3354. While located diagonally behind the ego vehicle, it's accelerating at a greater rate than the others, but still no immediate threat of collision.




Considering the positions, velocities, and accelerations at the latest timestep (0.9 seconds), no obstacle poses an immediate collision risk. Obstacle 30619 requires the closest attention due to its proximity and higher velocity, but based on the provided data, a collision is not predicted in the immediate future. Obstacle 30618 is also high risk, as it is accelerating quickly and is located close to the ego vehicle, but it does not merit the extreme risk classification.
