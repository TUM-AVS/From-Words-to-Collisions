At t=0.9s, the ego vehicle is at (706.449, -1498.9151) with a velocity of 3.8068 m/s and acceleration of -0.4295 m/sÂ². Let's analyze the risk posed by each obstacle:

* **Obstacle 30615:** Located at (724.757, -1497.683), this obstacle is ahead and slightly to the left of the ego vehicle. It's moving faster than the ego vehicle (13.0995 m/s) and slightly decelerating. Given its lateral position and the difference in longitudinal velocities, the risk of collision appears low.

* **Obstacle 30618:**  At (724.757, -1497.683), this obstacle is also ahead and to the left, moving faster (13.0995 m/s). While its trajectory seems to keep it ahead of the ego vehicle, further data points are needed to confirm its lateral movement with greater certainty. For now, we classify the risk as low.

* **Obstacle 30619:** Located at (700.8842, -1504.2593) and moving at 9.1846 m/s, this obstacle is approximately to the ego vehicle's rear right. Its trajectory is roughly parallel to the ego vehicle but further analysis is required to assess long-term risks. Medium risk.

* **Obstacle 30620:** This obstacle is far behind and to the left of the ego vehicle, posing no immediate risk.

* **Obstacle 30623:** Located at (690.896, -1497.069), this obstacle is behind and to the left of the ego. It is moving with 7.3936m/s, so slightly faster than the ego. It poses no immediate risk.

* **Obstacle 30639:**  This obstacle is also significantly behind the ego vehicle and presents negligible risk.
