Let's perform a detailed analysis for each obstacle comparing it to the ego vehicle at the most recent timestep (0.9 seconds). We will examine the relative positions, velocities, and other factors to determine the risk levels:

### Obstacle Analysis:

1. **Obstacle 30615** was moving in a different lanelet entirely (206.0 km/h) with a much higher velocity than the ego vehicle and hence presents no immediate risk.
   
2. **Obstacle 30618**
   - Relative position: Ahead by about 18.308 meters in lanelet 206.0.
   - Relative velocity: Much faster than ego at 13.0995 m/s.
   - Time to Collision (TTC): Since it's ahead and faster, it's moving away rather than towards ego.
   - Risk: Negligible (5)

3. **Obstacle 30619**
   - Relative position: Approximately 7.4382 meters away, moving towards the ego's lane in a complex trajectory.
   - Relative velocity: Faster than ego at 9.1846 m/s but crossing from a nearby lanelet (206.0 to 205.0).
   - Time to Cross (TTC): ~ 7.4 / (9.1846 - 3.8) = 1.36 s
   - Risk: Medium Risk (3), requires monitoring.

4. **Obstacle 30620**
   - Relative position: Lagging behind ego by approximately 22 meters, velocity lower and in a distant lanelet.
   - Risk: Low (4)

5. **Obstacle 30623**
   - Relative position: On a parallel track, 15.553 meters behind, increasing velocity, in lanelet 371.0.
   - Risk: Minimal (4)

6. **Obstacle 30639**
   - Relative position: Similarly distant at about 12.1 meters behind ego, with a steady trajectory in a parallel lane (1096.0).
   - Risk: Negligible (5).

### Brief Explanation:

- **Obstacle 30619** presents the highest risk among the analyzed vehicles with a possible crossing situation in transit towards the ego's path. It's moving from lanelet 1097.0 to lanelet 206.0, closely aligned with the ego's routes. The moderate risk reflects the need to continuously monitor and be prepared for evasive maneuvers.

### JSON Output:

```json
{
    "CollisionObstacles": [],
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {},
    "HighRiskObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": "30619",
        "OverallRiskScore": 3
    }
}
```

In this analysis, we've focused on obstacle 30619 due to its trajectory and relative velocity intersecting with the egoâ€™s future path. Nevertheless, it is still within a manageable risk with adequate monitoring.
