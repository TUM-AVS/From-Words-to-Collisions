### Safety analysis for timestep 0.9s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

It's important to note that the provided scenario information lacks ego vehicle dimensions and shape, as well as obstacle dimensions and shape.  This makes a precise calculation of adjusted distances and TTC impossible.  Therefore, the analysis will be based on the *relative* distances and velocities provided, acknowledging that the true safety situation might be different if accurate vehicle dimensions were available.  I will assume a simplified vehicle shape (point mass) for this analysis, meaning `adjusted_d_long` and `adjusted_d_lat` are equal to the provided real distance values.

**Assumptions (due to missing data):**

* Ego vehicle and obstacles are treated as point masses.
* TTC calculations are simplified due to lacking acceleration information and assuming constant velocity.
* "Close proximity" thresholds for risk assessment are subjective in the absence of vehicle size information.  I'll use distances of < 3m as a general guideline for high risk.

### Obstacle Analysis:

**- Obstacle ID: 30618**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is moving away longitudinally and far from ego vehicle.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Moving away from ego vehicle longitudinally.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

**- Obstacle ID: 30619**
- Distance Risk reason: In the front-left and very close to the ego vehicle (2.24m).
- Distance safety score: 1
- Time Risk reason: Approaching ego vehicle longitudinally and laterally; appears to be on a collision course if velocities remain constant. Lateral distance very small.
- Time safety score: 1
- Overall Risk score: 1

**- Obstacle ID: 30620**
- Distance Risk reason: In the front-left, relatively close to the ego vehicle (10.65m).
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: Approaching ego vehicle longitudinally and laterally.  
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3

**- Obstacle ID: 30623**
- Distance Risk reason: In the front-right, relatively close to the ego vehicle (10.05m).
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: Approaching ego vehicle longitudinally, moving away laterally. Lateral movement mitigates risk.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3


**- Obstacle ID: 30639**
- Distance Risk reason: In front-left, relatively close to the ego vehicle (10.59m).
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason:  Approaching ego vehicle longitudinally and laterally.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3
