### Analysis of Each Obstacle at the Most Recent Timestep (0.9 seconds):

#### Obstacle 30618:
- **Direction**: Rear-left
- **Adjusted Distances**: Longitudinal = -13.50m, Lateral = 1.90m
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal = -16.91 m/s, Lateral = 0.00 m/s
- **Motion**: Obstacle moving away longitudinally, laterally stable.
- **Trajectory Analysis**: Continues to move away; both longitudinal and lateral velocities indicate moving away.
- **TTC Calculation**: Not applicable, longitudinally moving away.
- **Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC)**: Both dimensions moving away, no collision risk.
- **Risk Assessment**: Negligible Risk (5)

#### Obstacle 30619:
- **Direction**: Front-left
- **Adjusted Distances**: Longitudinal = 2.24m, Lateral = 2.13m
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal = -12.95 m/s, Lateral = -0.84 m/s
- **Motion**: Driving toward the ego longitudinally and laterally.
- **Trajectory Analysis**: Both adjusted metrics are decreasing, obstacle encroaching.
- **TTC Calculation**: Longitudinal TTC = 2.24 / 12.95 = 0.17s, Lateral TTC = 2.13 / 0.84 = 2.54s
- **Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC)**: Given the motion, close to MDC < 0.5m in future.
- **Risk Assessment**: Extreme Risk (1) due to very short TTC longitudinally and rapid closing distance.

#### Obstacle 30620:
- **Direction**: Front-left
- **Adjusted Distances**: Longitudinal = 10.65m, Lateral = 18.00m
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal = -3.83 m/s, Lateral = -3.66 m/s
- **Motion**: Driving toward the ego longitudinally and laterally.
- **Trajectory Analysis**: Slow horizontal approach, longer time to possible interaction.
- **TTC Calculation**: Longitudinal TTC = 10.65 / 3.83 = 2.78s, Lateral TTC = 18.00 / 3.66 = 4.92s
- **Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC)**: Continuation of current trajectory reduces concern.
- **Risk Assessment**: Medium Risk (3), due to longitudinal convergence.

#### Obstacle 30623:
- **Direction**: Front-right
- **Adjusted Distances**: Longitudinal = 10.05m, Lateral = 4.17m
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal = -2.45 m/s, Lateral = -7.27 m/s
- **Motion**: Approaching longitudinally and laterally outward.
- **Trajectory Analysis**: Continued lateral push away reduces collision concerns over time.
- **TTC Calculation**: Longitudinal TTC = 10.05 / 2.45 = 4.10s, Lateral TTC not considered due to lateral exit.
- **Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC)**: Low lateral closure; stable move outward.
- **Risk Assessment**: Low Risk (4)

#### Obstacle 30639:
- **Direction**: Front-left
- **Adjusted Distances**: Longitudinal = 10.59m, Lateral = 6.80m
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal = -3.83 m/s, Lateral = -3.86 m/s
- **Motion**: Converging toward ego car on both axes.
- **Trajectory Analysis**: Gradual crowding due to slow coordinated approach.
- **TTC Calculation**: Longitudinal TTC = 10.59 / 3.83 = 2.77s, Lateral TTC = 6.80 / 3.86 = 1.76s
- **Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC)**: Mutually closing paths, but still manageable response time.
- **Risk Assessment**: Medium Risk (3)

### Conclusion:
- **Obstacle 30619** poses an "Extreme Risk" due to its imminent closure trajectory and very low longitudinal TTC, which suggests quick action is needed.
- **Obstacles 30620 and 30639** show manageable medium risk, allowing careful oversight.
- **Obstacles 30618 and 30623** do not present significant immediate threats given their paths and relative velocities.
