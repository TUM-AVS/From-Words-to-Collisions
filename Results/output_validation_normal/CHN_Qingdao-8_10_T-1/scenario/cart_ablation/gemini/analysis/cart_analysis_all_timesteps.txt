At t=0.9s, Ego is in lanelet 205. Let's analyze the latest positions and trajectories of the obstacles:

* **Obstacle 30618:** Located in lanelet 206, moving with a velocity of 13.0995 m/s. Its trajectory suggests it will remain in lanelet 206, adjacent to Ego's lanelet. Given the lateral separation and consistent velocities, a collision is unlikely. Risk score: 4 (Low).
* **Obstacle 30619:** Located in lanelet 206, traveling at 9.1846 m/s. This obstacle shares the same lanelet as obstacle 30618 and is behind it. The trajectories indicate no immediate risk to the Ego vehicle. Risk score: 4 (Low).
* **Obstacle 30620:** In lanelet 369 with a velocity of 3.6596 m/s. It's far from the Ego vehicle and poses no risk. Risk score: 5 (Negligible).
* **Obstacle 30623:** In lanelet 371, moving at 7.3936 m/s. Its trajectory shows movement away from the Ego vehicle. Risk score: 5 (Negligible).
* **Obstacle 30639:** Located in lanelet 1096 with a velocity of 3.8609 m/s.  It's far from the Ego vehicle and poses no risk. Risk score: 5 (Negligible).
