At t=0.9s, Ego is in lanelet 205. Let's analyze the obstacles:

* **Obstacle 30618:** Located in lanelet 206 at (724.757, -1497.683), velocity 13.0995 m/s.  This obstacle is close to the ego vehicle and in the adjacent lane, but the trajectories and current separation suggest sufficient time to react.  Thus, not an extreme risk.

* **Obstacle 30619:** Located in lanelet 206 at (700.8842, -1504.2593), velocity 9.1846 m/s. While this obstacle shares the same lanelet as obstacle 30618, the data shows it is further away from the ego vehicle and its trajectory doesn't pose an immediate collision threat. Not an extreme risk.

* **Other Obstacles:** The remaining obstacles are significantly further from the ego vehicle and/or moving away, posing no immediate threat.
