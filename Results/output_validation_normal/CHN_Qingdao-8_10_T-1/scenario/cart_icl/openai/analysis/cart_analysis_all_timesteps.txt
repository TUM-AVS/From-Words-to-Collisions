### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 30612**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is in the same lanelet (205.0) and decreasing distance with the ego vehicle. Consistently decelerating, reducing speed over time.
  - **Distance safety score**: 2 (High Risk due to proximity and reducing distance)
  - **Time Risk reason**: Significant negative acceleration indicates slowing but not enough to prevent a collision. Trend shows consistent deceleration without sharp maneuvers.
  - **Time safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk as it's slowing down significantly over time)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 2

- **Obstacle ID: 30614**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is traveling parallel in a different lanelet (206.0), not crossing paths with Ego. Steady speed and some acceleration noted.
  - **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk due to different lanelet and stable conditions)
  - **Time Risk reason**: Consistent speed and stable trajectory. No sudden changes in acceleration or velocity over time.
  - **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk as no abrupt changes indicating danger)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 30615**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Positioned in a different lanelet (206.0) and consistently maintaining or slightly increasing speed with stable trajectory parallel to ego.
  - **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk due to lane separation)
  - **Time Risk reason**: Velocity stable and only small variations in acceleration.
  - **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk as trajectory and velocity are steady)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 30616**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Despite deceleration, the obstacle is close due to high speed and positioning within the same lanelet (205.0).
  - **Distance safety score**: 2 (High Risk based on speed, position)
  - **Time Risk reason**: Negligible positive acceleration trend but rapid deceleration observed.
  - **Time safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk due to high-speed deceleration)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 2

- **Obstacle ID: 30622**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Large distance maintained due to significantly high velocity and positioned in lanelet 205.0. Accelerating steadily.
  - **Distance safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk from same lanelet but high speed)
  - **Time Risk reason**: Consistent deceleration but notable high velocity along the trajectory.
  - **Time safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk, fast deceleration potentially risky)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 3

- **Obstacle ID: 30627**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Decreasing velocity and acceleration suggest an easing pattern but positioned in lanelet 205.0.
  - **Distance safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk due to proximity and approach pattern)
  - **Time Risk reason**: Deceleration observed but consistent behavior over history.
  - **Time safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk as steady deceleration continues)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 3

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
Upon assessing the recent trajectory and behavior of the obstacles within lanelet 205.0, none exhibit zero distance or direct collision course despite high-risk proximity levels. Some obstacles demonstrate concerning patterns, notably 30612 and 30616, due to their relative positions and velocities, implying prompt attention but not collisions within the timeframe.
