Obstacle 30619 shows the highest risk. At 0.9 seconds, its longitudinal distance to the ego vehicle is a mere 2.24 meters, with a closing velocity of -12.95 m/s.  Laterally, it's at 2.13 meters and moving towards the ego car at -0.84 m/s. This indicates a very high probability of collision within the next timestep.
