Obstacle 30619 is at high risk due to its proximity to the ego vehicle, both longitudinally (2.24 m) and laterally (2.13 m).  It is approaching the ego vehicle longitudinally at -12.95 m/s and laterally at -0.84 m/s. While the lateral velocity is relatively small, the short distance suggests a potential collision if the current trajectories continue.

Obstacle 30623 also poses a risk although not as imminent as 30619. While it is further away longitudinally (10.05m), its lateral distance (-4.17m) and lateral velocity (-7.27 m/s) suggest it's moving quickly away from the ego vehicle.  However, the relatively short distance and the fact it's still moving towards the ego longitudinally (-2.45 m/s) require continued monitoring.
