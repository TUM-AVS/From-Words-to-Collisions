### Safety analysis for timestep 0.9 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

**Assumptions and Clarifications:**

* The prompt mentions "ADJUSTED distances (adjusted_d_long and adjusted_d_lat)" but doesn't provide them. Therefore, the analysis below uses the provided `real distance` (DTClong and DTClat) values.  A truly accurate analysis requires these adjusted distances.
* TTC calculations assume constant relative velocity.  Since accelerations are provided, this assumption impacts accuracy, especially over longer durations.  A more precise TTC calculation would integrate the relative acceleration.
* Since no ego vehicle dimensions are given, MDC is approximated as the Euclidean distance (straight-line distance) between ego and obstacle at the last timestep (0.9 seconds).

### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 30618**
- Distance Risk reason: Located behind the ego vehicle and moving away longitudinally.  Lateral distance is also increasing.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: No risk of collision given current trajectories.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 30619**
- Distance Risk reason: Very close in both longitudinal (2.24m) and lateral (2.24m) dimensions and approaching the ego vehicle.
- Distance safety score: 1
- Time Risk reason:  Given the relative velocity and proximity, a collision is highly likely within the next second.
- Time safety score: 1
- Overall Risk score: 1

- **Obstacle ID: 30620**
- Distance Risk reason: Moderately close (around 10.65m in both directions) and approaching.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason:  Although approaching, more time to react compared to 30619.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3

- **Obstacle ID: 30623**
- Distance Risk reason: Moderately close (around 10.05m) and slowly approaching longitudinally. Moving away laterally.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: Lateral movement reduces collision risk; longitudinal approach is slow.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3

- **Obstacle ID: 30639**
- Distance Risk reason: Moderately close (around 10.59m in both directions) and approaching.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: Similar to 30620, some time to react but needs monitoring.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3


### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
  "CollisionObstacle": null,
  "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {
    "ObstacleID": "30619",
    "OverallRiskScore": "1"
  },
  "IsCollisionScenario": false,
  "Justification": "Obstacle 30619 poses an extreme risk with a very high likelihood of collision in the immediate future (within the next second) due to its proximity and velocity relative to the ego vehicle. Other obstacles are not on a direct collision course in the very near future, though they require monitoring."
