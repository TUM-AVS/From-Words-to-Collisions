To evaluate the risk level of potential collisions in the described autonomous driving scenario, let's assess each obstacle at the most recent timestep (0.9 seconds) using the adjusted distances and velocities, focusing on the trajectory and motion descriptions provided.

### Analysis of Each Obstacle:

#### Obstacle 30618 (Rear-left)
- **Adjusted Longitudinal Distance:** -13.50 m
- **Adjusted Lateral Distance:** 1.90 m
- **Relative Velocity (longitudinal):** -16.91 m/s
- **Motion:** Moving away longitudinally
- **Trajectory and Risk Assessment:**
  - The obstacle is moving away from the ego vehicle longitudinally.
  - Since this obstacle is moving further away, it poses no risk.
- **Risk Score:** 5 (No Risk)

#### Obstacle 30619 (Front-left)
- **Adjusted Longitudinal Distance:** 2.24 m
- **Adjusted Lateral Distance:** 2.13 m
- **Relative Velocity (longitudinal):** -12.95 m/s
- **Relative Velocity (lateral):** -0.84 m/s
- **Motion:** Driving toward ego car longitudinally and laterally
- **TTC Calculation:**
  - Longitudinal TTC: \( \frac{2.24 \, m}{12.95 \, m/s} \approx 0.17 \, s \)
  - Lateral TTC: Not meaningful since lateral distance is increasing.
- **MDC Calculation:**
  - MDC = \(\sqrt{(2.24 \, m)^2 + (2.13 \, m)^2} \approx 3.08 \, m\)
- **Trajectory and Risk Assessment:**
  - Trajectory indicates converging paths approaching the ego vehicle.
  - With TTC less than 0.5 seconds, this obstacle represents a high risk of collision.
- **Risk Score:** 1 (Extreme Risk)

#### Obstacle 30620 (Front-left)
- **Adjusted Longitudinal Distance:** 10.65 m
- **Adjusted Lateral Distance:** 18.00 m
- **Relative Velocity (longitudinal):** -3.83 m/s
- **Motion:** Driving toward ego car longitudinally and laterally
- **Trajectory and Risk Assessment:**
  - Both distances are substantial, and the obstacle is not rapidly closing in.
  - A probable no-risk scenario or very low risk exists due to the high distances.
- **Risk Score:** 5 (No Risk)

#### Obstacle 30623 (Front-right)
- **Adjusted Longitudinal Distance:** 10.05 m
- **Adjusted Lateral Distance:** -4.17 m
- **Relative Velocity (longitudinal):** -2.45 m/s
- **Profile:** Driving away laterally, longitudinal closing minimally
- **Trajectory and Risk Assessment:**
  - Lateral movement away from the ego vehicle reduces collision potential.
  - Far distances and diverging paths imply no imminent threat.
- **Risk Score:** 5 (No Risk)

#### Obstacle 30639 (Front-left)
- **Adjusted Longitudinal Distance:** 10.59 m
- **Adjusted Lateral Distance:** 6.80 m
- **Relative Velocity (longitudinal):** -3.83 m/s
- **Trajectory and Risk Assessment:**
  - Almost parallel path; risk minimal unless driven into the lane.
  - MDC > 5.0 meters reliably indicates no risk at adjusted dimensions.
- **Risk Score:** 5 (No Risk)

### Conclusion

In the most recent timestep, Obstacle 30619 presents an extreme risk due to both longitudinal approach within a dangerous TTC range and proximity. This qualifies the scenario as a potential collision situation due to high risk levels present.
