Both Ego and Obstacle 30611.0 are in the same lanelet (369.0) and moving in roughly the same direction (similar orientations).  The obstacle is behind the Ego vehicle, but the velocity of the obstacle is consistently higher than the Ego vehicle's velocity while both are decelerating.  This means the obstacle is closing the distance between them.

Analyzing the positions, we see the y-coordinates are getting closer over time.  While a collision isn't imminent in the next second, the trend suggests a high risk of collision if the current dynamics continue. The distance between the vehicles is decreasing and the obstacle is traveling at a higher speed while also decelrating faster than the ego vehicle which increases the likelihood of a possible collision . Therefore, I classify Obstacle 30611.0 as a High Risk (2).
