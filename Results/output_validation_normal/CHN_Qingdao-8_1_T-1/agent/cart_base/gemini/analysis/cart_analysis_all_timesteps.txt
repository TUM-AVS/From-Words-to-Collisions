Both Ego and Obstacle 30611.0 are in the same lanelet (369.0) and moving in roughly the same direction (similar orientations).  The obstacle is behind the Ego vehicle and closing the distance between them. Let's analyze the longitudinal distance:

* **t=0.1s:** Distance ≈ 24.5 meters
* **t=0.2s:** Distance ≈ 22.3 meters
* **t=0.3s:** Distance ≈ 20.2 meters
* **t=0.4s:** Distance ≈ 18.1 meters
* **t=0.5s:** Distance ≈ 16.1 meters
* **t=0.6s:** Distance ≈ 14.2 meters
* **t=0.7s:** Distance ≈ 12.3 meters
* **t=0.8s:** Distance ≈ 10.5 meters
* **t=0.9s:** Distance ≈ 8.8 meters

The distance is consistently decreasing. While the obstacle's deceleration is greater than the ego's, the closing rate is still concerning. Given the current trend, a collision or near collision within the next few seconds is highly likely if both vehicles maintain their current trajectories and deceleration rates. This warrants an "Extreme Risk" assessment.
