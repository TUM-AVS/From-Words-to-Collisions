At t=0.9s, the ego vehicle is at (709.9109, -1572.2399) with a velocity of 18.5037 and the obstacle 30611.0 is at (705.2101, -1554.0826) with a velocity of 19.1987. Both are in the same lanelet (369.0) and have similar orientations.

**Analysis and Calculations:**

1. **Longitudinal TTC:**  The obstacle is ahead of the ego vehicle in the same lanelet.  The relative longitudinal velocity is slightly negative (obstacle is moving faster), meaning the gap between the vehicles is decreasing.  The longitudinal distance is approximately 18.157 meters. Therefore, longitudinal TTC is approximately 18.157 meters / (19.1987 - 18.5037) meters/second â‰ˆ 28 seconds.

2. **Lateral TTC:**  Since both vehicles are in the same lane and have almost identical orientations, the lateral distance is small (4.7008 m), but not immediately dangerous.  A more precise lateral velocity difference is needed for a definitive lateral TTC, but it appears low risk for the immediate future.


3. **MDC (Minimum Distance to Collision):**  The MDC at t=0.9s is approximately 4.7008 meters.  This distance represents the lateral separation.

4. **Overall Risk Assessment:** Although the MDC is relatively small, both the longitudinal TTC and the trends in velocities and positions suggest that a collision is unlikely in the very near future.  

5. **Risk Scores:**
    * Position: 4 (Vehicles are somewhat close laterally, but longitudinal separation provides a buffer)
    * Orientation: 5 (Orientations are nearly identical, minimizing immediate lateral collision risk)
    * Velocity: 4 (The closing velocity is relatively small)
    * Acceleration: 5 (The accelerations do not indicate an imminent collision risk)

6. **Overall Risk Score:**  Based on the MDC, TTC and individual metric scores, the overall risk is currently low (3), trending towards medium (4) given the closing velocity is small. 

**Prediction:** While the current situation isn't critical, continuous monitoring is necessary.  If the obstacle continues to decelerate at its current rate, the risk will further decrease and ego can easily manage the distance to the leading obstacle without any aggressive maneuvers.
