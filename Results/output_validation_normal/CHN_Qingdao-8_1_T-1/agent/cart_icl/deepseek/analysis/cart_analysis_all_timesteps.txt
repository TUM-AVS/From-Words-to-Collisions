### Analysis:

1. **Relative Motion and Position**:
   - The ego vehicle and obstacle (ID: 30611) are in the same lanelet (369.0) and moving in the same direction.
   - The obstacle is ahead of the ego vehicle and decelerating faster than the ego vehicle (obstacle acceleration: -4.473 m/s² vs. ego acceleration: -1.7447 m/s² at 0.9s).
   - The longitudinal distance between the ego and the obstacle is decreasing over time (from ~19.67m at 0.1s to ~18.16m at 0.9s).

2. **Time to Collision (TTC)**:
   - Relative longitudinal velocity at 0.9s:  
     Obstacle velocity (19.1987 m/s) - Ego velocity (18.5037 m/s) = 0.695 m/s (approaching).  
     TTC = Distance (18.16m) / Relative velocity (0.695 m/s) ≈ 26.13s.  
     This indicates a very low immediate risk of collision.

3. **Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC)**:
   - The lateral distance is effectively 0 (same lanelet), but the longitudinal distance is large enough to avoid immediate risk.

4. **Risk Assessment**:
   - The obstacle is ahead and decelerating faster, but the relative velocity is small, and the distance is sufficient.  
   - **Overall Risk Score**: 4 (Low Risk) – Minimal risk, sufficient time to react.
