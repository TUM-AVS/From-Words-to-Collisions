At t=0.9s, the ego vehicle and obstacle 30611 are in the same lanelet (369). The obstacle is ahead of the ego vehicle and moving slower. Let's analyze the risk.

**Position Analysis:**

* Ego Position (x, y): (709.9109, -1572.2399)
* Obstacle 30611 Position (x, y): (705.2101, -1554.0826)
* Approximate Longitudinal Distance:  -18.1573 (obstacle is ahead)
* Approximate Lateral Distance: 4.7008

**Velocity Analysis:**

* Ego Velocity: 18.5037
* Obstacle 30611 Velocity: 19.1987
* Relative Velocity: 0.695 (obstacle is slightly faster.)

**TTC and MDC Estimation:**

Given the positions and velocities, a rough estimate of TTC (using longitudinal distance and relative velocity) is: 18.1573 / 0.695 â‰ˆ 26 seconds. This TTC value along with the lateral distance suggests a low risk, but we cannot confirm without precise relative velocity and angles which is missing to determine a precise MDC. Due to limited information about the shape of the vehicles, a precise MDC cannot be calculated based on the Cartesian coordinates available in this scenario.
Considering the lateral and longitudinal separation and the existing relative velocity, the risk appears low.

**Risk Assessment:**

Given the relatively large TTC, and the lateral separation, obstacle 30611 presents a low risk at this timestep. However, continuous monitoring is essential due to changing dynamics in the scenario, especially as their speeds appear to be converging and the ego is accelerating while the obstacle is decelerating at a much faster rate.
