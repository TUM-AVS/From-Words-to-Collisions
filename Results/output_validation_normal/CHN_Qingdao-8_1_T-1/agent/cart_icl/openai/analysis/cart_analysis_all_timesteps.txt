Upon analyzing the given scenario over multiple time steps for potential collision risk, I concluded the following:

### Overview Analysis
- **Ego Vehicle:** 
  - Over 0.9 seconds, the ego vehicle is decelerating from a velocity of 21.1373 to 18.5037 m/s. 
  - Its position is consistently moving through lanelet 369.0 with slight changes in orientation but generally maintains a roughly constant direction.
  
- **Obstacle 30611.0:**
  - This vehicle is also decelerating, from 22.7726 to 19.1987 m/s over the same period.
  - It remains on the same trajectory within lanelet 369.0, maintaining a close geographical approach to the ego vehicle.

### Detailed Time-to-Collision (TTC) and Distance Analysis
- **TTC and MDC Calculations:**
  - **Relative Position:**
    - At the most recent timestamp (0.9s), the obstacle is positioned at (705.2101, -1554.0826), and the ego is at (709.9109, -1572.2399).
  - **Longitudinal distance:**
    - Calculate the longitudinal position difference: \( 709.9109 - 705.2101 = 4.7008 \, m \).
  - **Longitudinal velocity difference:**
    - Difference in velocities at 0.9s: \( 18.5037 - 19.1987 = -0.695 \, m/s \) (obstacle is faster).
  - **TTC:**
    - Since the obstacle is ahead, calculate TTC (longitudinal): since the relative velocity is negative, this indicates the vehicles are moving away longitudinally.
  - **Lateral distance:**
    - Assessing the lateral separation using the y-coordinates: \( | -1572.2399 - (-1554.0826) | = 18.1573 \, m \).

### Risk Assessment
- There is a broad lateral separation of 18.1573 meters, which implies low lateral collision risk.
- Longitudinally, there's no immediate risk as the obstacle is moving slightly faster than the ego, meaning no imminent closing of gap.

### Conclusion
- Based on the low risk of collision implied by the continued separation, both laterally and longitudinally, and given the obstacle's deceleration, the overall risk is minimal.
  
**Risk Score Summary:**   
- Given the significant lateral distance and lack of imminent longitudinal proximity risk, both the ego vehicle and the obstacle maintain a negligible risk of collision at the current state.
