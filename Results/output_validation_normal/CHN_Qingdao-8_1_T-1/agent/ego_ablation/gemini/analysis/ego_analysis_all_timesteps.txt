At t=0.9s, obstacle 30611 is 14.25m ahead of the ego vehicle and moving away longitudinally at 0.69 m/s.  The lateral distance is 0.0m and although the lateral acceleration is -2.64 m/sÂ², the current lateral velocity is 0.0 m/s. Given the longitudinal movement away from the ego vehicle and the relatively large longitudinal distance, the risk of collision is negligible.
