At t=0.9s, obstacle 30611 is moving away from the ego vehicle with a longitudinal velocity of 0.69 m/s.  The longitudinal distance is 14.25 m and increasing. While there is some lateral acceleration (-2.64 m/sÂ²), the lateral velocity is 0.0 m/s and lateral distance is 0.0 m. This suggests the obstacle is directly ahead and not currently posing a collision risk.  Given the increasing distance and relatively low longitudinal velocity, the risk is negligible.
