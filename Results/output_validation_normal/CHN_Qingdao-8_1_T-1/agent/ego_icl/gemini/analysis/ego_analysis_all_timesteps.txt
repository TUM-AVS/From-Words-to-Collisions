Obstacle 30611 is in front of the ego vehicle and has been consistently moving away over the past 0.9 seconds.  At the last timestep (0.9 seconds), it is at a longitudinal distance of 14.25m and a lateral distance of 0.00m.  The lateral distance of 0.00m indicates alignment in the same lane, but not a collision. Since the obstacle is moving away longitudinally (0.69 m/s), the risk of collision is negligible.

TTC Calculation: Since the relative longitudinal velocity is positive (moving away), TTC is not applicable in this scenario.

MDC Calculation: Given the lateral alignment and increasing longitudinal distance, MDC > 5.0m.

Risk Assessment: Based on the increasing distance and separating velocity, the risk level for Obstacle 30611 is 5 (Negligible Risk).
