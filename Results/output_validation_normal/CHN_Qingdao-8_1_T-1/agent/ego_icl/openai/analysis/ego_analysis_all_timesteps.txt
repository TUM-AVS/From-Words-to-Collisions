### Analysis of Obstacle 30611
#### Obstacle Trajectory and Motion Description
- **Motion Description**: The obstacle is in front of the ego vehicle, moving away longitudinally. There is exact lateral alignment, but no collision indication as longitudinal distance is increasing.
  
#### Trajectory Analysis
- From 0.1 to 0.9 seconds, the longitudinal distance increased from 13.70 m to 14.25 m, indicating the obstacle is moving further away from the ego vehicle over time.
- The relative longitudinal velocity is consistently positive, with values decreasing from 1.76 m/s to 0.69 m/s, implying the rate at which the obstacle is moving away is slightly slowing down.
- Lateral velocity remains 0.00 m/s across all timestamps, confirming stable lateral alignment, not approaching.

#### Time-to-Collision (TTC) Calculation
- **Longitudinal Component**: Since the obstacle is moving away, there will be no collision, which translates to TTC being effectively infinite.
- **Lateral Component**: Lateral velocity is 0, hence not approaching the ego vehicle.

#### Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC) Calculation
- **Longitudinal MDC**: As the obstacle is increasing in distance, there is no risk of collision making MDC effectively greater than 5.0 meters.
- **Lateral MDC**: No lateral movement implies lateral MDC remains stable and non-threatening.

#### Risk Assessment
Given that the obstacle is moving away longitudinally (increasing distance and positive velocity), and there is no lateral movement, there is no significant risk posed by this obstacle. The applicable risk score is:

- **Risk Level**: 5 (Negligible Risk)

### Conclusion
Obstacles are assessed based on their calculated trajectories and proximity trends relative to the ego vehicle. In this case for obstacle 30611, there are no approaching threats identified:
