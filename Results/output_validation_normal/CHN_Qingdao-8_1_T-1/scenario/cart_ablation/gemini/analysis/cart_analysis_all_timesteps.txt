At t=0.9s, Ego (709.9109, -1572.2399) and Obstacle 30611.0 (705.2101, -1554.0826) are in the same lanelet (369.0).  The obstacle is behind the ego vehicle, but the distance is closing slightly over the observed timesteps.  However, both vehicles are decelerating. The relative velocity and distances don't suggest an immediate or certain collision within the next second or so.  The risk level is low (4 or 5), not 0 or 1.
