At t=0.9s, the ego vehicle is at (709.9109, -1572.2399) and the obstacle 30611.0 is at (705.2101, -1554.0826). Both are in the same lanelet (369.0) and have similar orientations.  The obstacle is behind the ego vehicle, but the distance is closing as the obstacle's velocity (19.1987) is higher than the ego's (18.5037).  While the obstacle's deceleration is much greater, the current trajectories suggest a potential collision or near miss in the next few timesteps.  This warrants an "Extreme Risk" assessment.

  },
  "ScenarioAnalysis": {
    "IsCollisionScenario": false,
    "Reasoning": "Obstacle 30611.0 poses an extreme risk due to its higher velocity and closing distance to the ego vehicle within the same lanelet, despite its greater deceleration.  Potential for collision or near miss in the very near future."
