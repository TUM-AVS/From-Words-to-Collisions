### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 30611.0
- Distance Risk reason: At the last timestep (0.9 seconds), the obstacle is approximately 4.7 meters ahead of the ego vehicle in the same lanelet. While the distance is not extremely close, the obstacle's and ego vehicle's consistent trajectory throughout the provided timeframe indicates a potential closing of this distance, representing a medium risk. Over the 0.9 seconds, the Y-coordinate difference has decreased from approximately 18 meters to 18 meters.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: Both the ego vehicle and the obstacle are moving in the same direction with similar orientations. However, the ego vehicle's velocity is consistently decreasing over the observed period (from 21.14 m/s to 18.50 m/s), while the obstacle also shows a decreasing velocity but at a faster deceleration rate(from 22.77 m/s to 19.20 m/s).  This trend indicates a moderate risk of collision if these deceleration rates continue.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3


### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. **Most critical obstacle:** Obstacle 30611.0 is the only obstacle identified within the same lanelet and relatively close proximity to the ego vehicle.

2. **Trajectory analysis:** Both the ego vehicle and the obstacle are moving in the same general direction (positive X, negative Y) and in the same lanelet. Both maintain a relatively consistent orientation with minor fluctuations.

3. **Relative positions, velocities, and accelerations:** The obstacle is ahead of the ego vehicle but the distance between them is slowly decreasing over time. The velocity of both is decreasing, but the obstacle is decelerating at a faster rate.

4. **Collision determination:** While the current state does not indicate an immediate collision, the current trajectories suggest a possible collision if the current trends continue.  Additional future data points are needed to determine if a collision becomes imminent.

5. **Reasoning:** The consistent trend of decreasing distance, combined with the deceleration pattern, raises concern. If these trends continue, the ego vehicle could collide with the obstacle within the next few seconds. Although the current risk level is medium, it is essential to continue monitoring the situation as it has the potential to escalate quickly.

### Summary in JSON Format:

{
    "CollisionObstacles": null,
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null,
    "ScenarioAnalysis": {
        "IsCollisionScenario": false,
        "Reasoning": "While no immediate collision is observed within the provided 1-second window, a risk of a future collision exists. Both the ego vehicle and Obstacle 30611.0 are traveling in the same lane, with the obstacle ahead. However, they are both decelerating, and the relative distance between them is decreasing over time. If these deceleration patterns and relative velocities continue, a collision may occur in the near future. Further data is needed to definitively determine if a collision is inevitable."
