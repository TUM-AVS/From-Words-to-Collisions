### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep:

### Obstacle Analysis:
- **Obstacle ID**: 30611.0
  - **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is in the same lanelet (369.0) as the ego vehicle and has been consistently ahead of the ego vehicle. The distance between the ego and the obstacle has been decreasing over time (from ~19.67m at 0.1s to ~18.16m at 0.9s). The relative distance is still significant but decreasing.
  - **Distance safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: The obstacle is decelerating faster (acceleration = -4.473) than the ego vehicle (acceleration = -1.7447), but its velocity (19.1987) is still higher than the ego's (18.5037). The relative velocity is decreasing, reducing the risk of collision.
  - **Time safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 3 (Medium Risk)

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. Both the ego and obstacle are in the same lanelet (369.0) and moving in the same direction.
2. The obstacle is ahead of the ego and decelerating faster than the ego.
3. The distance between them is decreasing but at a reducing rate due to the obstacle's higher deceleration.
4. No immediate collision risk, but the situation requires monitoring due to the decreasing distance.
