### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 30611.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 30611.0 is in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle and its position history shows it is relatively close and moving slightly slower.  At t=0.9s, the distance is approximately 18 meters.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: The relative velocity between the ego vehicle and Obstacle 30611.0 is decreasing, but still indicates potential for collision if deceleration isn't maintained.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3

- Obstacle ID: 30612.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 30612.0 is in a different lanelet and significantly further away (lateral and longitudinal separation), posing no immediate threat.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason:  Relative velocity and acceleration patterns for 30612.0 do not suggest a collision course given the lane separation.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
This is not a collision scenario. Although obstacle 30611.0 is relatively close and in the same lane, the current trajectories and decelerations suggest a medium risk, not an imminent collision.  No obstacles have a risk score of 0.

### Summary in JSON Format: 
```json
{
  "CollisionObstacles": [],
  "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null,
  "ScenarioAnalysis": {
    "IsCollisionScenario": false,
    "Reasoning": "No obstacle has a risk score of 0. Closest obstacle (30611.0) is assessed as medium risk (score 3) due to proximity and relative velocity, but the overall trend suggests increasing separation."
  }
