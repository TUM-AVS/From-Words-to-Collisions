### Obstacle Analysis:

#### Obstacle 30611.0:
- **Distance Risk reason**: Obstacle 30611.0 has been moving consistently in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle (369.0) with decreasing distance over time. At the last timestep (0.9s), the distance between the ego vehicle and Obstacle 30611 is approximately 18.1573 units. Given the relative proximity and decelerating trend, it poses a notable risk due to its close longitudinal proximity within the lane.
- **Distance safety score**: 2 (High Risk)
- **Time Risk reason**: The relative velocity is decreasing over time due to negative acceleration for both the ego vehicle and the obstacle. The TTC is short, indicating a potential collision in a short timeframe if trajectories remain unchanged.
- **Time safety score**: 2 (High Risk)
- **Overall Risk score**: 2 (High Risk)

#### Obstacle 30612.0:
- **Distance Risk reason**: Obstacle 30612.0 is located far away in a different lanelet (205.0) with a very stable trajectory. Its path over the timeframe indicates it is moving in a direction away from the ego vehicle.
- **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- **Time Risk reason**: The obstacle has minimal time risk due to a continuously high and stable velocity in a direction that does not intersect with the ego vehicleâ€™s path. No trend suggests collision convergence.
- **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- **Overall Risk score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
The scenario analysis reveals that:
- Obstacle 30611.0 presents a high risk due to its proximity and trajectory within the same lanelet, which converges towards the ego vehicle, combined with high velocity and deceleration rates.
- Obstacle 30612.0 is on a separate course and poses negligible risk.
- The scenario is not a collision scenario since no obstacle shows a complete absence of controllability (collision risk score 0), but Obstacle 30611.0 does introduce a relevant threat prompting precautionary measures.
