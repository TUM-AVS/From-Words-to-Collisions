Obstacle 30611 is moving away from the ego vehicle longitudinally, and although it's laterally aligned (lateral distance 0.0m), the lateral acceleration suggests it might be starting to move away laterally as well.  The longitudinal distance is increasing over time, and the relative longitudinal velocity is positive (moving away) but decreasing. This indicates a low risk of collision.
