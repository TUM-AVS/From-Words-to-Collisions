Obstacle 30611 is moving away from the ego vehicle with a longitudinal relative velocity of 0.69 m/s and a longitudinal distance of 14.25 m.  The lateral distance is 0.00 m, indicating either perfect alignment or an unknown lateral relationship. While the lateral acceleration is -2.64 m/sÂ², suggesting some lateral movement might occur, the current data doesn't indicate an immediate risk. Given the increasing longitudinal distance and relatively slow relative longitudinal velocity, the risk of collision is low.
