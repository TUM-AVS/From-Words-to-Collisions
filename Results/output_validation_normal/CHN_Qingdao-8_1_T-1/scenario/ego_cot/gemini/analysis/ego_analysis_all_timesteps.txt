### Safety analysis for timestep 0.9 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 30611
- Distance Risk reason:  At 0.9 seconds, Obstacle 30611 is 14.25m longitudinally and laterally away from the ego vehicle, located in front. While laterally the distance is significant, the longitudinal distance represents a safe margin. Additionally, the obstacle is moving away longitudinally.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Since the obstacle is moving away longitudinally, the TTC is theoretically infinite, indicating no risk of collision.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5


### Summary in JSON Format:
