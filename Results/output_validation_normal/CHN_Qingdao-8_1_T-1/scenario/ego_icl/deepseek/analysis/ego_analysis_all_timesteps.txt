### Obstacle-by-Obstacle Analysis

#### Obstacle 30611 (Most Recent Timestep: 0.9 seconds)
- **Position**: Front of ego car
- **Adjusted Distances**: 
  - Longitudinal: 14.25 m (raw distance, adjusted distance not provided but assumed similar)
  - Lateral: 0.00 m (exact alignment)
- **Relative Velocity**: 
  - Longitudinal: 0.69 m/s (moving away from ego)
  - Lateral: 0.00 m/s (no lateral movement)
- **Motion Description**: Obstacle is moving away longitudinally. Exact lateral alignment.
- **Trajectory Analysis**: 
  - Over the timesteps, the longitudinal distance increases from 13.70 m to 14.25 m, indicating the obstacle is moving away from the ego vehicle.
  - Lateral distance remains 0.00 m, but there is no lateral movement or convergence.

#### Time-to-Collision (TTC) Calculation
- **Longitudinal TTC**: 
  - Distance: 14.25 m
  - Relative Velocity: 0.69 m/s (moving away)
  - TTC = N/A (since the obstacle is moving away, no collision trajectory)
- **Lateral TTC**: 
  - Distance: 0.00 m (aligned)
  - Relative Velocity: 0.00 m/s
  - TTC = N/A (no movement)
- **Effective TTC**: Not applicable (no converging trajectories)

#### Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC) Calculation
- **Longitudinal MDC**: 14.25 m (distance is increasing)
- **Lateral MDC**: 0.00 m (aligned but no convergence)
- **Effective MDC**: 14.25 m (since lateral alignment is stable and longitudinal distance is large)

#### Risk Assessment
- **TTC Risk**: No Risk (5) - No converging trajectories.
- **MDC Risk**: No Risk (5) - MDC > 5.0 m.
- **Overall Risk**: No Risk (5) - The obstacle is moving away and poses no immediate threat.

### Trajectory Analysis Across Timesteps
- The obstacle consistently moves away from the ego vehicle longitudinally (distance increases from 13.70 m to 14.25 m over 0.9 seconds).
- Lateral alignment remains exact (0.00 m) but with no lateral movement or convergence.
- Relative velocity decreases slightly over time (from 1.76 m/s to 0.69 m/s), but the obstacle is still moving away.

### Conclusion
- No collision or extreme risk is present. The obstacle is moving away from the ego vehicle, and the lateral alignment does not indicate any convergence or collision risk.
