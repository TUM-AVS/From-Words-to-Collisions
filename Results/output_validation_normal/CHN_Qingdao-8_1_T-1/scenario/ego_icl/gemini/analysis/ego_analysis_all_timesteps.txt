Obstacle 30611 Analysis:

Trajectory Analysis: Over the observed time period (0.0s to 0.9s), Obstacle 30611 consistently remains in front of the ego vehicle and moves longitudinally away.  The lateral distance is consistently reported as 0.00m, indicating perfect lateral alignment. However, as explained in the instructions, this does not automatically mean a collision.  The longitudinal distance increases over time, clearly showing a diverging trajectory.

TTC and MDC Calculations at t=0.9s:

Given that the obstacle is moving away longitudinally, a classic TTC calculation (distance/relative_velocity) isn't meaningful for collision assessment in that dimension. The increasing distance confirms there is no longitudinal collision risk. Since the lateral distance is 0.0m and the obstacle remains perfectly aligned longitudinally, the MDC is considered to be equivalent to the lateral distance.  Since the relative velocity is 0 or not closing for the obstacle, there is no apparent converging trajectory, therefore there is no lateral risk.

Risk Assessment at t=0.9s:

* Longitudinal Risk: 5 (No Risk) - The obstacle is moving away from the ego vehicle.
* Lateral Risk: 5 (No Risk) - While laterally aligned, the obstacle is neither approaching nor diverging laterally.

Overall Risk Score: 5 (No Risk) - There is no imminent collision risk.

Collision Scenario Determination:

This is NOT a collision scenario. No obstacle exhibits a risk score of 0 or 1.
