### Obstacle Analysis

**Obstacle 30611:**

#### Trajectory Analysis:
- At **0.1 seconds**, the obstacle is 13.70m longitudinal, 0.00m lateral. It is moving away with velocities of 1.76 m/s longitudinally.
- At **0.9 seconds**, the obstacle is 14.25m longitudinal, 0.00m lateral. It continues to move away, now with a velocity of 0.69 m/s longitudinally. 

The obstacle has been consistently moving away from the ego vehicle across all observed timesteps, indicating diverging paths.

#### Most Recent Timestep (0.9 seconds) Analysis:
- **Adjusted Longitudinal Distance:** 14.25 m
- **Adjusted Lateral Distance:** 0.00 m
- **Relative Longitudinal Velocity:** 0.69 m/s (moving away)
- **Relative Lateral Velocity:** 0.00 m/s

#### Calculations:
- **Longitudinal TTC:** Not applicable as the relative velocity indicates the obstacle is moving away from the ego vehicle.
- **Lateral TTC:** Not applicable due to zero and non-converging lateral velocity.
- **Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC):** Since the obstacle is aligned laterally but moving away longitudinally with significant distance (+14.25 m and stable/increasing), MDC is determined by longitudinal distance and no crossing path is predicted in the near future.

#### Risk Assessment:
- Since the obstacle is moving away with increasing distance:
  - **Longitudinal Risk:** No Risk due to diverging trajectory
  - **Lateral Risk:** No Risk due to exact alignment and no converging trajectory
 
- **Overall Risk Score:** 5 (No Risk)

### Conclusion:
There is no collision or extreme risk scenario present with obstacle 30611, as its trajectory indicates it is moving away from the ego vehicle, thus not posing any risk of collision or immediate threat.
