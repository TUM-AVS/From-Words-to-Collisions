Here's the analysis and the JSON output:

**Analysis:**

The Ego vehicle (ID 800) is primarily moving along the x-axis and is located in lanelet 47629. Let's analyze the obstacles concerning their risk to the Ego vehicle.

* **Obstacle 200:** This obstacle is in a different lanelet (47627) and its y-coordinate remains significantly different from Ego's. It poses no immediate collision risk despite its proximity in terms of x-coordinate.  Risk Level: Low (4) or Negligible (5) depending on lanelet configurations which aren't provided.

* **Obstacle 201:** Located in lanelet 47625, it moves away from the Ego vehicle and does not present any risk. Risk Level: Negligible (5)

* **Obstacle 202:** This obstacle is in the same lanelet as the Ego vehicle (47629). Initially, it is behind the Ego vehicle but gradually approaches and is very close at 0.9 seconds (10.424, 0.60595) vs. Ego (24.6967, 0.2744). Given the current trajectories, there is a high risk of a collision in the near future if both vehicles maintain their speed and heading. Risk Level: High (2) or possibly Extreme (1) if we project trajectories a few more steps. 

* **Obstacle 203:** This obstacle is in the same lanelet as Ego (47629) but consistently remains far ahead. It poses no collision risk. Risk Level: Negligible (5)

* **Obstacle 204:** This obstacle is in the same lanelet as Ego (47629). It starts behind the Ego vehicle and moves closer, but its y-coordinate is only slightly offset. However, its movement pattern doesn't suggest an immediate collision.  Risk Level: Medium (3) to Low (4)

**Conclusion:**

Obstacle 202 shows the highest risk of collision with the Ego vehicle due to its trajectory in the same lane and closing distance. It needs closer monitoring.
