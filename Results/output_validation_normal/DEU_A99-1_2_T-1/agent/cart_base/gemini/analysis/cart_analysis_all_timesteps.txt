Obstacles 202 and 204, which share the same lanelet (47629.0) as the ego vehicle, pose the most significant risk. Obstacle 202's y-coordinate changes from -0.031342 at t=0.1s to 0.60595 at t=0.9s, indicating movement towards the ego vehicle's y-coordinate (increasing from 0.0025 at t=0.1s to 0.2744 at t=0.9s). Similarly, Obstacle 204 exhibits a similar pattern, moving from a negative y-coordinate (-0.24838 at t=0.1s) to a positive one (0.41615 at t=0.9s). Both obstacles are also approaching the ego vehicle in the x-coordinate. Given their continuous approach and shared lanelet, a collision with either Obstacle 202 or 204 is increasingly likely.

Obstacle 200 is in a different lanelet (47627.0). Although its x and y positions are approaching the ego vehicle's, the different lanelets suggest a lower risk unless there's a lane change maneuver by either vehicle, which isn't indicated in the provided data.

Obstacle 201 is also in a different lanelet (47625.0) and moving away from the ego vehicle in the x-coordinate, posing minimal risk.

Obstacle 203 shares the same lanelet as the ego vehicle but is moving further away in the x-coordinate, thus posing a low risk.

Based on the trajectories and lanelets, Obstacles 202 and 204 present the highest risk of collision with the ego vehicle.  Obstacle 202 seems slightly more concerning due to its faster rate of approach to the ego vehicle's position. Thus, a High Risk (2) rating seems appropriate for Obstacle 202, and a Medium Risk (3) would suffice for Obstacle 204.
