At t=0.9s, the ego vehicle is at (24.6967, 0.2744) with a velocity of 27.185 m/s and an acceleration of -0.0115 m/sÂ².  Let's analyze each obstacle:

* **Obstacle 200:** Located in a different lanelet (47627) at (25.2136, 4.8487). While the x-coordinate is slightly ahead of the ego vehicle, the significant lateral distance suggests a low risk.  Further calculations are needed to precisely determine TTC and MDC, but a preliminary assessment suggests no immediate concern.

* **Obstacle 201:**  Located in a different lanelet (47625) at (3.9237, 8.0008). This obstacle poses no immediate risk due to the substantial lateral separation.

* **Obstacle 202:** Located in the same lanelet (47629) at (10.424, 0.60595). This obstacle is significantly behind the ego vehicle and also has a lateral offset.  Low risk.

* **Obstacle 203:** Located in the same lanelet (47629) at (52.6901, 1.7742).  This obstacle is significantly ahead of the ego vehicle.  While in the same lanelet, the distance suggests low risk.

* **Obstacle 204:** Located in the same lanelet (47629) at (3.5574, 0.41615). This obstacle is significantly behind the ego vehicle and has a small lateral offset.  Low risk.


Based on the provided data, no obstacle presents an immediate collision risk at t=0.9s. All obstacles are either in different lanelets with significant lateral separation or in the same lanelet but at safe distances.  It's crucial to continue monitoring these obstacles, particularly 202 and 204 which are in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle, to assess future risk as the scenario evolves.  More data points, especially regarding the dimensions of the vehicles and lanelets, would enable more precise TTC and MDC calculations.
