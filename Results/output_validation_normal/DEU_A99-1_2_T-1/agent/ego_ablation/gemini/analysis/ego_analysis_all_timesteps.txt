At the most recent timestep (0.9 seconds):

* **Obstacle 200:** Located to the left and moving away laterally, posing no immediate risk.
* **Obstacle 201:**  Located behind and to the left, moving away laterally, longitudinal distance still significant and relative velocity high. No immediate collision risk but requires monitoring due to closing longitudinal distance.
* **Obstacle 202:** Located directly behind the ego vehicle and relatively close (-9.76m). The longitudinal relative velocity is positive (0.81 m/s), indicating that it is getting closer.  This obstacle presents the highest risk.
* **Obstacle 203:** Located in front and moving further away longitudinally, posing no risk.
* **Obstacle 204:** Located behind at a greater distance than 202 and moving relatively slowly. Poses less risk than 202 but needs monitoring.

Obstacle 202 requires the most immediate attention due to the combination of proximity and closing longitudinal relative velocity and zero lateral offset. Obstacle 201 and 204 requires monitoring as they are closing but not as severe as 202.
