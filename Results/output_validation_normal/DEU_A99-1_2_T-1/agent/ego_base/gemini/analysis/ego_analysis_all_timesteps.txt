At t=0.9s:
- Obstacle 200: Located to the left, moving away laterally, posing no immediate risk.
- Obstacle 201: Approaching from the rear-left, but still at a safe distance.  Lateral movement is away from ego.
- Obstacle 202:  Behind the ego and slowly gaining longitudinally. Requires monitoring.
- Obstacle 203: In front, moving away, and not a risk.
- Obstacle 204:  Behind the ego and slowly gaining longitudinally. Requires monitoring, but less critical than 202 due to larger longitudinal distance.

Obstacles 202 and 204 are approaching from behind but their relative longitudinal velocities are low and the distances are not yet critically small. This warrants a medium risk assessment for now, as they could become high risk if the relative velocity increases or if the ego vehicle brakes suddenly.
