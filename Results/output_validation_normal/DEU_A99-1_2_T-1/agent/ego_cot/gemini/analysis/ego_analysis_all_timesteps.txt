### Safety analysis for timestep 0.9s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

**Assumptions and Clarifications:**

* **Missing Adjusted Distances:** The provided scenario lacks adjusted longitudinal and lateral distances (adjusted_d_long, adjusted_d_lat).  This is crucial for accurate TTC and MDC calculations. I will proceed with the analysis using the provided *real* distances (longitudinal and lateral), but the results will be less reliable.  **It is strongly recommended to include adjusted distances for a proper safety assessment.**
* **TTC Calculation:** TTC is calculated as distance / relative velocity.  If the relative velocity is away from the ego vehicle (e.g., positive longitudinal velocity for an obstacle in front), TTC is considered infinite (no collision risk). If the distance is zero, TTC is also zero and implies a collision.
* **MDC Calculation:**  Since adjusted distances are missing, MDC will be approximated using the *real* minimum distance observed in the provided timesteps.  This is a coarse approximation.


### Obstacle Analysis:

**- Obstacle ID: 200**
- Distance Risk reason: Located to the left of the ego vehicle with near-zero longitudinal and lateral distances. This suggests a very close proximity.
- Distance safety score: 2 (High Risk)
- Time Risk reason: The obstacle is moving away laterally to the left, reducing the risk of collision in that direction, although the near-zero real distances still indicate a current high risk.
- Time safety score: 3 (Medium Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 2 (High Risk)

**- Obstacle ID: 201**
- Distance Risk reason: Located behind and to the left of the ego vehicle, at a substantial distance.
- Distance safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
- Time Risk reason:  Approaching the ego vehicle longitudinally from behind although moving away laterally to the left. The closing longitudinal speed needs further consideration.
- Time safety score: 3 (Medium Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 3 (Medium Risk)

**- Obstacle ID: 202**
- Distance Risk reason:  Behind the ego vehicle at a moderate distance.
- Distance safety score: 3 (Medium Risk)
- Time Risk reason: Driving toward the ego car from behind, increasing risk longitudinally.
- Time safety score: 2 (High Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 2 (High Risk)

**- Obstacle ID: 203**
- Distance Risk reason: In front of the ego vehicle at a substantial distance.
- Distance safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- Time Risk reason: Moving away from the ego vehicle longitudinally.
- Time safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 5 (Negligible Risk)

**- Obstacle ID: 204**
- Distance Risk reason: Behind the ego vehicle at a moderate distance.
- Distance safety score: 3 (Medium Risk)
- Time Risk reason: Driving toward the ego vehicle from behind, increasing risk longitudinally.
- Time safety score: 2 (High Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 2 (High Risk)
