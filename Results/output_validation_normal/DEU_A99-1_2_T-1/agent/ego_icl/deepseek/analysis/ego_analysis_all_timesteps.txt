Let me analyze each obstacle at the most recent timestep (0.9 seconds):

1. Obstacle 200 (Left of ego):
   - Longitudinal: 0.00m (exact alignment), moving away at 2.81m/s
   - Lateral: 2.95m, moving away at 0.27m/s
   - MDC: 2.95m (lateral distance increasing)
   - TTC: Not applicable (distances increasing)
   - Risk: 5 (Negligible - moving away in both dimensions)

2. Obstacle 201 (Rear-left):
   - Longitudinal: -16.11m (behind), closing at 7.81m/s
   - Lateral: 6.52m, moving away at 0.34m/s
   - MDC: 6.52m (lateral distance increasing)
   - TTC (longitudinal): 16.11/7.81 = 2.06s
   - Risk: 3 (Medium - based on longitudinal TTC)

3. Obstacle 202 (Behind):
   - Longitudinal: -9.76m (behind), closing at 0.81m/s
   - Lateral: 0.00m (exact alignment)
   - MDC: 9.76m (longitudinal distance)
   - TTC: 9.76/0.81 = 12.05s
   - Risk: 5 (Negligible - slow approach rate)

4. Obstacle 203 (Front):
   - Longitudinal: 23.51m (ahead), moving away at 0.81m/s
   - Lateral: 0.00m (exact alignment)
   - MDC: 23.51m
   - TTC: Not applicable (moving away)
   - Risk: 5 (Negligible)

5. Obstacle 204 (Behind):
   - Longitudinal: -16.62m (behind), closing at 0.81m/s
   - Lateral: 0.00m (exact alignment)
   - MDC: 16.62m
   - TTC: 16.62/0.81 = 20.52s
   - Risk: 5 (Negligible - slow approach rate)

Trajectory Analysis:
- Obstacle 201 shows the most concerning trajectory with rapid longitudinal closing (7.81m/s)
- All other obstacles either maintain safe distances or are moving away
- No obstacles show collision or extreme risk conditions
