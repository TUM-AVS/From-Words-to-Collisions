Obstacle 200 (Left):
- Trajectory: Consistently to the left of the ego vehicle and moving further away laterally. Longitudinal alignment is maintained throughout.
- At t=0.9s: Lateral distance = 2.95m, Longitudinal distance = 0.00m, Lateral velocity = 0.27 m/s (moving away). Longitudinal velocity = 2.81 m/s.
- TTC (Lateral): Not applicable as obstacle is moving away laterally.
- MDC:  Primarily lateral distance (2.95m) as the obstacle maintains longitudinal alignment.
- Risk: 4 (Low Risk) due to lateral separation and diverging lateral trajectory, despite longitudinal alignment.

Obstacle 201 (Rear-Left):
- Trajectory: Approaching from behind and slightly to the left, but also moving further away laterally.
- At t=0.9s: Longitudinal distance = -16.11m, Lateral distance = 6.52m, Longitudinal velocity = 7.81 m/s (approaching), Lateral velocity = 0.34 m/s (moving away).
- TTC (Longitudinal): 16.11m / 7.81 m/s ≈ 2.06s
- MDC: Primarily longitudinal as obstacle is approaching from rear (-16.11m). Lateral distance also significant (6.52 m and increasing).
- Risk: 3 (Medium Risk) due to longitudinal approach from rear although lateral separation is significant.


Obstacle 202 (Behind):
- Trajectory: Approaching from directly behind the ego vehicle, maintaining lateral alignment.
- At t=0.9s: Longitudinal distance = -9.76m, Lateral distance = 0.00m, Longitudinal velocity = 0.81 m/s (approaching), Lateral velocity = 0.23 m/s.
- TTC (Longitudinal): 9.76m / 0.81 m/s ≈ 12.05s
- MDC: Primarily Longitudinal (-9.76m). Lateral distance is 0.0m but not colliding, obstacle moving away laterally.
- Risk: 4 (Low risk) due to longitudinal distance and slow closing velocity.


Obstacle 203 (Front):
- Trajectory: Moving further ahead of the ego vehicle, maintaining lateral alignment.
- At t=0.9s: Longitudinal distance = 23.51m, Lateral distance = 0.00m, Longitudinal velocity = 0.81 m/s (moving away), Lateral velocity = 0.23 m/s.
- TTC (Longitudinal): Not applicable (moving away).
- MDC: Primarily Longitudinal (23.51m).
- Risk: 5 (Negligible Risk) due to increasing longitudinal distance and no lateral movement.

Obstacle 204 (Behind):
- Trajectory: Approaching from directly behind, maintaining lateral alignment.
- At t=0.9s: Longitudinal distance = -16.62m, Lateral distance = 0.00m, Longitudinal velocity = 0.81 m/s (approaching), Lateral velocity = 0.23 m/s.
- TTC (Longitudinal): 16.62 / 0.81 ≈ 20.5s
- MDC: Primarily Longitudinal (-16.62m).
- Risk: 4 (Low risk) due to longitudinal distance and slow closing speed, despite lateral alignment.
