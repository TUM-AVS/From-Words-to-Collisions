At t=0.9s, Ego is in lanelet 47629.0 at (24.6967, 0.2744).

Obstacle 202 is in the same lanelet at (10.424, 0.60595).  Given the relatively small lateral distance and Ego's straight trajectory, this presents a medium risk (but not extreme/collision).

Obstacle 204 is also in the same lanelet at (3.5574, 0.41615). Similar to 202, it's a medium risk but not imminent.

Obstacle 203 is further ahead in the same lanelet and poses no immediate risk.

Obstacles 200 and 201 are in different lanelets and don't present an immediate collision risk.
