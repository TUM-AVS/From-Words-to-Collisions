### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep:

### Obstacle Analysis:

#### Obstacle ID: 200.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: Located in lanelet 47627.0 (adjacent to ego's lanelet 47629.0). Y-coordinate difference is ~4.57m, indicating lateral separation. Over time, the obstacle is moving parallel to the ego but maintains a safe lateral distance.
- **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
- **Time Risk reason**: Relative velocity is ~2.8 m/s (ego: 27.185 m/s, obstacle: 30.0 m/s). TTC is high due to lateral separation and parallel motion.
- **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
- **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low Risk)

#### Obstacle ID: 201.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: Located in lanelet 47625.0 (not overlapping with ego's lanelet). Y-coordinate difference is ~7.73m, indicating significant lateral separation. Moving away from ego over time.
- **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- **Time Risk reason**: Relative velocity is ~7.8 m/s (ego: 27.185 m/s, obstacle: 35.0 m/s). Moving away with increasing distance.
- **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- **Overall Risk score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)

#### Obstacle ID: 202.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: Located in the same lanelet (47629.0) as ego. X-coordinate difference is ~14.27m (ego ahead). Over time, the distance is increasing as ego is faster.
- **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- **Time Risk reason**: Relative velocity is ~-0.8 m/s (ego: 27.185 m/s, obstacle: 28.0 m/s). Obstacle is slightly faster but distance is increasing due to initial separation.
- **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- **Overall Risk score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)

#### Obstacle ID: 203.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: Located in the same lanelet (47629.0) as ego. X-coordinate difference is ~27.99m (obstacle ahead). Over time, the distance is increasing as obstacle is slightly faster.
- **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- **Time Risk reason**: Relative velocity is ~0.8 m/s (ego: 27.185 m/s, obstacle: 28.0 m/s). Obstacle is slightly faster but distance is large.
- **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- **Overall Risk score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)

#### Obstacle ID: 204.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: Located in the same lanelet (47629.0) as ego. X-coordinate difference is ~21.14m (ego ahead). Over time, the distance is increasing as ego is faster.
- **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- **Time Risk reason**: Relative velocity is ~-0.8 m/s (ego: 27.185 m/s, obstacle: 28.0 m/s). Obstacle is slightly faster but distance is increasing due to initial separation.
- **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- **Overall Risk score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. **Lanelet Analysis**: Ego is in lanelet 47629.0. Obstacles 202, 203, and 204 are in the same lanelet but are either ahead or behind with increasing separation.
2. **Trajectory Trends**: All obstacles are moving parallel to the ego with stable velocities. No sudden direction changes or accelerations observed.
3. **Collision Check**: No obstacles are on a collision course. The closest obstacle (200.0) is in an adjacent lanelet with safe lateral separation.
4. **Conclusion**: This is not a collision scenario. All obstacles pose negligible or low risk.
