### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 200
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is in a different lanelet and poses no immediate threat. The distance and trajectories suggest no imminent collision.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: The obstacle's constant velocity and differing lanelet mean no time-related risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 201
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is in a different lanelet and moving away from the ego vehicle.  No collision risk based on current trajectories.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: The obstacle is moving away, further reducing any time-related risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 202
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is in the same lanelet but far enough ahead and moving at a similar speed, reducing collision risk.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Similar velocities minimize the risk over time. The trajectory suggests no immediate collision risk.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- Obstacle ID: 203
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle is in the same lanelet and far ahead, posing no immediate risk.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: The position and consistent velocity suggest no immediate time-based risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 204
- Distance Risk reason: Although in the same lanelet and closer than 202 and 203, the trajectory suggests it's moving away.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason:  The current trajectory and velocities reduce risk over the short term.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4


### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
No obstacle presents an immediate collision risk. All obstacles are either in different lanelets or moving in a way that minimizes risk.  The ego vehicle's trajectory doesn't intersect with any obstacle's in the immediate future based on the provided data. This is not a collision scenario.

### Summary in JSON Format:

{
  "CollisionObstacles": null,
  "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null,
  "ScenarioAnalysis": {
    "IsCollisionScenario": false,
    "Reasoning": "No obstacles are on a collision course with the ego vehicle. All obstacles are either in different lanelets or maintaining a safe distance and velocity relative to the ego vehicle."
