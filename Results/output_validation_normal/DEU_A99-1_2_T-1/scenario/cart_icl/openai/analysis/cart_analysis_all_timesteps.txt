### Obstacle Analysis:

#### Obstacle 200:
- **Distance Risk Reason**: The obstacle is in lanelet 47627.0 and has maintained a parallel trajectory but is not in the ego's path. It closes the gap slightly but remains laterally offset.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 4
- **Time Risk Reason**: Though its speed is higher than the ego, it remains in a different lanelet, reducing the collision probability.
- **Time Safety Score**: 4
- **Overall Risk Score**: 4

#### Obstacle 201:
- **Distance Risk Reason**: Positioned in a different lanelet with a straight trajectory maintaining consistent separation.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 5
- **Time Risk Reason**: Constant velocity and direction. No immediate threat.
- **Time Safety Score**: 5
- **Overall Risk Score**: 5

#### Obstacle 202:
- **Distance Risk Reason**: Shares lanelet with ego and has steadily approached from behind through the sequence.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 2
- **Time Risk Reason**: Matching the speed closely, requiring the ego to maintain a higher deceleration to avoid collision.
- **Time Safety Score**: 2
- **Overall Risk Score**: 2

#### Obstacle 203:
- **Distance Risk Reason**: Moving in the same lanelet but maintaining a safe separation distance.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 4
- **Time Risk Reason**: Constant speed parallel to the ego without notable convergence risks.
- **Time Safety Score**: 4
- **Overall Risk Score**: 4

#### Obstacle 204:
- **Distance Risk Reason**: Approaching the ego's trajectory from the side but still retains some lateral distance.
- **Distance Safety Score**: 3
- **Time Risk Reason**: Though velocity slightly higher, its relative lateral and longitudinal distance offers reaction time.
- **Time Safety Score**: 3
- **Overall Risk Score**: 3

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
The analysis indicates there is no collision scenario. The ego vehicle and obstacles have been maintaining adequate separation, and the adjusting trajectories diminish immediate collision threats. Obstacles primarily in lane 47627.0 and 47625.0 are not aligned for a collision with the ego vehicle in 47629.0. Ego's decelerating motion combined with the maintained distance suggests manageable risks.
