Obstacle 200: This obstacle is to the left of the ego vehicle and is moving away laterally. It poses no immediate risk.

Obstacle 201: Located behind and to the left, this obstacle is approaching the ego vehicle longitudinally but moving away laterally.  The lateral movement reduces risk, but the longitudinal approach requires monitoring.

Obstacle 202: This obstacle is directly behind the ego vehicle and closing in longitudinally.  The small lateral relative velocity suggests it may not be perfectly aligned, but it's still a concern.

Obstacle 203: Positioned in front of the ego vehicle, this obstacle is moving away longitudinally and poses no risk.

Obstacle 204:  Similar to Obstacle 202, this one is behind the ego and approaching longitudinally.  Its small lateral velocity also suggests imperfect alignment but requires attention.
