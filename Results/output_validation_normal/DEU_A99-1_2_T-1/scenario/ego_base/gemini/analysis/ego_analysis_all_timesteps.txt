At t=0.9s, Obstacle 201 is approaching the ego vehicle from behind at a high longitudinal velocity (7.81 m/s) while also moving laterally away at a slower rate (0.34 m/s). However, it is still a considerable distance away (-16.11m longitudinal, 6.52m lateral).  Obstacles 202 and 204 are also behind the ego vehicle and slowly approaching longitudinally, but their distances and velocities don't suggest an immediate risk. Obstacle 200 is moving alongside the ego vehicle and poses no risk. Obstacle 203 is in front of the ego car and moving away, presenting no risk.  No obstacle presents an immediate collision risk.

**Risk Levels and Definitions:**
<Collision (Score: 0)>: Actual collision has occurred or is unavoidable within the next timestep.
<Extreme Risk (Score: 1)>: Immediate collision or very high likelihood of impact. Urgent action is required.
<High Risk (Score: 2)>: Close to collision or highly probable collision path. Needs prompt attention and quick manoeuvring.
<Medium Risk (Score: 3)>: Moderate collision risk but manageable with timely reactions and proper strategies.
<Low Risk (Score: 4)>: Minimal collision risk. The situation is controllable with sufficient time to react.
<Negligible Risk (Score: 5)>: No significant collision risk. Obstacles are either moving away or far enough not to interfere.
