### Safety analysis for timestep 0.9 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

**Assumptions and Clarifications:**

* **Missing Adjusted Distances:** The prompt emphasizes using *adjusted* distances (`adjusted_d_long`, `adjusted_d_lat`). However, these values are *not provided* in the scenario context.  Therefore, the analysis will be based on the *raw* `DTClong` and `DTClat` values, acknowledging that this reduces the accuracy of the risk assessment.  It's *crucial* to provide these adjusted distances for a reliable safety analysis.
* **TTC Calculation:** Since acceleration is relatively small and changes over time, a simplified TTC calculation will be used, assuming constant velocity: `TTC = Distance / Relative Velocity`.  If accurate acceleration profiles were available, a more sophisticated calculation would be necessary.
* **Lateral Risk:** Purely lateral movement, without longitudinal closure, is considered less risky unless extremely close.


### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 200**
    - Distance Risk reason: Located to the left of the ego vehicle with zero longitudinal distance and zero lateral distance, but moving away laterally. Assuming a vehicle width of approximately 1.8 meters, and the raw lateral distance is zero, a collision risk exists.  There is either slow lateral movement causing the sensor to still read zero lateral distance for a moment while very slightly overlapping, or the sensor has some error, as the lateral velocity shows the object is pulling away to the left. 
    - Distance safety score: 2
    - Time Risk reason:  The lateral movement is away from the ego vehicle.  However, without the adjusted distances or vehicle dimensions, there is a potential for sideswipe.
    - Time safety score: 2 
    - Overall Risk score: 2 (High Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 201**
    - Distance Risk reason: Located rear-left and relatively far. No immediate danger. The raw distance indicates a moderate risk if the ego vehicle were to aggressively move diagonally backwards and to the left. The adjusted distance, however, is needed to understand the precise separation.
    - Distance safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
    - Time Risk reason:  While approaching, the relative lateral velocity indicates it's moving further left. The adjusted distance, is needed to assess the risk from the relative longitudinal velocity as the longitudinal acceleration is approaching zero.
    - Time safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
    - Overall Risk score: 4 (Low Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 202**
    - Distance Risk reason: Located behind and relatively close.  Poses a moderate risk if the ego vehicle were to brake suddenly.
    - Distance safety score: 3 (Medium Risk)
    - Time Risk reason: Longitudinal relative velocity is fairly low and the longitudinal relative acceleration is nearly zero. Assuming vehicle lengths of 4 meters, and considering the raw distances provided (approximately 10 meters longitudinal and 10 meters lateral), a collision risk exists.
    - Time safety score: 3 (Medium Risk)
    - Overall Risk score: 3 (Medium Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 203**
    - Distance Risk reason: Located far ahead and moving further away. No risk.
    - Distance safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
    - Time Risk reason: Moving away longitudinally. No risk.
    - Time safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
    - Overall Risk score: 5 (Negligible Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 204**
    - Distance Risk reason: Located behind and relatively far from the ego vehicle. The raw distance suggests some risk if the ego vehicle brakes heavily or reverses.
    - Distance safety score: 3 (Medium Risk)
    - Time Risk reason: Longitudinal relative velocity is fairly low and the longitudinal relative acceleration is nearly zero. Assuming vehicle lengths of 4 meters, and considering the raw distances provided (approximately 17 meters longitudinal and 17 meters lateral), a collision risk exists.
    - Time safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
    - Overall Risk score: 4 (Low Risk)


### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
  "CollisionObstacle": null,
  "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {
    "ObstacleID": "200",
    "OverallRiskScore": "2"
  },
  "IsCollisionScenario": false,  
  "Justification": "Obstacle 200 poses a high risk due to its proximity and lateral movement, although it seems to be moving away. The lack of adjusted distances prevents definitive collision confirmation, but a high risk warrants attention and potential evasive action. No other obstacle presents an immediate collision risk based on current data, even though some obstacles are close from the back."
