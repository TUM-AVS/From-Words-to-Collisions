### Obstacle-by-Obstacle Analysis:

#### Obstacle 200
- **Position and Movement:**
  - Adjusted Distance: Longitudinal = 0.00 m, Lateral = 2.95 m
  - Relative Velocity: Longitudinal = 2.81 m/s, Lateral = 0.27 m/s
  - Motion: Exact longitudinal alignment; moving away laterally
- **Risk Assessment:**
  - MDC: Primarily determined by lateral distance, which is increasing.
  - MDC = 2.95 m (medium risk, considering the trajectory is diverging)
  - TTC (Longitudinal): Not applicable as the obstacle is moving away.
  - Risk Level: 3 (Medium Risk)

#### Obstacle 201
- **Position and Movement:**
  - Adjusted Distance: Longitudinal = -16.11 m, Lateral = 6.52 m
  - Relative Velocity: Longitudinal = 7.81 m/s, Lateral = 0.34 m/s
  - Motion: Driving toward the ego car; moving away laterally
- **Risk Assessment:**
  - MDC: Longitudinal distance is large and obstacle is significantly leftward.
  - MDC = Longitudinal = 16.11 m (Low Risk)
  - TTC (Longitudinal): 16.11 / 7.81 ≈ 2.06 seconds (Medium Risk)
  - Risk Level: 3 (Medium Risk)

#### Obstacle 202
- **Position and Movement:**
  - Adjusted Distance: Longitudinal = -9.76 m, Lateral = 0.00 m
  - Relative Velocity: Longitudinal = 0.81 m/s, Lateral = 0.23 m/s
  - Motion: Driving toward the ego car; exact lateral alignment
- **Risk Assessment:**
  - MDC = Lateral = 0.00 m, indicating a potential collision scenario if longitudinally aligned.
  - TTC (Longitudinal): 9.76 / 0.81 ≈ 12.05 seconds (Long-term, non-imminent)
  - Risk Level: 3 (Medium Risk)
  
#### Obstacle 203
- **Position and Movement:**
  - Adjusted Distance: Longitudinal = 23.51 m, Lateral = 0.00 m
  - Relative Velocity: Longitudinal = 0.81 m/s, Lateral = 0.23 m/s
  - Motion: Moving away longitudinally; exact lateral alignment
- **Risk Assessment:**
  - MDC = 23.51 m (No risk due to increasing distance)
  - TTC (Longitudinal): Not applicable as obstacle is moving away.
  - Risk Level: 5 (No Risk)

#### Obstacle 204
- **Position and Movement:**
  - Adjusted Distance: Longitudinal = -16.62 m, Lateral = 0.00 m
  - Relative Velocity: Longitudinal = 0.81 m/s, Lateral = 0.23 m/s
  - Motion: Driving toward the ego car; exact lateral alignment
- **Risk Assessment:**
  - MDC: Exact alignment longitudinally with small negative distance but slow closure rate.
  - TTC (Longitudinal): 16.62 / 0.81 ≈ 20.52 seconds (Non-critical closeness)
  - Risk Level: 5 (No Risk)

### Conclusion:
- No obstacles present extreme risk (Risk Level 1) or actual collision risk, as none have MDC < 0.5 m or TTC very low or negative with converging paths.
- Overall, this scenario is not deemed a collision scenario as interpreted from all given data.
