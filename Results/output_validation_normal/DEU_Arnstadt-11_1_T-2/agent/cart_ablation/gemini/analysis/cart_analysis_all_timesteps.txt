Both Ego and Obstacle 20036.0 are in the same lanelet (1063.0) and appear to be moving in roughly the same direction (positive x, negative y).  Analyzing the provided positions over time, the y-coordinates are converging. While the x-coordinate of the obstacle is consistently ahead of the ego vehicle, the difference in their y-coordinates is decreasing significantly over the observed time steps.  This suggests a potential rear-end collision if this trend continues. Since we only have a short time horizon and no information about lane changes or future actions, it's difficult to definitively categorize the risk as an *immediate* collision (risk score 1). However, the closing distance warrants classifying it as a high risk.
