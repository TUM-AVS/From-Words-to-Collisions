The ego vehicle and obstacle 20036.0 are in the same lanelet (1063.0).  Analyzing the positions over time reveals that the obstacle is ahead of the ego vehicle and moving slightly slower. However, the x-coordinates are converging, meaning the ego vehicle might be approaching the obstacle. The y-coordinates are also converging, but much faster and the ego has higher acceleration.  Although the ego vehicle is decelerating, the rate of deceleration is not enough to completely rule out a potential collision within a short timeframe, warranting at least a high risk assessment. The distance between them is decreasing over time.
