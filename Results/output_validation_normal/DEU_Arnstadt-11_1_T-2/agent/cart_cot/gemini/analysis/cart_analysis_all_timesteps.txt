At t=0.9s, the ego vehicle is at (7.6413, -90.1602) with a velocity of 8.8674 and the obstacle (ID: 20036.0) is at (9.5622, -67.8587) with a velocity of 12.6206.  Both are in the same lanelet (1063.0).

**Analysis:**

1. **Lateral Distance:** The lateral distance between the ego and obstacle is approximately |7.6413 - 9.5622| = 1.9209. This is a relatively small lateral distance, indicating potential lateral risk.

2. **Longitudinal Distance:** The longitudinal distance is |-90.1602 - (-67.8587)| = 22.3015. This distance suggests they are separated longitudinally.

3. **Velocity Difference:** The obstacle is moving faster than the ego vehicle.  The longitudinal velocity difference contributes to a decreasing longitudinal distance between them.  This is a key factor to consider for collision risk.

4. **Trajectory Prediction:** Observing the positions from t=0.1s to t=0.9s, both ego and obstacle appear to be moving in roughly the same direction (along the lanelet), with the obstacle ahead of the ego. The obstacle's consistently higher velocity, coupled with the relatively small lateral distance and decreasing longitudinal distance, suggests an increasing risk of collision over time. Though not imminent in the next instant, the trajectories suggest that if these trends persist, a collision is increasingly likely in the near future unless the ego decelerates or the obstacle accelerates significantly.


5. **TTC and MDC:**  Due to the nature of the provided data, precise TTC calculation is challenging without assumptions about future behavior (constant velocity, constant acceleration, etc.).  However, we can estimate it qualitatively. Given the closing longitudinal speed and current distance, the TTC appears to be on the order of several seconds (probably more than 5s). However, the lateral distance is already quite small, so a lateral shift by either vehicle could quickly lead to collision. The MDC is the Euclidean distance between the two vehicle positions at t=0.9s, which calculates to roughly sqrt(1.9209^2 + 22.3015^2) ~= 22.38.

6. **Risk Assessment:**  Based on the analysis, while not an immediate collision (t=0.9s), the trends in the data (decreasing longitudinal distance, small lateral distance, higher obstacle velocity) suggest a developing dangerous situation. We classify the obstacle as a High Risk (Score 2) due to the potential for future collision if the trajectories remain unchanged.
