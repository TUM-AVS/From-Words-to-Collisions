### Analysis:

1. **Ego Vehicle (20037.0) and Obstacle (20036.0) Trajectories**:
   - Both vehicles are in the same lanelet (1063.0) throughout the observed timesteps.
   - The ego vehicle is decelerating (negative acceleration) from 12.922 m/s to 8.8674 m/s over 0.9 seconds.
   - The obstacle is also decelerating but at a slower rate (acceleration: -0.5 m/s²) from 13.0206 m/s to 12.6206 m/s over the same period.

2. **Relative Motion**:
   - The obstacle is ahead of the ego vehicle. At 0.9 seconds:
     - Ego position: (7.6413, -90.1602)
     - Obstacle position: (9.5622, -67.8587)
     - The lateral distance is significant (22.3015m in the Y-axis), but the longitudinal distance is relatively small (1.9209m in the X-axis).
   - The relative longitudinal velocity (obstacle speed - ego speed) is 12.6206 - 8.8674 = 3.7532 m/s (obstacle is moving away from the ego).

3. **Time to Collision (TTC)**:
   - TTC = Longitudinal distance / Relative longitudinal velocity = 1.9209 / 3.7532 ≈ 0.51s.
   - This indicates a very short time to collision, but the obstacle is moving away from the ego vehicle, reducing the immediate risk.

4. **Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC)**:
   - The lateral distance is large (22.3015m), so the risk of collision is low despite the small longitudinal distance.

5. **Risk Assessment**:
   - The obstacle is moving away from the ego vehicle, and the lateral distance is significant. The risk of collision is low.
   - Overall Risk Score: **4 (Low Risk)** - Minimal risk, sufficient time to react.
