### Analysis and Evaluation

**At 0.9 seconds:**

**Relative Position and Velocity:**

- **Ego Vehicle (20037.0):**
  - Position: (7.6413, -90.1602)
  - Orientation: 1.3025504666982133 rad
  - Velocity: 8.8674 m/s
  - Located in lanelet: 1063.0

- **Obstacle Vehicle (20036.0):**
  - Position: (9.5622, -67.8587)
  - Orientation: 1.5949 rad
  - Velocity: 12.6206 m/s
  - Located in lanelet: 1063.0

**Position and Motion Analysis:**

1. **Distance Calculation:**
   - Longitudinal distance difference: \(9.5622 - 7.6413 = 1.9209\) meters
   - Lateral distance difference: \(-67.8587 + 90.1602 = 22.3015\) meters
   - Thus, the obstacle is ahead and significantly laterally displaced.

2. **Velocity Analysis:**
   - Relative longitudinal velocity (ahead): \(12.6206 - 8.8674 = 3.7532\) m/s

3. **TTC (Time To Collision):**
   - Since the obstacle is ahead and moving faster, use lateral analysis:
   - Significant lateral distance and higher obstacle speed suggest no collision path.

4. **MDC (Minimum Distance to Collision):**
   - Since lateral distance is large, collision is very unlikely as the paths do not intersect.

Based on the positions, orientation, and velocities, the obstacle is ahead but significantly off path laterally. Therefore, there is **no immediate risk of collision** considering the large lateral separation and faster relative velocity.

**Overall Risk Score:**  
For the current context, despite both vehicles being in the same lanelet, the separation and velocities imply **Negligible Risk (5)** due to substantially lateral distance and divergent paths.
