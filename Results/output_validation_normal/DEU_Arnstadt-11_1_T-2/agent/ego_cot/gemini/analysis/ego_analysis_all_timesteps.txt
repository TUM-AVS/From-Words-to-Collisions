### Safety analysis for timestep 0.9s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 20036
- Distance Risk reason: At 0.9 seconds, Obstacle 20036 is 17.51m longitudinally and 17.51m laterally away from the ego vehicle, located in the front-left.  These distances are substantial and represent no immediate risk. The obstacle is moving away from the ego vehicle both longitudinally and laterally.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Since the obstacle is moving away from the ego vehicle, the TTC values are not meaningful in a collision avoidance context. The increasing distances over subsequent timesteps confirm the lack of collision risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5
