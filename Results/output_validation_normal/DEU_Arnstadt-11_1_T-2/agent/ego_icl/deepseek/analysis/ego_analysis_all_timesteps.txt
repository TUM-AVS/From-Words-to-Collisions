### Obstacle-by-Obstacle Analysis

#### Obstacle 20036 (Front-left of ego car)
- **Most Recent Timestep (0.9s):**
  - **Adjusted Distances:** Longitudinal 17.51 m, Lateral 2.45 m
  - **Relative Velocities:** Longitudinal 3.22 m/s (moving away), Lateral 3.64 m/s (moving away to the left)
  - **Motion Description:** Obstacle is moving away longitudinally and laterally to the left.

- **Trajectory Analysis:**
  - Over the timesteps (0.1s to 0.9s), the obstacle consistently moves away from the ego vehicle in both longitudinal and lateral directions. The distances increase over time, and the relative velocities are positive (moving away) in both dimensions.

- **Time-to-Collision (TTC):**
  - **Longitudinal TTC:** Not applicable (moving away, relative velocity is positive).
  - **Lateral TTC:** Not applicable (moving away, relative velocity is positive).
  - Since both TTCs are not applicable (paths are diverging), there is no imminent collision risk from TTC.

- **Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC):**
  - The obstacle is moving away in both dimensions, so the MDC is the current distance at the most recent timestep.
  - **Longitudinal MDC:** 17.51 m (No Risk, MDC > 5.0 m).
  - **Lateral MDC:** 2.45 m (Low Risk, 3.0 < MDC â‰¤ 5.0 m).
  - The smaller of the two distances is lateral (2.45 m), which falls into the Low Risk category.

- **Overall Risk Assessment:**
  - The obstacle is moving away in both dimensions, and the distances are increasing. The smallest MDC is 2.45 m (Low Risk), and TTC is not applicable (No Risk). 
  - **Overall Risk Score:** 4 (Low Risk).

### Explanation:
- There is no collision or extreme/high risk obstacle in this scenario. The only obstacle (20036) is moving away from the ego vehicle in both longitudinal and lateral directions, with sufficient distance to avoid any significant risk. The overall risk is Low (Score 4).
