Obstacle 20036 is in the Front-left of the ego vehicle.

Trajectory Analysis:
Over the past 0.9 seconds, Obstacle 20036 has been consistently moving away from the ego vehicle both longitudinally and laterally. The longitudinal distance has increased from 16.34m to 17.51m, and the lateral distance has increased from 0.43m to 2.45m.  This indicates a diverging trajectory.

TTC Calculation:
Since the obstacle is moving away in both directions, a classical TTC calculation (distance/relative_velocity) is not applicable as it would result in a negative or undefined value. The increasing distances confirm there is no immediate collision risk.

MDC Calculation:
Given the diverging trajectory, the MDC is increasing and not relevant for collision assessment.  At the last timestep, the minimum distance is the current lateral distance of 2.45m.

Risk Assessment:
Based on the increasing longitudinal and lateral distances, and the diverging trajectory, the risk of collision with Obstacle 20036 is negligible.

Overall Risk Score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
