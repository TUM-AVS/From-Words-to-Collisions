## Obstacle Analysis: Obstacle 20036

### Trajectory Analysis:
- **Initial Position (0.0 seconds):** The obstacle starts at a longitudinal distance of around 16.34m and a lateral distance of 0.43m. Over time, the obstacle is observed to be moving away from the ego vehicle both longitudinally and laterally.
- **Motion Description Trend:** The obstacle consistently moves away longitudinally and laterally to the left, indicating that there is no closing trajectory towards the ego vehicle.

### Most Recent Timestep (0.9 seconds):
- **Adjusted Longitudinal Distance:** 17.51m
- **Adjusted Lateral Distance:** 2.45m
- **Relative Velocity (Longitudinal):** 3.22 m/s (moving away)
- **Relative Velocity (Lateral):** 3.64 m/s (moving away)

### Calculations:
- **TTC (Longitudinal):** Not applicable for collision, as the relative velocity is positive, indicating the obstacle is moving away.
- **TTC (Lateral):** Not applicable for collision, as the relative velocity is positive, indicating the obstacle is moving away.
- **MDC:** As both the longitudinal and lateral distances are increasing, MDC is not a concern here but would be the smallest of the two distances, which also is increasing, further confirming no collision risk.

### Risk Assessment:
- **Trajectory Confirmation:** The motion descriptions and velocity indicate the obstacle is moving away from the ego vehicle in both the longitudinal and lateral directions.
- **Risk Score**: Based on a TTC greater than 5.0 seconds (since velocities are diverging) and MDC greater than 5.0 meters (since distances are increasing), the risk level is assessed as 5, meaning no significant risk is detected.

Based on the above analysis, there is no notable collision or risk of an imminent collision with Obstacle 20036.
