At t=0.9s, the ego vehicle is at (7.6413, -90.1602) and the obstacle is at (9.5622, -67.8587).  While both are in the same lanelet, the obstacle is significantly further down the lane (-67.8587 vs -90.1602).  Examining the trajectories, both ego and obstacle are moving forward, but the obstacle's y-coordinate is decreasing faster than the ego's, suggesting the gap is widening.  Although the x-coordinates are relatively close, given the separation in the y-direction and the velocity/acceleration profiles, a collision is unlikely in the immediate future.
