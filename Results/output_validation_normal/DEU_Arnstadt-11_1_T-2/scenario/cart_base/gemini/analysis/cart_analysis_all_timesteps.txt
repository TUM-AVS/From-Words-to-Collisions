At t=0.9s, the ego vehicle is at (7.6413, -90.1602) and the obstacle is at (9.5622, -67.8587).  While both are in the same lanelet, the obstacle is significantly further down the lane (-67.8587 vs -90.1602).  Examining the trajectories, both ego and obstacle are moving forward, but the obstacle is consistently much further ahead.  The distance between them is not decreasing rapidly enough to suggest an immediate collision risk. Based on the given data, a collision within the next second is unlikely.
