### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep:

### Obstacle Analysis:
- **Obstacle ID**: 20036.0  
  - **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is moving in the same lanelet (1063.0) as the ego vehicle. Over the past timesteps, the distance between the ego and the obstacle has been decreasing (from ~21.7m at 0.1s to ~22.3m at 0.9s). However, the obstacle is still far ahead (~22.3m at 0.9s).  
  - **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)  
  - **Time Risk reason**: The ego is decelerating more aggressively (-1.6546 m/s² at 0.9s) compared to the obstacle (-0.5 m/s²). The relative velocity is ~3.75 m/s (ego: 8.8674 m/s, obstacle: 12.6206 m/s). TTC = distance / relative velocity ≈ 22.3 / 3.75 ≈ 5.95s, which is sufficient for reaction.  
  - **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)  
  - **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low Risk)  

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. **Same Lanelet**: Both ego and obstacle are in lanelet 1063.0, indicating shared trajectory.  
2. **Distance Trend**: The obstacle is ahead (~22.3m at 0.9s) and moving away (distance increased slightly from 0.8s to 0.9s).  
3. **Velocity/Acceleration**: Ego is decelerating faster than the obstacle, reducing relative velocity over time.  
4. **TTC**: ~5.95s is safe for reaction.  
5. **Conclusion**: No immediate collision risk.
