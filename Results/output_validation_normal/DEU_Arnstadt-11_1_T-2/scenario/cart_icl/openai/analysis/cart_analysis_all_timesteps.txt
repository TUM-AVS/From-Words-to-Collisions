### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 20022**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is at a substantial distance, never nearing the ego vehicle's path. Its changes in position and inactivity suggest it's not moving toward the ego.
  - **Distance safety score**: 5
  - **Time Risk reason**: The obstacle's negligible velocity and constant deceleration indicate it's not a time threat.
  - **Time safety score**: 5
  - **Overall Risk score**: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 20023**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Located in a different lanelet and moving away slightly from the ego. Continual increase in the distance over time.
  - **Distance safety score**: 5
  - **Time Risk reason**: Steady velocity increase, but trajectory diverges from ego. Acceleration doesnâ€™t suggest future collision.
  - **Time safety score**: 5
  - **Overall Risk score**: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 20024**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Remains stationary relative to the ego lanelet; no approachages.
  - **Distance safety score**: 5
  - **Time Risk reason**: Minimal velocity and stationary nature over time reduce any potential risk.
  - **Time safety score**: 5
  - **Overall Risk score**: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 20030**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is far ahead, not conflicting with the ego trajectory. Consistently distant over time.
  - **Distance safety score**: 5
  - **Time Risk reason**: Although moving quickly, it's consistent, with no signs of intercepting the ego path.
  - **Time safety score**: 5
  - **Overall Risk score**: 5

- **Obstacle ID: 20034**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Closer in lanelet, but diverging path and constant distance maintenance imply no imminent conflict.
  - **Distance safety score**: 4
  - **Time Risk reason**: High and stable velocity with minimal acceleration ensures a predictable trajectory avoiding the ego.
  - **Time safety score**: 4
  - **Overall Risk score**: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 20035**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: In close proximity initially, but gradually distancing from ego due to diverging paths.
  - **Distance safety score**: 3
  - **Time Risk reason**: Higher deceleration suggests it's pulling away quickly, reducing time risk.
  - **Time safety score**: 3
  - **Overall Risk score**: 3

- **Obstacle ID: 20036**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Rapid velocity but in parallel direction to ego, with consistency reducing danger.
  - **Distance safety score**: 4
  - **Time Risk reason**: Despite speed, the obstacle's consistent and declining velocity ensures it won't intercept the ego.
  - **Time safety score**: 4
  - **Overall Risk score**: 4

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
The historical and current data indicate no obstacles move significantly toward or merge with the ego path. Even with high speeds, they either maintain their course or diverge notably from the ego. The traffic dynamics suggest no immediate collision scenarios and ensure controlled risk levels.
