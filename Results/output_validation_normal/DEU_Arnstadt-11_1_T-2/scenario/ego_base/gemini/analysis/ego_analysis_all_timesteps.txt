Obstacle 20036 is moving away from the ego vehicle both longitudinally and laterally to the left. At the most recent timestep (0.9 seconds), the longitudinal distance is increasing at a rate of 3.22 m/s and the lateral distance is increasing at a rate of 3.64 m/s.  Although the relative lateral acceleration is small (1.10 m/sÂ²), the obstacle is moving away and poses no immediate threat.  The increasing distances and velocities suggest the risk is decreasing.
