### Safety analysis for timestep 0.9 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 20036
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 20036 is located 17.51m longitudinally and 17.51m laterally in the front-left of the ego vehicle.  These distances are significant and suggest no immediate risk.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: The obstacle is moving away from the ego vehicle both longitudinally and laterally. This indicates a decreasing risk of collision over time.  While specific TTC values aren't calculable without precise velocity and acceleration data, the motion clearly indicates divergence.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5
