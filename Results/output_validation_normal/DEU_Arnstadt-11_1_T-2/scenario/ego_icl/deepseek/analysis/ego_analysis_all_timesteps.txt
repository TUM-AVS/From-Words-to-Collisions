### Obstacle-by-Obstacle Analysis

**Obstacle 20036 (Front-left of ego car)**
- **Most Recent Timestep (0.9s):**
  - **Adjusted Distances:** 
    - Longitudinal: 17.51 m (increasing)
    - Lateral: 2.45 m (increasing)
  - **Relative Velocities:**
    - Longitudinal: 3.22 m/s (moving away)
    - Lateral: 3.64 m/s (moving away to the left)
  - **Motion Description:** 
    - Obstacle is moving away longitudinally.
    - Obstacle is moving away laterally to the left.

**Trajectory Analysis:**
- The obstacle is consistently moving away from the ego vehicle in both longitudinal and lateral directions across all timesteps.
- Longitudinal distance increases from 16.34 m to 17.51 m.
- Lateral distance increases from 0.43 m to 2.45 m.
- Relative velocities in both directions are positive (moving away), and acceleration trends show the obstacle is accelerating away.

**TTC Calculation:**
- **Longitudinal TTC:** Not applicable (relative velocity is positive, moving away).
- **Lateral TTC:** Not applicable (relative velocity is positive, moving away).

**MDC Calculation:**
- The obstacle is moving away in both directions, so the MDC is the current distance (minimum of longitudinal and lateral).
- **MDC:** 2.45 m (lateral distance, the smaller of the two).

**Risk Assessment:**
- **MDC Risk:** 2.45 m falls into "Medium Risk" (1.0 < MDC â‰¤ 3.0 meters).
- **TTC Risk:** Not applicable (moving away).
- **Overall Risk:** Medium Risk (3).

### Conclusion
- The obstacle is moving away from the ego vehicle in both directions, with no convergence in trajectories.
- There is no collision or extreme risk scenario.
