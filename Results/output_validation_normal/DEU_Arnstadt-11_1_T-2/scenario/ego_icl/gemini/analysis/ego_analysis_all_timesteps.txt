Obstacle 20036 Analysis:

Trajectory Analysis:  Over the past 0.9 seconds, Obstacle 20036 has consistently moved away from the ego vehicle both longitudinally and laterally.  The longitudinal distance has increased from 16.34m to 17.51m, and the lateral distance has increased from 0.43m to 2.45m. This clearly indicates a diverging trajectory.

TTC Calculation: Since the obstacle is moving away in both directions, TTC calculation is not applicable for collision assessment.  The relative velocities are positive, meaning the *ego* vehicle is closing the distance, but the obstacle's movement is the dominant factor, leading to increasing separation.

MDC Calculation: At the last timestep (0.9s), the longitudinal distance is 17.51m and the lateral distance is 2.45m. Since the obstacle is positioned front-left, the smaller of the two distances (lateral - 2.45m) would typically be considered for MDC. However, given the diverging trajectory, the MDC is effectively increasing.

Risk Assessment:
* Longitudinal Risk: No Risk (5) - Obstacle is moving away longitudinally.
* Lateral Risk: No Risk (5) - Obstacle is moving away laterally.
* Overall Risk: No Risk (5)

This is NOT a collision scenario.
