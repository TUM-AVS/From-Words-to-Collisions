### Obstacle-by-Obstacle Analysis

#### Obstacle 20036 Analysis:

- **Position and Motion Analysis:**
  - In the most recent timestep (0.9 seconds), obstacle 20036 is positioned at an adjusted longitudinal distance of 17.51 meters and a lateral distance of 2.45 meters, both indicating the obstacle is to the front-left and moving away from the ego vehicle.
  - Across the timesteps, the obstacle has consistently shown increased distances both longitudinally and laterally, confirming that it is indeed moving away.

- **Trajectory Analysis:**
  - **Longitudinal trajectory:** The longitudinal distance is increasing fairly consistently, starting at 16.34 meters at 0.1 seconds and ending at 17.51 meters at 0.9 seconds. Additionally, the longitudinal relative velocity is positive (increasing over time), indicating the obstacle is moving away.
  - **Lateral trajectory:** The lateral distance has increased across the timesteps—from 0.43 meters to 2.45 meters—while the lateral relative velocity is also positive, which reassures us that the obstacle is moving away laterally as well.

- **TTC and MDC Calculations:**
  - **TTC Longitudinal:** As the obstacle is moving away, the TTC is technically longer than measurable (> 5 seconds), as relative velocity suggests increasing distance.
  - **TTC Lateral:** Similarly, with the obstacle moving laterally away, the TTC is non-critical (> 5 seconds).
  - **MDC:** With continuously increasing distances along both axes, MDC is also greater than 5.0 meters. 

- **Risk Assessment:**
  - The distances will continue to grow given current trends in velocity and acceleration, leading to no converging paths or potential proximity threats.
  - **Overall Risk Score:** 5 (No Risk)

### Conclusion
Based on the analysis, obstacle 20036 poses no collision risk due to its trajectory of moving away from the ego vehicle in both dimensions. There are no grounds for a collision or extreme risk assessment in this scenario.
