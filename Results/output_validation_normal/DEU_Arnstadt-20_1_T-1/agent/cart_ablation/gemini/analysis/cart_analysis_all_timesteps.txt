The ego vehicle and obstacle 20017.0 are both in the same lanelet (915.0).  The obstacle is significantly behind the ego vehicle initially.  Looking at the y-coordinates, the obstacle is closing the distance to the ego vehicle, but not drastically over the provided timeframe.  While the data doesn't indicate an immediate collision, further projection of their trajectories is needed to definitively rule out a potential future collision, especially given they are in the same lane and the obstacle's speed is similar to the ego vehicle's.  However, based on the provided 1-second snapshot, the risk is not currently extreme or indicating a collision.
