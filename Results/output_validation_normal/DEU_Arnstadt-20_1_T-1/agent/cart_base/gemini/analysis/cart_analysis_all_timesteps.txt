The ego vehicle and obstacle 20017.0 are in the same lanelet (915.0).  The obstacle is consistently behind the ego vehicle, but the distance between them is decreasing over the provided time steps.  While a collision hasn't occurred within the first second, the continuous approach suggests a potential future collision if the obstacle's speed continues to be close to ego vehicle's and their relative positions along lanelet's trajectory do not change. Therefore, I classify this obstacle as a high risk.
