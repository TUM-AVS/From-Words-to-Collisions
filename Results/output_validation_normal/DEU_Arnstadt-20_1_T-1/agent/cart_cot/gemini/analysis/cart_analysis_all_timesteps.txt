At t=0.9s, the ego vehicle is at (-15.9238, -74.5688) with a velocity of 13.4573 and the obstacle (ID 20017.0) is at (-23.1257, -102.1253) with a velocity of 13.1675.  Both are in the same lanelet (915.0).

**Analysis and Calculations:**

1. **Longitudinal TTC:** The obstacle is behind the ego vehicle in the Y-direction (more negative Y).  The difference in Y positions is |-102.1253 - (-74.5688)| = 27.5565. The difference in longitudinal velocities (assuming the orientations are similar and primarily along the Y-axis) is |13.4573 - 13.1675| = 0.2898.  A rough longitudinal TTC is 27.5565 / 0.2898 ≈ 95 seconds.  This is a very large value, indicating no immediate longitudinal collision risk.

2. **Lateral TTC:** The difference in X positions is |-23.1257 - (-15.9238)| = 7.2019.  We don't have explicit lateral velocities, but given the orientations remain fairly constant throughout the provided timeframe, we can assume the lateral movement is minimal. Given the significant longitudinal distance and relatively constant lateral positions, lateral collision risk is low.

3. **Minimum Distance Calculation (MDC):** The distance between ego and obstacle at t=0.9s is sqrt(((-23.1257 - -15.9238)^2) + ((-102.1253 - -74.5688)^2)) ≈ 28.38 meters.

4. **Trajectory Prediction:**  The obstacle is consistently behind the ego and moving slightly slower.  Based on the constant acceleration and velocity profiles, it is highly unlikely the obstacle will collide with the ego in the near future.


**Risk Assessment:**

Based on the MDC, TTC, and trajectory analysis, the risk of collision with obstacle 20017.0 is negligible.  The obstacle's motion suggests it will remain behind the ego vehicle.
