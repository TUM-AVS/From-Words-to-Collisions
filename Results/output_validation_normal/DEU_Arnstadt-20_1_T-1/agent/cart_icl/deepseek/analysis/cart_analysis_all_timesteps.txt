### Analysis:

1. **Relative Motion and Trajectory**:
   - The ego vehicle (ID: 20016) and the obstacle (ID: 20017) are both moving in the same lanelet (915.0).
   - The ego vehicle is ahead of the obstacle, with the obstacle trailing behind.
   - The ego vehicle's velocity is slightly higher than the obstacle's velocity (13.4573 m/s vs. 13.1675 m/s at 0.9s), indicating the ego is pulling away from the obstacle.

2. **Time to Collision (TTC)**:
   - At 0.9s, the longitudinal distance between the ego and the obstacle is approximately 27.5565 m (calculated as the Euclidean distance between (-15.9238, -74.5688) and (-23.1257, -102.1253)).
   - The relative velocity is 0.2898 m/s (ego velocity - obstacle velocity).
   - TTC = Distance / Relative Velocity = 27.5565 / 0.2898 â‰ˆ 95.09 seconds. This is a very large TTC, indicating no immediate risk of collision.

3. **Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC)**:
   - Given the large TTC and the fact that the ego is moving away from the obstacle, the MDC is effectively increasing over time.

4. **Risk Assessment**:
   - The obstacle is not on a collision course with the ego vehicle.
   - The relative motion suggests the ego is safely distancing itself from the obstacle.
   - The risk of collision is negligible.
