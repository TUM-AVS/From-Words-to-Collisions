At t=0.9s, the ego vehicle at (-15.92, -74.57) is moving with a velocity of 13.46 m/s and an orientation of -1.65 radians. The obstacle (ID 20017) is at (-23.13, -102.13) with a velocity of 13.17 m/s and an orientation of -1.99 radians. Both are in the same lanelet (915).

The obstacle is behind and to the left of the ego vehicle.  Let's approximate TTC and MDC.

* **Longitudinal Distance:** -23.13 - (-15.92) = -7.21m (obstacle is behind)
* **Lateral Distance:** -102.13 - (-74.57) = -27.56m (obstacle is to the left)
* **Relative Longitudinal Velocity:** 13.17 - 13.46 = -0.29 m/s (ego is slightly faster)
* **Approximate TTC (longitudinal):** -7.21 / -0.29 â‰ˆ 24.86s  (This is a very rough estimate as it doesn't account for lateral movement or acceleration, but suggests no immediate longitudinal collision risk.)


Given the lateral distance, similar orientations, and the fact that the ego vehicle is slightly faster while both are moving in roughly the same direction, the risk of collision is low. The data suggests an overtaking maneuver, and the large lateral distance indicates sufficient separation.
