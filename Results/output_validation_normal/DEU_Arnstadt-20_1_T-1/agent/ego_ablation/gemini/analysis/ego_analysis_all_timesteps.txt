At the most recent timestep (0.9 seconds), Obstacle 20017 is located 23.52 meters longitudinally and -3.46 meters laterally relative to the ego vehicle.  It's moving towards the ego vehicle longitudinally at -1.09 m/s and further away laterally at -4.51 m/s. While the longitudinal motion indicates closing behavior, the lateral motion shows divergence, making a collision unlikely.

Given the current distance, relative velocity, and the fact that the obstacle is moving away laterally, the risk of collision is low.
