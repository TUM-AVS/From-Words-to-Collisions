At t=0.9s, Obstacle 20017 is located 23.52m in front and 3.46m to the right of the ego vehicle. It is moving towards the ego vehicle longitudinally at -1.09 m/s and moving away laterally to the right at -4.51 m/s.  While the longitudinal motion suggests closing the distance, the lateral velocity indicates it is moving away from the ego vehicle's path. The lateral movement and relatively slow longitudinal closing speed suggest a low risk of collision in the immediate future. This could change if either the lateral velocity decreases significantly or the longitudinal velocity increases significantly towards the ego vehicle.  Therefore, a risk score of 4 (Low Risk) seems appropriate.
