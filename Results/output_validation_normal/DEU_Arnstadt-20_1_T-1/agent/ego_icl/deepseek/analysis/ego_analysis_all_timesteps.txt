### Obstacle-by-Obstacle Analysis

#### Obstacle 20017 (Front-right of ego car)
- **Most Recent Timestep (0.9s):**
  - Adjusted longitudinal distance: 23.52 m
  - Adjusted lateral distance: -3.46 m
  - Relative velocity: longitudinal -1.09 m/s (approaching), lateral -4.51 m/s (moving away)
  - Motion: Obstacle is driving toward the ego car longitudinally. Obstacle is moving away laterally to the right.

- **Trajectory Analysis:**
  - **Longitudinal:** The obstacle is consistently approaching the ego car with a relatively stable closing velocity (~1.09 m/s). The longitudinal distance decreases slightly from 23.86 m to 23.52 m over 0.9s.
  - **Lateral:** The obstacle is moving away from the ego car to the right with increasing lateral distance (from -0.93 m to -3.46 m over 0.9s). The lateral relative velocity is high (~4.51 m/s away).

- **Time-to-Collision (TTC):**
  - **Longitudinal TTC:** 23.52 m / 1.09 m/s ≈ 21.58 s (No Risk, TTC > 5.0s)
  - **Lateral TTC:** Not applicable (moving away, no collision risk laterally).

- **Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC):**
  - The obstacle is moving away laterally, so the MDC is effectively the current lateral distance (3.46 m). Since the obstacle is not closing laterally, the MDC is not decreasing.
  - Longitudinally, the MDC is large (23.52 m) and not closing rapidly.

- **Risk Assessment:**
  - Longitudinal: Low Risk (TTC ≈ 21.58s, MDC ≈ 23.52 m)
  - Lateral: No Risk (moving away)
  - **Overall Risk:** Low Risk (4) – No imminent collision threat.

### Reasoning:
- Obstacle 20017 is moving away laterally and only slowly approaching longitudinally. The large distances (both longitudinal and lateral) and the fact that the lateral distance is increasing mean there is no significant collision risk. The overall risk is Low (4). No collision, extreme risk, or high risk obstacles are present.
