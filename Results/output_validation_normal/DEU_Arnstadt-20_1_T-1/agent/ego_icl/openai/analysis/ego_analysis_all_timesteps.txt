**Analysis of Obstacle 20017:**

**1. Trajectory Analysis Across Timesteps:**
- This obstacle moves towards the ego vehicle with decreasing longitudinal distance at each step.
- It is also moving away laterally from the ego vehicle to the right, indicating a divergence in lateral trajectory.

**2. Latest Timestep (0.9 seconds):**
- **Adjusted Distances**: Given as needed for calculation, but not provided directly in this case.
- **Relative Velocities**: Longitudinal velocity toward the ego vehicle is -1.09 m/s; lateral velocity away is -4.51 m/s.

**3. Time-to-Collision (TTC) Calculation:**
- **Longitudinal TTC**: 
  - Distance reducing: 23.52 m at 1.09 m/s.
  - TTC (longitudinal) = 23.52 / 1.09 â‰ˆ 21.58 seconds (safely > 5 seconds).
  
- **Lateral TTC**:
  - With the obstacle moving away at -4.51 m/s, lateral TTC is not applicable as this indicates increasing lateral separation.

**4. Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC):**
- As the longitudinal distance is substantial and steadily decreasing, and the lateral position indicates continual divergence, the overall MDC remains safely above critical limits.

**5. Motion Description Verification:**
- Consistent observations that the obstacle moves toward longitudinally while diverging laterally.
- Aligning with the given relative velocities and acceleration trends.

**6. Risk Assessment Based on Criteria:**
- **TTC > 5 seconds** in the longitudinal direction and diverging laterally suggest a negligible risk in terms of collision potential.
- Risk due to longitudinal motion is reduced due to the sufficient distance (23.52 m) and slow closing velocity.
- The lateral movement away from the ego ensures no side collision risk, consolidating a very low collision risk assessment.

**Overall Conclusion for Obstacle 20017:**
- Comprehensive analysis suggests a risk level of 5 (Negligible Risk).
