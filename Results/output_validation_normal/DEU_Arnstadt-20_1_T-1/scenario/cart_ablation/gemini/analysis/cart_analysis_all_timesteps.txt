At t=0.9s, Ego is at (-15.9238, -74.5688) and obstacle 20017.0 is at (-23.1257, -102.1253). Both are in the same lanelet (915.0). While the obstacle is behind the ego, both are moving in roughly the same direction (indicated by similar, negative orientations). The distance between them is considerable, and the provided trajectory information doesn't suggest an immediate or imminent collision.  Therefore, no immediate or extreme collision risk is detected.
