At t=0.9s, Ego is at (-15.9238, -74.5688) and obstacle 20017.0 is at (-23.1257, -102.1253). Both are in the same lanelet (915.0). While the obstacle is further down the lanelet than the ego vehicle, the provided data doesn't give us information about lanelet width or shape.  It's possible the lanelet is curving or that the obstacle is partially obstructing the ego vehicle's path.  We also don't have information about the sizes of the vehicles.  However, based on the positions and the consistent trajectory so far, there is no immediate risk of collision.  More data like lane geometry and vehicle sizes are needed for a more precise assessment.
