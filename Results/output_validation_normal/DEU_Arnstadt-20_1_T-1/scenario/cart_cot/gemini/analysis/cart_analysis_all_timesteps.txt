### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 20017.0
- Distance Risk reason: Both Ego and Obstacle 20017.0 are in the same lanelet (915.0). At the last timestep (0.9 seconds), the obstacle is approximately 57.5 meters ahead of the Ego vehicle.  While the distance is significant at this moment, analysis of the previous timesteps shows that the obstacle is moving slower than the ego vehicle. This means the distance between them is decreasing over time.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: The ego vehicle is traveling faster than the obstacle, evidenced by the decreasing distance between them over the provided timesteps. While a collision is not imminent at this exact moment, the trend suggests that if this speed difference continues, the risk of collision will increase in the future. The consistent acceleration of both vehicles supports this projection.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. **Most critical obstacle:** Obstacle 20017.0 is the most critical as it's in the same lanelet and ahead of the ego vehicle.
2. **Trajectory analysis:** Over the 10 timesteps, both the ego vehicle and the obstacle are moving in roughly the same direction (indicated by their similar orientations). However, the ego vehicle is catching up to the obstacle.
3. **Relative position, velocity, and acceleration:** The relative position shows a decreasing trend. The ego vehicle's velocity is higher than the obstacle's, and both vehicles are accelerating, although the ego's acceleration fluctuates more.
4. **Collision determination:**  At the current time (0.9s), a collision has not occurred. However, if the current trend continues, a collision is possible in the future.
5. **Reasoning:** The consistent closing distance, coupled with the ego vehicle's higher velocity, indicates a potential collision if no corrective action is taken by the ego vehicle (e.g., braking or lane change).

{
  "CollisionObstacles": [],
  "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null,
  "ScenarioAnalysis": {
    "IsCollisionScenario": false,
    "Reasoning": "While a collision hasn't occurred yet, the ego vehicle is approaching obstacle 20017.0 at a higher speed.  If this trend continues without corrective action, a collision is possible in the near future. Therefore, the current situation warrants attention although it's not an immediate collision scenario within the observed timeframe."
