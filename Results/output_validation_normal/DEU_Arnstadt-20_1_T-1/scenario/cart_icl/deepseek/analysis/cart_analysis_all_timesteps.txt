### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep:

### Obstacle Analysis:
- **Obstacle ID**: 20017.0  
  - **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is in the same lanelet (915.0) as the ego vehicle but is consistently moving away in the Y-direction (longitudinal distance increasing from -92.1227 to -102.1253 over 0.9 seconds). The lateral distance (X-direction) is also increasing (from -19.1851 to -23.1257).  
  - **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)  
  - **Time Risk reason**: The relative velocity (ego velocity - obstacle velocity) is positive (13.4573 - 13.1675 = 0.2898 m/s), indicating the ego is moving faster but the obstacle is accelerating slightly (0.6118 m/s² vs. ego's 0.0871 m/s²). The longitudinal distance is large (~27.5 m) and increasing.  
  - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)  
  - **Overall Risk score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)  

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. **Lanelet Check**: Both ego and obstacle are in lanelet 915.0, but their trajectories are diverging.  
2. **Distance Trend**: The Y-distance (longitudinal) increases from ~29.5 m to ~27.5 m over 0.9 seconds, and the X-distance (lateral) increases from ~3.9 m to ~7.2 m.  
3. **Velocity/Acceleration**: The ego is slightly faster but not closing the gap significantly due to the obstacle's higher acceleration.  
4. **Conclusion**: No collision risk; the obstacle is moving away.
