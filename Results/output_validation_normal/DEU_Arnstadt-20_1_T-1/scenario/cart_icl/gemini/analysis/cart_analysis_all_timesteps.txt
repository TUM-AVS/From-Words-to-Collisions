### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
This is not a collision scenario. All obstacles maintain a safe distance from the ego vehicle, either laterally (in different lanelets) or longitudinally. Although some obstacles are in the same lanelet, their trajectories and velocities do not indicate an immediate risk of collision within the predicted timeframe.
