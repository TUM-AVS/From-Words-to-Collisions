Obstacle 20017 is moving away laterally to the right and although it is driving toward the ego car longitudinally, it is still at a safe distance (23.52m).  The relative lateral velocity indicates a diverging trajectory. Given the current distance, relative velocity, and lateral movement, a collision is unlikely.
