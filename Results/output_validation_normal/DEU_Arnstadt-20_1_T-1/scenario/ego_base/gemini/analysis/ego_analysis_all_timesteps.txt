At t=0.9s, obstacle 20017 is located 23.52m in front and 3.46m to the right of the ego vehicle.  It is moving towards the ego vehicle longitudinally at -1.09 m/s and moving away laterally to the right at -4.51 m/s. Although the obstacle is getting closer longitudinally, it is also moving away laterally. Given the current velocities and distances, a collision does not appear imminent in the next timestep.  However, continuous monitoring is necessary.
