### Safety analysis for timestep 0.9s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:
- **Obstacle ID:** 20017
- **Distance Risk reason:** At t=0.9s, Obstacle 20017 is located 23.52m longitudinally and 23.52m laterally in the front-right of the ego vehicle.  While the longitudinal distance is decreasing, the lateral distance shows the obstacle is moving away to the right, significantly reducing the risk of collision.  The distances themselves are substantial.
- **Distance safety score:** 5
- **Time Risk reason:** While the longitudinal relative velocity is negative (approaching), the lateral velocity indicates a strong movement away from the ego vehicle.  Given the current distances and lateral movement, a collision is highly unlikely. TTC calculations are not essential here as the lateral movement dominates the risk assessment.
- **Time safety score:** 5
- **Overall Risk score:** 5


### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
    "CollisionObstacle": null,
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null,
    "IsCollisionScenario": false,
    "Justification": "No obstacle presents an immediate collision risk. Obstacle 20017, while approaching longitudinally, is moving away laterally and poses no danger."
}
