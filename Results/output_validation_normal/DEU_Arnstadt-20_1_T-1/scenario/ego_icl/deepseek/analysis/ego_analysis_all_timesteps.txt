### Obstacle-by-Obstacle Analysis

#### Obstacle 20017 (Most Recent Timestep: 0.9s)
- **Position**: Front-right of ego car
- **Adjusted Distances**: 
  - Longitudinal: 23.52 m (front)
  - Lateral: -3.46 m (right)
- **Relative Velocity**: 
  - Longitudinal: -1.09 m/s (approaching ego)
  - Lateral: -4.51 m/s (moving away from ego to the right)
- **Motion Description**: 
  - Obstacle is driving toward the ego car longitudinally.
  - Obstacle is moving away laterally to the right.

#### Trajectory Analysis (Across Timesteps)
- **Longitudinal Distance**: Decreasing slowly from 23.86 m to 23.52 m over 0.9s.
- **Lateral Distance**: Increasing (moving away) from -0.93 m to -3.46 m over 0.9s.
- **Longitudinal Relative Velocity**: Approximately -1.0 to -1.3 m/s (consistent approach).
- **Lateral Relative Velocity**: Approximately -3.1 to -4.7 m/s (consistent movement away).

#### TTC Calculation
- **Longitudinal TTC**: 
  - Distance = 23.52 m
  - Relative Velocity = 1.09 m/s (absolute value since approaching)
  - TTC = 23.52 / 1.09 ≈ 21.58 seconds (No Risk, TTC > 5.0s)
- **Lateral TTC**: 
  - Distance = 3.46 m (absolute value)
  - Relative Velocity = 4.51 m/s (moving away)
  - TTC is not applicable (diverging paths, no collision risk).

#### MDC Calculation
- **Longitudinal MDC**: 23.52 m (No Risk, MDC > 5.0m)
- **Lateral MDC**: 3.46 m (Low Risk, 3.0 < MDC ≤ 5.0m)
- **Overall MDC**: The obstacle is moving away laterally, so the primary risk is longitudinal. Since the longitudinal distance is large and increasing, the MDC is effectively the longitudinal distance.

#### Risk Assessment
- **Longitudinal Risk**: No Risk (TTC > 5.0s, MDC > 5.0m)
- **Lateral Risk**: Low Risk (MDC = 3.46m, but moving away)
- **Overall Risk**: Low Risk (4) - No imminent collision threat.

### Conclusion
- The obstacle is moving away laterally and approaching very slowly longitudinally. The distances are large, and the trajectories do not indicate any imminent collision risk.
- This is **not** a collision scenario.
