**Obstacle-by-Obstacle Analysis at t=0.9s:**

**Obstacle 20017:**

* **Trajectory Analysis:**  Over the observed time period, Obstacle 20017 consistently moves closer to the ego vehicle longitudinally while moving further away laterally.  The longitudinal closing velocity is relatively small, while the lateral relative velocity shows a strong divergence.

* **Calculations and Reasoning:**
    * Longitudinal distance at t=0.9s: 23.52m
    * Lateral distance at t=0.9s: -3.46m (meaning 3.46m to the right)
    * Longitudinal relative velocity: -1.09 m/s (approaching)
    * Lateral relative velocity: -4.51 m/s (diverging - moving away)

    * Longitudinal TTC = 23.52m / 1.09 m/s ≈ 21.6 seconds 
    * Lateral TTC is not meaningful here as the obstacle is moving away laterally.

    * MDC: Given the trajectories, the MDC will likely be the current lateral distance, as the obstacle is moving away laterally while slowly approaching longitudinally. Therefore, MDC ≈ 3.46m.

* **Risk Assessment:**
    * Longitudinal Risk: Based on TTC (21.6s), the longitudinal risk is 5 (No Risk).
    * Lateral Risk:  Based on the diverging trajectory and increasing lateral distance, the lateral risk is 5 (No Risk).
    * Overall Risk: Considering both components and the MDC, the overall risk for Obstacle 20017 is 5 (No Risk).


**Collision Scenario Determination:**

No obstacle has a risk score of 0 or 1. Therefore, this is NOT a collision scenario.


**JSON Summary:**
