### Obstacle-by-Obstacle Analysis

#### Obstacle ID: 20017

**Trajectory Analysis and Position Changes Across Timesteps:**
- The obstacle is located in the front-right of the ego vehicle, indicating potential interaction in both longitudinal and lateral dimensions.
- The raw distances decrease incrementally in both dimensions, but lateral separation is increasing, indicating the obstacle is diverging laterally.

**Most Recent Timestep Analysis at 0.9 seconds:**
- **Adjusted Longitudinal Distance:** 23.52 meters
- **Adjusted Lateral Distance:** 3.46 meters

**Relative Velocities:**
- **Longitudinal Velocity:** -1.09 m/s (approaching)
- **Lateral Velocity:** -4.51 m/s (moving away to the right)

**Motion Description:**
- The obstacle continues to drive longitudinally toward the ego vehicle while moving away laterally to the right, denoting a divergence in the lateral path.

**Calculations:**
1. **Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC):**
   - Longitudinal path shows mutually converging due to negative relative velocity, but the wide lateral divergence reduces the immediate risk.
   - **MDC = lateral distance = 3.46 meters** (as longitudinal velocity alone would lead to convergence given enough time).

2. **Time-to-Collision (TTC):**
   - **TTC Longitudinal = 23.52 m / 1.09 m/s â‰ˆ 21.58 seconds** (long convergence time)
   - **TTC Lateral = Not applicable** as paths diverge

**Risk Assessment:**
- **MDC represents a Medium Risk (3) since it is over 3 meters but less than 5 meters.**
- **TTC is classified as No Risk (5) since > 5 seconds (21.58 seconds).**
- **Overall Risk Score:** Medium Risk (3) due to the MDC being the lower score and the lateral divergence contributing to safety.

### Conclusion
- The obstacle does not pose an immediate collision risk because the diverging lateral trajectory and considerable longitudinal distance provide a buffer.
- **No Collision nor Extreme Risk scenario exists for obstacle ID 20017.**
