Here's the analysis and the JSON output:

**Analysis:**

Both obstacles are in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle.  Let's analyze each:

* **Obstacle 20055.0:** This obstacle starts considerably ahead of the ego vehicle and maintains a roughly constant velocity and position relative to the ego vehicle.  The distance between them doesn't appear to be rapidly decreasing, suggesting no immediate collision risk. While the lateral movement described by the changing orientation should be noted, it's not causing a direct collision threat given the current longitudinal separation. This obstacle is classified as Low to Negligible risk.

* **Obstacle 20057.0:** This obstacle starts considerably behind the ego vehicle.  Although it has a slightly lower velocity than the ego vehicle, it's not gaining rapidly. The distance between them remains substantial throughout the provided timeframe. This obstacle is classified as Low to Negligible risk.
