Here's the analysis and the JSON output:

**Analysis:**

Both obstacles are in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle.  Let's examine each:

* **Obstacle 20055.0:** This obstacle starts considerably ahead and to the right of the ego vehicle and maintains a roughly parallel trajectory.  The lateral distance remains significant, and the longitudinal separation increases slightly over the observed time. This obstacle poses no immediate threat.

* **Obstacle 20057.0:** This obstacle starts considerably behind and to the left of the ego vehicle.  Like Obstacle 20055.0, it also maintains a roughly parallel trajectory.  While it is in the same lanelet, the lateral separation suggests a low risk of collision. This obstacle poses no immediate threat.

Given the observed trajectories and separations, neither obstacle presents a high risk of collision in the near future. The ego vehicle's changing orientation (decreasing values) suggests it may be turning or changing lanes, but the provided data doesn't give us information about the lanelet's geometry, so we can't determine definitively if this maneuver will lead to a collision risk.  However, based purely on the given positions and the relative speeds being similar, there's no immediate danger within the observed timeframe.
