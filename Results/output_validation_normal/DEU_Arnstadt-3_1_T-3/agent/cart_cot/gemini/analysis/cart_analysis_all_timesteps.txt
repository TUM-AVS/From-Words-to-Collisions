At t=0.9s, the ego vehicle is at (129.0691, 110.5441) with a velocity of 13.2672 and an acceleration of 0.0583.  Obstacle 20055 is at (139.917, 130.4685) with a velocity of 13.1924 and an acceleration of -0.0009. Obstacle 20057 is at (115.6629, 92.1149) with velocity 13.0905 and acceleration 0.0261.

**Analysis:**

Focusing on the last provided timestep (t=0.9s):

* **Obstacle 20055:** This obstacle is significantly further away in the y-direction (approximately 20 units) and moderately far in the x-direction (about 11 units).  Considering the current velocities, a collision is unlikely in the immediate future. Although the ego vehicle's x-velocity is slightly higher, both vehicles appear to be moving in roughly the same direction based on their relatively stable orientations. Obstacle 20055 is decelerating slightly, but this is a small value. The distance between the ego vehicle and this obstacle seems to be increasing.

* **Obstacle 20057:** This obstacle is behind the ego vehicle in the x-direction (approximately 13 units) and below it in the y-direction (approximately 18 units). Based on positions and velocities at t=0.9s, there's no immediate risk of collision with this obstacle. This obstacle also appears to be moving in roughly the same direction and is slightly accelerating, but the relative distances suggest no imminent danger.

**Calculations (at t=0.9s):**

Approximations will be used due to the complexity of precise TTC with the given data.  Since no imminent collision is apparent, precise TTC calculation is not crucial for this snapshot.

* **MDC:**  The minimum distances can be approximated using the provided Cartesian coordinates.
    * Ego to Obstacle 20055: sqrt((139.917 - 129.0691)^2 + (130.4685 - 110.5441)^2) ≈ 22.1
    * Ego to Obstacle 20057: sqrt((115.6629 - 129.0691)^2 + (92.1149 - 110.5441)^2) ≈ 22.5

Since there is no immediate risk at this timestep, we assign scores accordingly.
