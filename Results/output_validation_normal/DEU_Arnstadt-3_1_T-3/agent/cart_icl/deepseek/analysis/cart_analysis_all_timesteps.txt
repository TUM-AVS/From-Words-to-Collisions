### Analysis:

1. **Obstacle 20055.0**:
   - **Position**: (139.917, 130.4685) at 0.9s
   - **Relative Position to Ego**: Ego is at (129.0691, 110.5441), so obstacle is ahead and to the right.
   - **Distance to Ego**: ~20.5m (Euclidean distance).
   - **Relative Velocity**: Ego velocity = 13.2672 m/s, obstacle velocity = 13.1924 m/s. The relative velocity is very small (0.0748 m/s), indicating minimal closing speed.
   - **TTC**: Distance / Relative Velocity = 20.5 / 0.0748 ≈ 274s (very large, negligible risk).
   - **Risk**: **Negligible (5)**.

2. **Obstacle 20057.0**:
   - **Position**: (115.6629, 92.1149) at 0.9s
   - **Relative Position to Ego**: Ego is at (129.0691, 110.5441), so obstacle is behind and to the left.
   - **Distance to Ego**: ~20.5m (Euclidean distance).
   - **Relative Velocity**: Ego velocity = 13.2672 m/s, obstacle velocity = 13.0905 m/s. The relative velocity is 0.1767 m/s (ego is moving slightly faster).
   - **TTC**: Distance / Relative Velocity = 20.5 / 0.1767 ≈ 116s (very large, negligible risk).
   - **Risk**: **Negligible (5)**.

### Summary:
- No obstacles pose an immediate or high risk of collision.
- Both obstacles are at a safe distance with minimal relative velocity.
