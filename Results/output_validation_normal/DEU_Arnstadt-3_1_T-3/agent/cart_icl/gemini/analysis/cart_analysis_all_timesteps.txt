At t=0.9s, the ego vehicle is at (129.07, 110.54) with a velocity of 13.27 m/s and accelerating at 0.06 m/s².  Let's analyze the obstacles:

**Obstacle 20055:** Located at (139.92, 130.47), velocity 13.19 m/s, acceleration -0.0009 m/s². This obstacle is significantly north of the ego vehicle and poses no immediate threat.  While the longitudinal positions are relatively close, the large lateral separation suggests a low risk. Further calculations are needed to determine precise TTC and MDC if the trajectories were to converge, but based on current data, the risk is negligible.

**Obstacle 20057:** Located at (115.66, 92.11), velocity 13.09 m/s, acceleration 0.03 m/s². This obstacle is south of the ego vehicle and slightly behind it. Similar to Obstacle 20055, the lateral separation suggests a very low risk. The slightly lower velocity compared to the ego vehicle indicates the ego is moving away, further decreasing risk.

Given the significant lateral distances of both obstacles relative to the ego vehicle at t=0.9s, and no indication of converging trajectories, both obstacles present negligible risk.
