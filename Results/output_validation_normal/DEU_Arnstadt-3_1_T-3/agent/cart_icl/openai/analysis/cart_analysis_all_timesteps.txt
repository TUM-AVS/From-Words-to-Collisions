In this analysis, we will evaluate the potential collision risks for the ego vehicle (Ego: 20056.0) at the most recent time step (0.9 seconds) given the presence of two obstacles (Obstacle: 20055.0 and Obstacle: 20057.0) within the same lanelet.

### Ego Vehicle Data at 0.9 Seconds:
- Position: (129.0691, 110.5441)
- Orientation: 0.8642 radians
- Velocity: 13.2672 m/s
- Acceleration: 0.0583 m/s²

### Obstacle 20055.0 Data at 0.9 Seconds:
- Position: (139.917, 130.4685)
- Orientation: 1.2377 radians
- Velocity: 13.1924 m/s
- Acceleration: -0.0009 m/s²

### Obstacle 20057.0 Data at 0.9 Seconds:
- Position: (115.6629, 92.1149)
- Orientation: 0.978 radians
- Velocity: 13.0905 m/s
- Acceleration: 0.0261 m/s²

### Evaluation:

1. **Obstacle 20055.0**:
   - **Relative Position to Ego**: The obstacle is approximately 20.1 meters ahead of the ego in the Y-axis direction and 10.8 meters in X-axis direction, forming a loose oblique relation which indicates that both are maintaining separation as opposed to converging paths.
   - **Relative Velocity**: Their longitudinal speed is similar; however, the ego is slightly faster.
   - **TTC**: Calculation is difficult without converging paths, but the longitudinal and lateral distances suggest no imminent collision. Both moving in similar directions while separated.
   - **Assessment**: The large separation ensures there is no immediate risk of collision.

2. **Obstacle 20057.0**:
   - **Relative Position to Ego**: This obstacle is 17.4 meters behind the ego in Y-axis and 13.4 meters in the X-axis, which is also a well-separated position.
   - **TTC**: The relative distance of over 20 meters combined with similar velocity vectors suggests very low chances of collision focusing on current trajectory settings.
   - **Assessment**: The lack of any immediate reduction in distance makes the risk of collision negligible.

### Conclusion:

Based on the analysis, both obstacles maintain significant lateral and longitudinal separation from the ego vehicle, and no immediate converging path is visible. Hence, there is no need for immediate reactions or actions based on the current trajectory and velocities at 0.9 seconds. Therefore, the overall risk scores are determined to convey minimal risk.
