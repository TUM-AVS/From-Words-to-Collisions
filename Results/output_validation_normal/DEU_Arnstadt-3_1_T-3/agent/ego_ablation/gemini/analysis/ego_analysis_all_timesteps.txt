At t=0.9s, Obstacle 20055 is in the Front-Left of the ego vehicle at a longitudinal distance of 17.69m and a lateral distance of 3.08m. It has a relative longitudinal velocity of -0.98 m/s (approaching the ego vehicle) and a lateral velocity of 4.81 m/s (moving away from the ego vehicle).  Given the distances and the fact that it is moving away laterally, it presents a negligible risk.

Obstacle 20057, at t=0.9s, is located behind and slightly to the right of the ego vehicle at a longitudinal distance of -18.21m and a lateral distance of -0.16m. Its longitudinal velocity indicates it is moving away from the ego vehicle (-0.26m/s). While its lateral velocity (1.49m/s) suggests it's moving towards the ego vehicle laterally, the large longitudinal distance and the fact that the lateral shift is minimal mitigates the risk. Therefore, Obstacle 20057 presents a low risk.
