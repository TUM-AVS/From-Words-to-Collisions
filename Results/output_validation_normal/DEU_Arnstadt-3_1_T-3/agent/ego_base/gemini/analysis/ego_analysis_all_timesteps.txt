At t=0.9s:
- **Obstacle 20055 (Front-Left):**  This obstacle is approaching the ego car longitudinally while moving away laterally. The longitudinal distance is decreasing, but the lateral distance is increasing, suggesting a diverging path. The relative velocity and acceleration are not alarming at this point. This obstacle presents a low risk.

- **Obstacle 20057 (Rear-Right):** This obstacle is moving away longitudinally and slightly towards the ego car laterally. Given the increasing longitudinal distance and the relatively small lateral velocity, the risk associated with this obstacle is negligible.
