### Safety analysis for timestep 0.9s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

It's important to note that without specific vehicle dimensions or a clear definition of "adjusted distance," I'm assuming the provided "real distances" are already adjusted.  A robust system would use precise vehicle dimensions and sensor uncertainties to calculate adjusted distances.  Additionally, pure TTC based on constant velocity is a simplification. A real system would consider acceleration and predictive trajectories.


### Obstacle Analysis:

**- Obstacle ID: 20055**
- Distance Risk reason:  Located 17.69m longitudinally and 17.69m laterally in the front-left of the ego vehicle.  The lateral movement away from the ego vehicle reduces risk.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Without explicit ego vehicle velocity, TTC cannot be precisely calculated. However, with the obstacle moving slightly towards the ego longitudinally and significantly away laterally, and at a substantial distance, the risk is low. Approximating TTC using a reasonable ego speed would yield a large value further supporting the low risk.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

**- Obstacle ID: 20057**
- Distance Risk reason: Located 18.21m longitudinally behind and 18.21m laterally to the right and moving away longitudinally.  This presents minimal risk.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason:  The obstacle is moving away longitudinally, eliminating longitudinal collision risk. While moving laterally towards the ego vehicle, the distance and relative velocity suggest ample time to react.  Again, precise TTC is impossible without ego velocity.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4
