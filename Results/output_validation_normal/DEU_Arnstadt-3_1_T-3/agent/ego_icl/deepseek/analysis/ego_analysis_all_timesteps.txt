### Obstacle-by-Obstacle Analysis

#### Obstacle 20055 (Front-left of the ego car)
- **Adjusted Distance (most recent timestep):** Longitudinal 17.69 m, Lateral 3.08 m  
- **Relative Velocity:** Longitudinal -0.98 m/s (approaching), Lateral 4.81 m/s (moving away)  
- **Motion Description:** Obstacle is driving toward the ego car longitudinally but moving away laterally to the left.  

**Trajectory Analysis:**
- The obstacle has been consistently moving toward the ego car longitudinally with a decreasing distance (from 18.32 m to 17.69 m over 0.9 seconds).  
- Laterally, the obstacle is moving away from the ego car (lateral distance increasing from 0.00 m to 3.08 m).  

**Time-to-Collision (TTC):**
- Longitudinal TTC = 17.69 / 0.98 ≈ 18.05 seconds (No Risk, TTC > 5.0s)  
- Lateral TTC = Not applicable (moving away).  

**Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC):**
- The obstacle is moving away laterally, so the risk is primarily longitudinal.  
- MDC (longitudinal) = 17.69 m (No Risk, MDC > 5.0m).  

**Overall Risk Assessment:**  
- The obstacle is moving toward the ego car longitudinally but at a very slow rate and with a large distance. Laterally, it is moving away.  
- **Overall Risk Score: 5 (Negligible Risk)**

#### Obstacle 20057 (Rear-right of the ego car)
- **Adjusted Distance (most recent timestep):** Longitudinal -18.21 m, Lateral -0.16 m  
- **Relative Velocity:** Longitudinal -0.26 m/s (moving away), Lateral 1.49 m/s (approaching)  
- **Motion Description:** Obstacle is moving away longitudinally but driving toward the ego car laterally from the right.  

**Trajectory Analysis:**
- The obstacle is moving away longitudinally (distance increasing from -18.22 m to -18.21 m).  
- Laterally, it is approaching the ego car (lateral distance decreasing from 0.00 m to -0.16 m).  

**Time-to-Collision (TTC):**
- Longitudinal TTC = Not applicable (moving away).  
- Lateral TTC = 0.16 / 1.49 ≈ 0.107 seconds (Extreme Risk, TTC < 0.5s).  

**Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC):**
- The primary risk is lateral.  
- MDC (lateral) = 0.16 m (Extreme Risk, MDC < 0.5m).  

**Overall Risk Assessment:**  
- The obstacle is very close laterally and approaching rapidly, posing an extreme risk of collision.  
- **Overall Risk Score: 1 (Extreme Risk)**
