Here's the detailed analysis of the most recent timestep (0.9 seconds) for obstacles 20055 and 20057:

### Obstacle 20055 Analysis

**Position and Motion:**
- At 0.9 seconds, the obstacle 20055 is in the Front-left relative to the ego vehicle.
- Adjusted longitudinal distance: 17.69 meters.
- Adjusted lateral distance: 3.08 meters.
- Relative velocity: Longitudinal -0.98 m/s (closing), Lateral 4.81 m/s (moving away to the left).
- The obstacle is driving toward the ego vehicle longitudinally but diverging laterally.

**Trajectory Analysis:**
- Across previous timesteps, the obstacle's longitudinal position consistently moved closer to the ego vehicle, confirming a converging trajectory in terms of longitudinal distance.
- Lateral distance has been increasing, indicating the obstacle is diverging in the lateral direction, which reduces lateral collision risk.

**Time-to-Collision (TTC) and Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC) Calculations:**
- Longitudinal TTC ≈ 17.69m / 0.98m/s ≈ 18.06 seconds (indicating a very long time until potential intersection, suggesting divergence).
- Lateral TTC is not applicable as the obstacle is moving away laterally.
- MDC assessment using the lateral distance trend supports limited collision risk due to diverging paths.

**Risk Assessment:**
- Longitudinal TTC > 5 seconds and diverging lateral trajectory indicate no significant risk.
- Conclusion: Risk level for obstacle 20055 is Negligible Risk (5).

### Obstacle 20057 Analysis

**Position and Motion:**
- At 0.9 seconds, obstacle 20057 is in the Rear-right relative to the ego vehicle.
- Adjusted longitudinal distance: -18.21 meters.
- Adjusted lateral distance: -0.16 meters.
- Relative velocity: Longitudinal -0.26 m/s (moving away), Lateral 1.49 m/s (approaching).
- The obstacle is moving away longitudinally but is approaching laterally from the right.

**Trajectory Analysis:**
- The obstacle's longitudinal distance remains relatively stable, consistently moving slightly further away from the ego vehicle.
- Lateral position shows a trend of slightly decreasing distance, indicating a mild lateral approach.

**Time-to-Collision (TTC) and Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC) Calculations:**
- Longitudinal TTC is not applicable as the obstacle is moving away.
- Lateral TTC calculation is approximately 0.16m / 1.49m/s ≈ 0.11 seconds. This very short time indicates a potential immediate proximity risk, though majorly lateral.
- MDC approximately 0.16m supports a potential lateral interaction risk.

**Risk Assessment:**
- Short lateral TTC combined with side proximity and slight approach indicates Extreme Risk.
- Conclusion: Risk level for obstacle 20057 is Extreme Risk (1).

### Conclusion

- Obstacle 20055 shows no significant collision risk due to diverging lateral distance and a long longitudinal TTC.
- Obstacle 20057 exhibits Extreme Risk due to a very short lateral TTC, posing an immediate trajectory crossing threat.
