At t=0.9s, Ego is at (129.07, 110.54) and obstacle 20055 is at (139.92, 130.47), obstacle 20057 is at (115.66, 92.11).

Obstacle 20055 is significantly further away in the y-direction (almost 20 units) and about 11 units away in the x-direction. While the x-distance is closing due to the cars' similar velocities, the large y-separation and the consistent trajectory patterns so far suggest no immediate collision risk.

Obstacle 20057 is behind and to the side of the Ego vehicle.  While it's closer than obstacle 20055, the trajectories indicate a safe distance and no immediate risk.

Therefore, neither obstacle presents a collision or extreme risk.
