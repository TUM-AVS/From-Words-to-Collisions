At t=0.9s, Ego (20056.0) is at (129.0691, 110.5441) and obstacle 20055.0 is at (139.917, 130.4685), while obstacle 20057.0 is at (115.6629, 92.1149).

Obstacle 20055.0, while in the same lanelet, is significantly ahead and to the right of the ego vehicle, posing no immediate threat.  Obstacle 20057.0 is behind and to the left of the ego vehicle, also posing no immediate threat. The ego vehicle's rapid change in orientation suggests a potential lane change or turn, but based on the current positions and velocities, no collision or extreme risk is present at this timestep.
