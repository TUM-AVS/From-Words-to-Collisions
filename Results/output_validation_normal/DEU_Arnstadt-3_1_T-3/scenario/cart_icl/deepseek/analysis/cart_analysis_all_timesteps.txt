### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep:

### Obstacle Analysis:
#### Obstacle ID: 20055.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is ahead of the ego vehicle, moving in the same lanelet (2972.0). The distance between them is increasing over time (from ~14.33m at 0.1s to ~10.85m at 0.9s), indicating the obstacle is moving away.
- **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
- **Time Risk reason**: The relative velocity is small (ego: 13.2672 m/s, obstacle: 13.1924 m/s), and the obstacle is decelerating slightly. TTC is large due to increasing distance.
- **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
- **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low Risk)

#### Obstacle ID: 20057.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is behind the ego vehicle, moving in the same lanelet (2972.0). The distance between them is increasing over time (from ~11.98m at 0.1s to ~13.43m at 0.9s), indicating the obstacle is moving away.
- **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
- **Time Risk reason**: The relative velocity is small (ego: 13.2672 m/s, obstacle: 13.0905 m/s), and the obstacle is accelerating slightly. TTC is large due to increasing distance.
- **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
- **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low Risk)

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. Both obstacles are in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle.
2. Over the 9 timesteps, the distance to both obstacles is increasing, indicating they are moving away from the ego vehicle.
3. The relative velocities are small, and the acceleration/deceleration trends do not suggest an imminent collision.
4. No obstacles are on a collision course with the ego vehicle at the most recent timestep.
