Obstacle 20055 is moving longitudinally towards the ego vehicle, but it is also moving laterally away from the ego vehicle to the left.  At the most recent timestep (0.9 seconds), it is 17.69m ahead and 3.08m to the left. While the longitudinal motion is towards the ego vehicle, the increasing lateral distance suggests decreasing risk.

Obstacle 20057 is moving longitudinally away from the ego vehicle. It is also moving laterally towards the ego vehicle from the right. At the latest timestep, it is 18.21m behind and 0.16m to the right.  The longitudinal motion away from the ego vehicle indicates low risk, and the lateral motion, while towards the ego vehicle, is from a substantial longitudinal distance.

Neither obstacle presents an immediate collision risk.
