### Safety analysis for timestep 0.9 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

**Missing Information:** The provided scenario lacks crucial information for accurate TTC and MDC calculation.  We need ego vehicle speed and obstacle sizes to adjust the distances.  I will perform the analysis based on the *unadjusted* distances, but the results will be less reliable.  Also, lateral TTC is difficult to determine without knowing the precise paths of the vehicles. I will make assumptions based on the provided descriptions of motion.

### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 20055**
- Distance Risk reason:  Located 17.69m in front and to the left of the ego vehicle.  The obstacle is moving closer longitudinally but further away laterally.
- Distance safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
- Time Risk reason: Without ego vehicle speed, TTClong cannot be accurately calculated. However, since the longitudinal relative velocity is negative (obstacle approaching), there is some risk. Lateral motion suggests increasing separation, reducing lateral risk.
- Time safety score: 4 (Low Risk - Assuming moderate ego speed, there is some time to react to the longitudinal movement)
- Overall Risk score: 4 (Low Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 20057**
- Distance Risk reason: Located 18.21m behind and to the right of the ego vehicle. The obstacle is moving further away longitudinally.
- Distance safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- Time Risk reason:  Longitudinal motion is away from the ego vehicle. While lateral motion is towards the ego vehicle, the distance and relative velocity suggest ample time to react.
- Time safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 5 (Negligible Risk)


### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
  "CollisionObstacle": null,
  "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null,
  "IsCollisionScenario": false,
  "Justification": "No immediate collision is detected. While Obstacle 20055 is approaching longitudinally, it is also moving laterally away from the ego vehicle and at a safe distance. Obstacle 20057 is moving away from the ego vehicle both longitudinally and laterally."
}
```

**Important Note:**  This analysis is based on unadjusted distances due to missing obstacle size information. Providing obstacle dimensions and ego vehicle speed is essential for a more precise collision risk assessment.  Accurate lateral TTC calculations require more information about the trajectories of the vehicles.  The assumptions made regarding lateral motion should be validated with more complete data.
