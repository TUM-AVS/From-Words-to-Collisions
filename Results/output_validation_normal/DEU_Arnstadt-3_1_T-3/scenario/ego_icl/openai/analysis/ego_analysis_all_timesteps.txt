### Obstacle Risk Assessment

#### Obstacle 20055
**Trajectory Analysis:**
- Position: Front-left of the ego vehicle
- Adjusted longitudinal distance changes from 18.32m to 17.69m (approaching)
- Adjusted lateral distance increases from 0.00m to 3.08m (moving leftward away laterally)
- Relative velocity: Longitudinally -0.98 m/s (approaching), Lateral 4.81 m/s (moving leftward away)

**Risk Calculation:**
- **Longitudinal TTC:** 
  - Distance = 17.69m, Velocity = 0.98 m/s
  - TTC = 17.69 / 0.98 ≈ 18.06 seconds
- **Lateral TTC:** 
  - Distance = 3.08m, Velocity = 4.81 m/s (moving away laterally)
  - With ego clearance normally increasing, no collision
- **MDC:** 
  - Lateral distance is increasing, hence less critical
  - Longitudinal minimum distance at closest point remains >5m if trajectory maintained

**Risk Score:**
- Longitudinal motion close, but significantly mitigated by growing lateral spacing
- **Overall Risk Score:** 5 (No Risk)

#### Obstacle 20057
**Trajectory Analysis:**
- Position: Rear-right of the ego vehicle
- Adjusted longitudinal distance remains relatively stable with slight decrease due to vehicle divergence
- Adjusted lateral distance changes from approximately 0.00m to -0.16m (approaching from the right)
- Relative velocity: Longitudinal -0.26 m/s (slowly moving away), Lateral 1.49 m/s (moving leftward toward the ego)

**Risk Calculation:**
- **Longitudinal TTC:**
  - Distance ≈ 18.21m, Velocity ≈ 0.26 m/s (increasing gap)
  - Current relative movement away longitudinally
  - Longitudinal alignment, but increasing distance, so TTC is not applicable
- **Lateral TTC:**
  - Distance = 0.16m, Velocity = 1.49 m/s
  - TTC = 0.16 / 1.49 ≈ 0.11 seconds (lateral convergence ongoing)
- **MDC:**
  - As lateral spacing decreases rapidly, MDC is critical
  - Negative lateral change, indicated for possible impact along path projection

**Risk Score:**
- Closest approach in the lateral is critical; nearly aligns with ego clearance
- **Overall Risk Score:** 1 (Extreme Risk)

### Conclusion
- **Obstacle 20055:** Shows no immediate risk despite approaching
- **Obstacle 20057:** Extreme risk due to rear-right lateral approach aligning critically close approaching crossing path
- **Scenario Evaluation:** Presence of extreme-risk obstacle indicates potential collision scenario
