The ego vehicle and obstacle 20054.0 are in the same lanelet (1088.0).  The obstacle is significantly behind the ego vehicle initially. However, the ego vehicle is decelerating more rapidly than the obstacle in the first few timesteps.  While both are decelerating, the distance between them is decreasing.

Analyzing the positions:

* **t=0.1s:** Ego at (21.0414, 52.9708), Obstacle at (21.6675, 36.3203).  The y-coordinates show a significant separation.
* **t=0.9s:** Ego at (21.2035, 48.6593), Obstacle at (21.7918, 33.0133). The y-coordinate difference is still large, but has decreased.

Although the distance is closing, over the 0.9 seconds analyzed, a collision hasn't occurred and doesn't appear imminent in the next few tenths of a second.  The rate of deceleration of both vehicles would need to be considered for a longer-term prediction, but based on this short timeframe, we can categorize the risk as medium (or possibly low if more data confirms the deceleration trends).
