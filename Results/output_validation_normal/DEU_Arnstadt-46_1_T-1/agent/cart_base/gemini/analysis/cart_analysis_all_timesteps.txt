The ego vehicle and the obstacle (20054.0) are in the same lanelet (1088.0).  The obstacle is significantly behind the ego vehicle initially. However, the ego vehicle is decelerating more rapidly than the obstacle, especially in the earlier timesteps.  We need to consider the closing distance and velocities to assess risk.

Looking at the positions, the y-coordinate (which seems to represent the longitudinal position along the lanelet) shows the ego vehicle approaching the obstacle. The difference in their y-positions is decreasing over time:

* t=0.1s:  52.9708 - 36.3203 = 16.6505
* t=0.2s:  52.2781 - 35.7514 = 16.5267
* t=0.3s:  51.6316 - 35.2413 = 16.3903
* t=0.4s:  51.0306 - 34.79 = 16.2406
* t=0.5s:  50.4709 - 34.3975 = 16.0734
* t=0.6s:  49.9603 - 34.0386 = 15.9217
* t=0.7s:  49.4913 - 33.6883 = 15.803
* t=0.8s:  49.056 - 33.3465 = 15.7095
* t=0.9s:  48.6593 - 33.0133 = 15.646


The x-coordinates also show some lateral movement, but they remain relatively constant, suggesting the vehicles are largely in the same lateral position within the lane. While the distance is decreasing, the rate of decrease is slowing down, and both vehicles are decelerating.  There's no immediate indication of a collision within the provided timeframe, but continued monitoring is needed, especially if deceleration rates change. The risk appears to be medium (3) or low (4) within the predicted timeframe, but further prediction beyond 0.9 seconds is required to definitively rule out a collision.
