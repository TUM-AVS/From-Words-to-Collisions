At t=0.9s, the ego vehicle is at (21.2035, 48.6593) with a velocity of 3.5334 and the obstacle (ID: 20054.0) is at (21.7918, 33.0133) with a velocity of 3.2921. Both are in the same lanelet (1088.0).  The obstacle is significantly behind the ego vehicle in the Y direction (longitudinal), but slightly offset in the X direction (lateral).

**Analysis and Calculations:**

1. **Longitudinal TTC:** Since the obstacle is behind the ego vehicle and both are moving in roughly the same direction (similar orientations), a rear-end collision is unlikely.  The ego vehicle is decelerating more rapidly than the obstacle, but the difference in speeds is not drastic enough to cause a collision within the near future.

2. **Lateral TTC:** There is a lateral offset between the ego vehicle and obstacle.  However, given the relatively small offset and the similar orientations of the vehicles, a lateral collision is also improbable in the immediate future.

3. **MDC:** The distance between the ego vehicle and obstacle at t=0.9s is approximately sqrt((21.7918 - 21.2035)^2 + (48.6593 - 33.0133)^2) = 15.66 meters.


**Reasoning and Predictions:**

Based on the available data, the obstacle poses no immediate collision risk to the ego vehicle.  Although both vehicles are decelerating, their relative speeds and positions suggest that they are moving away from each other longitudinally, and the lateral offset is not significant enough to cause a lateral collision in the short term.

Given the current trajectories, it is highly improbable that the obstacle will collide with the ego vehicle.  Therefore, the risk score for the obstacle is 5 (Negligible Risk).
