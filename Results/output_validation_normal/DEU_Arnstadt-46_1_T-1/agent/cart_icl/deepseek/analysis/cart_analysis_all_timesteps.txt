### Analysis:

1. **Ego Vehicle (ID: 20055.0)**:
   - Position: (21.2035, 48.6593) at 0.9s
   - Orientation: -1.533 rad (~ -87.8°)
   - Velocity: 3.5334 m/s (decelerating)
   - Acceleration: -1.2695 m/s²

2. **Obstacle (ID: 20054.0)**:
   - Position: (21.7918, 33.0133) at 0.9s
   - Orientation: -1.5332 rad (~ -87.8°)
   - Velocity: 3.2921 m/s (decelerating)
   - Acceleration: -0.8542 m/s²

### Relative Motion:
- **Longitudinal Distance**: 
  - At 0.9s, the obstacle is ahead of the ego by approximately 15.646 m (calculated as sqrt((21.7918 - 21.2035)² + (33.0133 - 48.6593)²)).
- **Relative Velocity**: 
  - Ego velocity: 3.5334 m/s
  - Obstacle velocity: 3.2921 m/s
  - Relative velocity: 0.2413 m/s (ego is closing in slowly)
- **TTC (Time to Collision)**:
  - TTC = Distance / Relative Velocity = 15.646 / 0.2413 ≈ 64.84 s (very long, no immediate risk)
- **Lateral Distance**:
  - Both vehicles are in the same lanelet (1088.0) and have nearly identical orientations, suggesting they are aligned in the same lane.

### Risk Assessment:
- The obstacle is ahead of the ego and moving in the same direction with a very small relative velocity. The TTC is extremely high (64.84 s), indicating no immediate risk of collision. The lateral distance is negligible since both are in the same lanelet. The ego is decelerating, further reducing the risk.

### Conclusion:
- The obstacle poses **Negligible Risk (5)** as there is no significant risk of collision given the current trajectories and velocities.
