At t=0.9s, the ego vehicle is at (21.20, 48.66) with a velocity of 3.53 m/s and decelerating at -1.27 m/s².  The obstacle (ID 20054) is at (21.79, 33.01) with a velocity of 3.29 m/s and decelerating at -0.85 m/s².

Both are in the same lanelet (1088).  The obstacle is significantly behind the ego vehicle in the longitudinal direction (based on their Y-coordinates and similar orientations). The lateral distance (difference in X-coordinates) is approximately 0.59m, which is quite close. However, since the ego vehicle is moving faster and both are decelerating, the risk of collision appears low.

To be more precise, let's approximate TTC:

* **Relative Longitudinal Position:** 33.01 - 48.66 = -15.65m (obstacle is behind)
* **Relative Longitudinal Velocity:** 3.29 - 3.53 = -0.24 m/s (ego is moving away faster). If Obstacle velocity < Ego velocity and both decelerate, risk is reduced.

Since the ego is moving away from the obstacle, a simple TTC calculation (-15.65 / -0.24 = 65.2s) doesn't fully represent the scenario.  It suggests a large TTC, but doesn't account for the lateral proximity.  The minimal lateral distance needs to be considered. Although unlikely given the current decelerations, if both vehicles were to stop, the MDC would be approx 0.59 which is relatively high risk.  To assess the actual level of risk, we can use a score between 3 and 4, since there are no clear indicators of any future lane changes or other possible maneuvers not included in this specific scenario.

Given that both vehicles are decelerating and the Ego vehicle is moving away, a medium risk will be assigned.
