### Analysis

**Overview**:

- At the most recent timestep (0.9 seconds), the ego vehicle (ID 20055.0) and the obstacle vehicle (ID 20054.0) are both within the same lanelet (1088.0).
- The ego vehicle is at position (21.2035, 48.6593) moving with a velocity of 3.5334 m/s and decelerating.
- The obstacle vehicle is at position (21.7918, 33.0133) moving with a velocity of 3.2921 m/s and a smaller deceleration.

**Relative Motion and Trajectory**:

- Longitudinal Position (relative gap in Y direction): 
  - Ego Y-position = 48.6593
  - Obstacle Y-position = 33.0133
  - Relative longitudinal position = 48.6593 - 33.0133 = 15.646 meters (obstacle is behind)

- Longitudinal Velocity:
  - Ego velocity = 3.5334 m/s
  - Obstacle velocity = 3.2921 m/s
  - Relative velocity = 3.5334 - 3.2921 = 0.2413 m/s (positive, ego is moving slightly faster)

- **TTC Calculation**:
  - TTC = Relative position / Relative velocity = 15.646 / 0.2413 = 64.84 seconds (obstacle behind and not closing the gap rapidly)

- **MDC Assessment**:
  - Since the vehicles are in the same lanelet, assessing lateral movement is less significant as they align longitudinally.

**Risk Evaluation**:
- Given the obstacle is significantly behind the ego vehicle and the rate of closure is minimal, there is no immediate threat to the ego vehicle over the time horizon given.
- The vehicles are moving in the same direction, reducing chances of a sudden collision without external interference or sudden changes.

**Conclusion**:

- There is negligible risk for collision since the relative positions and velocities indicate that they maintain a safe distance from each other within the observed horizon, even if remaining in the same lanelet.
