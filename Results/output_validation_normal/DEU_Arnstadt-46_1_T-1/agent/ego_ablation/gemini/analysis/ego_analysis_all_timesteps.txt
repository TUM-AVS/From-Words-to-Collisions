At t=0.9s, obstacle 20054 is 11.15m directly in front of the ego vehicle and moving towards the ego vehicle at -0.24 m/s longitudinally. While the obstacle is relatively far away and closing slowly, the consistent longitudinal closing behavior over the provided timesteps warrants attention. The lateral relative velocity is negligible, suggesting minimal lateral movement risk. Given the longitudinal closing speed and distance, a low-risk assessment is appropriate. The ego vehicle has sufficient time and distance to react, such as braking or maneuvering, to avoid a potential collision. However, continued monitoring is necessary to ensure safety. The relatively low closing velocity and safe distance indicate no immediate collision risk. Overall, the obstacle poses a low risk at this specific timestep, given the available data.
