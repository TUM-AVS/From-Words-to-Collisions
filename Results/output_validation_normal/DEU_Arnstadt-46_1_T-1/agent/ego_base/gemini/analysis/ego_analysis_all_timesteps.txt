At t=0.9s, Obstacle 20054 is in front of the ego vehicle, at a longitudinal distance of 11.15m and lateral distance of 0.00m.  The relative longitudinal velocity is -0.24 m/s, meaning it is still approaching the ego vehicle, albeit slowly. The relative longitudinal acceleration is 0.02 m/sÂ², indicating the closing speed is slightly increasing.  While the obstacle is still moving towards the ego vehicle, the rate is very slow.  Given the current distance and slow relative velocity, a collision is not imminent, but the situation warrants monitoring.  I'd classify this as a medium risk for now.
