### Safety analysis for timestep 0.9s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 20054
- Distance Risk reason: At 0.9 seconds, Obstacle 20054 is 11.15m in front and 11.15m lateral distance from the ego vehicle. While the distance is significant, the obstacle's continuous motion towards the ego vehicle warrants attention.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason:  The obstacle's longitudinal velocity is negative and decreasing towards 0 and the lateral velocity is 0. If it maintains this deceleration pattern, the relative longitudinal velocity may become 0, increasing the risk of collision in subsequent time steps.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3
