### Obstacle Analysis: Obstacle 20054

#### Trajectory Analysis (0.1s to 0.9s):
- **Longitudinal Distance**: Decreasing from 12.15m to 11.15m over 0.9s (1.0m decrease)
- **Lateral Distance**: Consistently 0.00m (exact lateral alignment)
- **Relative Velocity (Longitudinal)**: Initially -0.74 m/s, peaking at -1.21 m/s, then decreasing to -0.24 m/s (slowing approach)
- **Relative Acceleration (Longitudinal)**: Mostly negative (decelerating approach), then slightly positive at last timesteps
- **Motion Description**: "Obstacle is driving toward the ego car longitudinally" with exact lateral alignment

#### Most Recent Timestep (0.9s):
- **Adjusted Longitudinal Distance**: 11.15m (assuming adjusted ≈ raw as not provided)
- **Adjusted Lateral Distance**: 0.00m
- **Relative Velocity (Longitudinal)**: -0.24 m/s (approaching slowly)
- **Relative Acceleration (Longitudinal)**: +0.02 m/s² (slightly decelerating approach)

#### Risk Assessment:
1. **Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC)**:
   - Lateral MDC = 0.00m (same lane), but longitudinal MDC = 11.15m
   - Since obstacle is longitudinally approaching, primary risk is from longitudinal dimension.
   - MDC = 11.15m → **Risk 5 (Negligible)** per scale (MDC > 5.0m)

2. **Time-to-Collision (TTC)**:
   - TTC = Distance / |Relative Velocity| = 11.15m / 0.24 m/s ≈ 46.46s
   - TTC ≈ 46.46s → **Risk 5 (Negligible)** per scale (TTC > 5.0s)

3. **Acceleration Trend**:
   - Relative acceleration is slightly positive (+0.02 m/s²), meaning approach is decelerating further.

4. **Overall Risk**:
   - Both MDC and TTC indicate **Negligible Risk (5)**.
   - No collision or extreme risk observed.
