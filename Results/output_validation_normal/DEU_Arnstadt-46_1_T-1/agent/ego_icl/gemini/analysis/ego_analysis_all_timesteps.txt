Obstacle 20054 is consistently in front of the ego vehicle and laterally aligned (0.00 m lateral distance) throughout all timesteps. The longitudinal distance decreases from 12.15 m to 11.15 m over 0.9 seconds, indicating the obstacle is approaching the ego vehicle. The relative longitudinal velocity is negative, meaning obstacle is moving towards the ego vehicle and confirming the closing distance.


At the last timestep (0.9 seconds):

- Longitudinal distance: 11.15 m
- Lateral distance: 0.00 m
- Relative longitudinal velocity: -0.24 m/s
- Relative lateral velocity: -0.00 m/s

TTC Calculation:

Longitudinal TTC = 11.15 m / |-0.24 m/s| = 46.46 s

Since the lateral distance is 0.00 m, we can use the longitudinal distance as the MDC.  MDC = 11.15 m

Risk Assessment:

Based on MDC (11.15 m) and longitudinal TTC (46.46 s), the risk level for Obstacle 20054 is 5 (Negligible Risk).
