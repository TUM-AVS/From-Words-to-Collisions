### Obstacle-by-Obstacle Analysis

#### Obstacle 20054
- **Trajectory Analysis:**
  - The obstacle is consistently moving toward the ego vehicle in a longitudinal direction over the observed time period.
  - Longitudinal distances have decreased sequentially across time steps from 12.15m to 11.15m, indicating that the obstacle is closing the distance with the ego vehicle.
  - Exact lateral alignment is maintained throughout, given that lateral distance is consistently 0.00m.

- **Most Recent Timestep Analysis (0.9 seconds):**
  - **Adjusted Longitudinal Distance:** 11.15 meters
  - **Adjusted Lateral Distance:** 0.00 meters; implies same-lane alignment but not necessarily collision.
  - **Relative Longitudinal Velocity:** -0.24 m/s; indicates the obstacle is moving toward the ego vehicle, but at a decelerating rate.
  - **Relative Longitudinal Acceleration:** 0.02 m/s²; indicates slight acceleration leading to decreased approach rate.
  - **Relative Lateral Velocity:** -0.00 m/s; no lateral movement relative to the ego.

- **Time-to-Collision (TTC) Calculation:**
  - TTC (longitudinal) = 11.15m / |0.24 m/s| ≈ 46.46 seconds

- **Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC) Calculation:**
  - Given no lateral movement and a significant longitudinal distance, MDC focuses on longitudinal approach.
  - MDC essentially equates to the longitudinal distance since no lateral change is present.
  - MDC = 11.15m

- **Risk Assessment:**
  - Longitudinal TTC of 46.46 seconds puts the risk at a negligible level by temporal estimation.
  - Longitudinal MDC of 11.15 meters aligns with a negligible risk as physical proximity estimates.
  - Despite exact lateral alignment, no imminent risk is presented due to considerable longitudinal spacing.
  - Consistent slowing approach minimizes collision likelihood further.

**Conclusion:** The overall risk for Obstacle 20054 is negligible, classified under the highest numerical risk (lowest caution required).
