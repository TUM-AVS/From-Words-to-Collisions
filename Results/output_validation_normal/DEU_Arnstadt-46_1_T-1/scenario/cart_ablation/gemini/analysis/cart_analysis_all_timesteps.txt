At t=0.9s, the ego vehicle is at (21.2035, 48.6593) and the obstacle is at (21.7918, 33.0133). Both are in the same lanelet (1088.0). While the x-coordinates are relatively close, the y-coordinates are significantly different, suggesting a substantial longitudinal separation.  Furthermore, both ego and obstacle are decelerating. Based on the provided data, a collision is unlikely in the immediate future.
