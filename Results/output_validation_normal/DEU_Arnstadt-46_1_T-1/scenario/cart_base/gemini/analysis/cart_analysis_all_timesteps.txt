At t=0.9s, the ego vehicle is at (21.2035, 48.6593) and the obstacle is at (21.7918, 33.0133). Both are in the same lanelet (1088.0).  While the x-coordinates are relatively close, the y-coordinates are significantly different, indicating a substantial longitudinal separation.  Furthermore, both the ego and the obstacle are decelerating.  Examining the trajectories from previous timesteps confirms this trend of increasing longitudinal separation.  Thus, a collision is not imminent.
