### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 20054.0
- Distance Risk reason: At the last timestep (0.9 seconds), the obstacle is approximately 15.6 meters away longitudinally (21.7918 - 21.2035 â‰ˆ 0.5883 in x-coordinate, and the vehicles are in the same lanelet)  and 15.6 meters away in the y-direction (53.6902-33.0133). Considering they are in the same lane, the longitudinal distance is more relevant. While not immediately close, the obstacle's and ego vehicle's consistent deceleration and same lane suggest a possible future collision risk if this trend continues. More data points in future timesteps are required to assess with greater certainty.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: Both the ego vehicle and the obstacle are decelerating.  The ego vehicle's deceleration seems to be less severe in the recent timesteps than the obstacle.  However,  the continuous deceleration and the relatively small distance, as well as being in the same lanelet and travelling roughly the same direction means we have to observe the situation closely.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. **Identify the most critical obstacles:** Obstacle 20054.0 is the only obstacle identified within the same lanelet as the ego vehicle and thus presents the most critical risk.
2. **Analyze their trajectories over all 10 timesteps:** Both the ego vehicle and Obstacle 20054.0 are moving in the same general direction (orientations are nearly identical) and decelerating. The obstacle is consistently ahead of the ego vehicle in the same lanelet.
3. **Evaluate relative positions, velocities, and accelerations:** The longitudinal distance between the ego vehicle and the obstacle appears relatively small, though not immediately dangerous.  Both are decelerating, which, if continues at similar rates and within the same lanelet, could lead to an eventual collision.
4. **Determine if any collision has occurred or is imminent:** Based on the provided data, a collision has not occurred within the first 0.9 seconds.  However,  a collision in the near future is possible given the similar trajectories, decelerations and reducing longitudinal distance between obstacle and ego vehicle within the same lane.
5. **Reasoning for your conclusion:** The consistent deceleration of both vehicles, their proximity within the same lanelet, and the decreasing trend in their longitudinal distance suggest a medium risk of a collision.  Further observation of the trajectories and behaviours in the subsequent seconds is crucial to accurately determine the imminence of a collision.

  "CollisionObstacles": [],

    "IsCollisionScenario": false,
    "Reasoning": "While a collision hasn't occurred in the first 0.9 seconds, both the ego vehicle and Obstacle 20054.0 are decelerating within the same lanelet, with the ego vehicle approaching the obstacle from behind.  Continuous deceleration and the decreasing longitudinal distance between the obstacle and the ego vehicle raise the risk of collision, but the observed data is insufficient to deem a collision imminent."
