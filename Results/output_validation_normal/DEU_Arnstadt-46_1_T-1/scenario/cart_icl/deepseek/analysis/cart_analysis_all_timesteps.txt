### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:
- **Obstacle ID**: 20054.0  
  - **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is in the same lanelet (1088.0) as the ego vehicle but is significantly behind (Y-coordinate difference: ~15.646). The distance has been increasing over time (from ~17.3699 at 0.1s to ~15.646 at 0.9s), indicating the obstacle is moving away.  
  - **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)  
  - **Time Risk reason**: The relative velocity (ego: 3.5334 m/s, obstacle: 3.2921 m/s) is small, and the obstacle is decelerating faster (-0.8542 m/s² vs. ego's -1.2695 m/s²). TTC is effectively infinite as the distance is increasing.  
  - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)  
  - **Overall Risk score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)  

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. **Lanelet Check**: Both ego and obstacle are in lanelet 1088.0, but the obstacle is far behind.  
2. **Trajectory Trend**: Over 0.1s–0.9s, the Y-distance between ego and obstacle increases (17.37 → 15.65), confirming divergence.  
3. **Velocity/Acceleration**: Ego is slowing faster than the obstacle, further reducing collision risk.  
4. **Conclusion**: No collision risk.
