- Obstacle ID: 20049.0
- Distance Risk reason: Far away, but starting to move. Low risk currently.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Moving slowly and not towards ego. Low risk.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- Obstacle ID: 20050.0
- Distance Risk reason: Relatively far and moving.  Moderate Risk currently.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: Moving perpendicularly to ego and away in x direction. Low risk.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4


- Obstacle ID: 20054.0
- Distance Risk reason: Same lane, but sufficiently far behind.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Moving slower than ego and decelerating significantly. Low risk currently.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4


### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
No obstacles pose an immediate collision risk.  Obstacle 20054 is in the same lane and behind the ego vehicle, but decelerating faster than the ego vehicle. The other obstacles are in different lanelets and pose no immediate threat. Thus, this is not a collision scenario.


### Summary in JSON Format:

{
  "CollisionObstacles": null,
  "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null,
  "ScenarioAnalysis": {
    "IsCollisionScenario": false,
    "Reasoning": "No obstacle is on a collision course with the ego vehicle.  All obstacles are either stationary and far away, in different lanelets, or moving away from the ego vehicle."
