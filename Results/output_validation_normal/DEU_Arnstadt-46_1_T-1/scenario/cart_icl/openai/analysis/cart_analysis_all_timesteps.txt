### Obstacle Analysis:

1. **Obstacle ID: 20026.0**
   - **Distance Risk Reason**: With constant position and no movement since the beginning, it's far from the Ego vehicle's path.
   - **Distance Safety Score**: 5
   - **Time Risk Reason**: Velocity and acceleration remain zero, implying no chance of collision.
   - **Time Safety Score**: 5
   - **Overall Risk Score**: 5

2. **Obstacle ID: 20029.0**
   - **Distance Risk Reason**: Stationary and not in Ego's lanelet; far from Ego's path.
   - **Distance Safety Score**: 5
   - **Time Risk Reason**: No movement; remains stationary throughout the scenario.
   - **Time Safety Score**: 5
   - **Overall Risk Score**: 5

3. **Obstacle ID: 20034.0**
   - **Distance Risk Reason**: Similarly stationary as Obstacle 20029, and outside Ego’s path.
   - **Distance Safety Score**: 5
   - **Time Risk Reason**: No movement or acceleration.
   - **Time Safety Score**: 5
   - **Overall Risk Score**: 5

4. **Obstacle ID: 20037.0**
   - **Distance Risk Reason**: No movement, not positioned on Ego's lanelet or path.
   - **Distance Safety Score**: 5
   - **Time Risk Reason**: Velocity remains zero.
   - **Time Safety Score**: 5
   - **Overall Risk Score**: 5

5. **Obstacle ID: 20042.0**
   - **Distance Risk Reason**: Continues with zero velocity and is not on a collision course with the Ego.
   - **Distance Safety Score**: 5
   - **Time Risk Reason**: No changes in velocity or position relative to the Ego.
   - **Time Safety Score**: 5
   - **Overall Risk Score**: 5

6. **Obstacle ID: 20049.0**
   - **Distance Risk Reason**: Minimal movement and far from Ego’s trajectory.
   - **Distance Safety Score**: 5
   - **Time Risk Reason**: Movement is slight; opportunistic path is not intersecting with Ego.
   - **Time Safety Score**: 5
   - **Overall Risk Score**: 5

7. **Obstacle ID: 20050.0**
   - **Distance Risk Reason**: Moving in a different trajectory with no intersection with Ego.
   - **Distance Safety Score**: 5
   - **Time Risk Reason**: Fast velocity but consistent path away from Ego's lanelet.
   - **Time Safety Score**: 5
   - **Overall Risk Score**: 5

8. **Obstacle ID: 20054.0**
   - **Distance Risk Reason**: In the same lanelet as the Ego but moving ahead at a decreasing speed.
   - **Distance Safety Score**: 4
   - **Time Risk Reason**: Decreasing velocity indicates deceleration, but relative motion suggests no immediate risk.
   - **Time Safety Score**: 4
   - **Overall Risk Score**: 4

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
The scenario indicates no current collision. Most obstacles are either stationary or moving along non-intersecting paths. Although Obstacle 20054 is within the same lanelet, its deceleration and position ahead of the Ego suggest manageable risk levels with current velocities and deceleration trends.
