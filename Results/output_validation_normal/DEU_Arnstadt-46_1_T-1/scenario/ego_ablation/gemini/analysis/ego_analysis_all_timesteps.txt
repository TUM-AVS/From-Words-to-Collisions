Obstacle 20054 is in front of the ego vehicle and moving towards it longitudinally.  At the most recent timestep (0.9 seconds), the longitudinal distance is 11.15 meters with a closing velocity of -0.24 m/s. Although the obstacle is relatively close and approaching, the closing speed is low.  Additionally, the provided data shows a decreasing closing velocity over the last few timesteps, suggesting the relative velocity may soon become positive.  Given the current information, a collision is not imminent, nor is it highly likely in the very near future.  Therefore, Obstacle 20054 presents a low risk at this moment.
