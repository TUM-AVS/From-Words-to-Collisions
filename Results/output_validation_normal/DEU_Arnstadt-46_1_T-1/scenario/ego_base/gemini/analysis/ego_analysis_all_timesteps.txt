At t=0.9s, obstacle 20054 is in front of the ego vehicle, at a longitudinal distance of 11.15m and lateral distance of 0.00m.  The relative longitudinal velocity is -0.24 m/s, indicating that the obstacle is still moving towards the ego vehicle, but at a slower rate than previous timesteps. The relative longitudinal acceleration is 0.02 m/sÂ², suggesting the obstacle might be slightly accelerating away from the ego vehicle or braking less intensely. While the obstacle is still approaching, the decreasing relative velocity and positive relative acceleration suggests the risk is diminishing. Given the current distance and relative velocity, a collision is not imminent in the next timestep. However, continued monitoring is necessary.
