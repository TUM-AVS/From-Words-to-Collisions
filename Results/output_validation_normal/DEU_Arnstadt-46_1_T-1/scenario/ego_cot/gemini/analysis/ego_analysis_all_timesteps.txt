### Safety analysis for timestep 0.9s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:
- **Obstacle ID:** 20054
- **Distance Risk reason:** At 0.9 seconds, Obstacle 20054 is 11.15m longitudinally and 11.15m laterally away from the ego vehicle, and is located in front of the ego vehicle. While these distances might seem safe in isolation, the obstacle's motion and velocity suggest otherwise.  The consistent reduction in longitudinal distance over the preceding timesteps strongly indicates a closing trajectory. The lateral distance is identical to the longitudinal distance suggesting the obstacle is approaching at a near 45-degree angle, although “exact lateral alignment or unknown case” means more lateral information is needed.
- **Distance safety score:** 3 (Medium Risk)
- **Time Risk reason:** The provided data doesn't directly give TTC. However, we can estimate it. At 0.9s, the longitudinal relative velocity is -0.24 m/s, meaning the obstacle is closing in on the ego vehicle at this rate.  A simple estimation of TTC (longitudinal distance / longitudinal relative velocity) gives 11.15m / 0.24m/s ≈ 46.5 seconds. However, this estimation doesn't consider the relative acceleration which is shown as generally small and positive indicating the closing velocity might be decreasing. Although the lateral velocity is near zero [-0.00 m/s], the lateral acceleration is negative suggesting the obstacle might be moving away laterally.
- **Time safety score:** 4 (Low Risk)
- **Overall Risk score:** 3 (Medium Risk). Although the TTC appears high, the consistent closing distance throughout the scenario, combined with the fact that the obstacle is directly in front of the ego vehicle, raises concern. Further investigation and potentially evasive maneuvers are needed as this situation could quickly deteriorate with even small changes in velocity or trajectory. The lack of clear lateral motion and the description "Exact lateral alignment or unknown case" also contribute to the medium risk assessment.  It's best to proceed cautiously until the lateral movement is better understood.
