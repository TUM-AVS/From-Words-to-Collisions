### Obstacle-by-Obstacle Analysis (Most Recent Timestep: 0.9 seconds)

#### Obstacle 20054 (Front of ego car)
- **Adjusted Distances**: Longitudinal = 11.15 m, Lateral = 0.00 m  
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal = -0.24 m/s (approaching), Lateral = -0.00 m/s (stable)  
- **Relative Acceleration**: Longitudinal = 0.02 m/s² (slightly increasing speed), Lateral = -0.41 m/s² (minor lateral adjustment)  
- **Motion Description**: Obstacle is driving toward the ego car longitudinally. Exact lateral alignment.  

#### Trajectory Analysis (0.0s to 0.9s)
- The obstacle is consistently approaching the ego car longitudinally with decreasing relative velocity (from -0.74 m/s at 0.1s to -0.24 m/s at 0.9s).  
- Lateral distance remains 0.00 m (exact alignment), but there is no lateral movement or risk of side collision.  
- The longitudinal deceleration suggests the obstacle is slowing down slightly, reducing the closing speed.  

#### Time-to-Collision (TTC) Calculation
- TTC = Longitudinal Distance / |Relative Velocity| = 11.15 m / 0.24 m/s ≈ **46.46 seconds**  
  - This falls under **No Risk (5)** since TTC > 5.0 seconds.  

#### Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC) Calculation
- Since the obstacle is directly ahead (lateral = 0.00 m), MDC is effectively the longitudinal distance: **11.15 m**  
  - This falls under **No Risk (5)** since MDC > 5.0 meters.  

#### Risk Assessment
- **TTC Risk**: 5 (No Risk)  
- **MDC Risk**: 5 (No Risk)  
- **Overall Risk**: 5 (No Risk)  

### Conclusion
- No collision (risk score 0) or extreme risk (risk score 1) is detected.  
- The obstacle is far ahead (11.15 m) and closing very slowly (0.24 m/s), posing no immediate danger.
