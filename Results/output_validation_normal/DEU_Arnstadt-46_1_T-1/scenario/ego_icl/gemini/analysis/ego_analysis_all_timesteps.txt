Obstacle Analysis:

Obstacle 20054:

Trajectory Analysis:  Over the observed time steps (0.0s to 0.9s), Obstacle 20054 consistently remains in front of the ego vehicle and is laterally aligned (lateral distance = 0.00m).  The longitudinal distance decreases slightly from 12.15m to 11.15m, indicating the obstacle is approaching the ego vehicle, albeit slowly. The relative longitudinal velocity is negative and gets closer to zero across the timesteps,  meaning that although the obstacle is moving towards the ego vehicle, the closing speed is decreasing.

TTC Calculation:
At t=0.9s, longitudinal distance = 11.15m, relative longitudinal velocity = -0.24 m/s.
TTC = distance / |relative_velocity| = 11.15m / |-0.24 m/s| = 46.46s  (Since relative velocity is negative, TTC is not really applicable in a collision assessment sense).

MDC Calculation:
Given the obstacle's position directly in front of the ego vehicle and the consistently zero lateral distance, MDC is essentially the longitudinal distance of 11.15 meters.

Risk Assessment:
- Longitudinal Risk: Based on MDC (11.15m) the longitudinal risk is 5 (No Risk). Although the obstacle is slightly approaching, the closing speed is very slow.
- Lateral Risk: Due to the perfect lateral alignment (0.00m), any slight lateral movement by either vehicle could lead to a collision. This risk is 5 as there's no lateral movement yet.

Overall Risk: No Risk (5)

Collision Scenario Determination:

This is NOT a collision scenario. No obstacle has a risk score of 0 or 1.
