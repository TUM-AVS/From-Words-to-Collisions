**Obstacle-by-Obstacle Analysis for Obstacle 20054**

1. **Trajectory Analysis Across Timesteps:**

   - **Timestep 0.1 seconds to 0.9 seconds:**
     - The obstacle 20054 is moving toward the ego vehicle with decreasing longitudinal distances each timestep and consistent lateral alignment (0 m).
     - Relative velocity is negative, indicating the obstacle is approaching the ego vehicle longitudinally (decreasing distance).
     - The longitudinal relative velocity increased negatively from -0.74 m/s to -1.21 m/s at 0.5 seconds, then decreased negatively suggesting moderate deceleration as it approaches the ego vehicle.

2. **Most Recent Timestep Analysis (0.9 seconds):**

   - **Adjusted Longitudinal Distance:** Since the instructions specify using adjusted distances, let us assume adjusted longitudinal and lateral distances to be similar to the real distances listed (as they were not specified here).
   - **Longitudinal Distance:** 11.15 meters
   - **Lateral Distance:** 0.00 meters
   - **Relative Velocity:** Longitudinal -0.24 m/s
   - **MDC Calculation:** As obstacle 20054 is directly in front with longitudinal distance reducing, MDC aligns with the current distance:
     - MDC = 11.15 meters (no immediate intersection with very low or zero distance)
   - **TTC Calculation:** Calculate based on longitudinal distance and velocity:
     - TTC = 11.15 meters / |0.24 m/s| â‰ˆ 46.46 seconds

3. **Risk Assessment:**

   - **MDC:** Indicates No Risk with a value greater than 5 meters.
   - **TTC:** Indicates No Risk given that it's well over 5 seconds.
   
   - Both MDC and TTC are in a risk score category of 5 (No Risk).

4. **Conclusion and Determination of Collision Scenario:**

   The obstacle does not present a high risk of collision given the large MDC and significant TTC. There are no trajectories or acceleration trends indicating an imminent collision with the ego vehicle.
