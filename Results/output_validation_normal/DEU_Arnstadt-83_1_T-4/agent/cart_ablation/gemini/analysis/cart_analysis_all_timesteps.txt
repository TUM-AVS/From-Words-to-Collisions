Obstacle 20036.0 (in lanelet 909.0) is moving roughly parallel to the ego vehicle (in lanelet 908.0), but in a different lane. The y-coordinates are converging, but the x-coordinate difference remains relatively stable, indicating a low probability of collision.

Obstacle 20055.0 (in the same lanelet 908.0 as the ego vehicle) is moving in the same general direction but with a slightly higher velocity.  The y-coordinate difference is substantial and increasing over time. This indicates divergence and a low probability of collision.
