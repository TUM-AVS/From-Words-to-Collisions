Obstacle 20036.0 (in lanelet 909) is consistently far from the ego vehicle (in lanelet 908), posing no risk.  Obstacle 20055.0 (also in lanelet 908) is initially somewhat distant from the ego vehicle, but the distance is decreasing over time. However, even at the last timestamp (0.9 seconds), there's still a reasonable lateral and longitudinal separation. Given their current trajectories and speeds, a collision doesn't appear imminent or highly likely in the very near future. Therefore, neither obstacle presents a collision risk, extreme risk, or even a high risk in the provided timeframe.
