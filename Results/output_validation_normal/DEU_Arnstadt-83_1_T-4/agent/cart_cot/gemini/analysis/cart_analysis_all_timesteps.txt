Here's the collision risk analysis for the provided scenario at t=0.9s:

**Ego Vehicle State (t=0.9s):**
* Position: (526.9836, -195.1989)
* Orientation: 1.7534941942216098 rad
* Velocity: 11.3803 m/s
* Acceleration: -1.7741 m/s²

**Obstacle States (t=0.9s):**

* **Obstacle 20036.0:**
    * Position: (526.5209, -214.775)
    * Orientation: -1.4267 rad
    * Velocity: 12.9579 m/s
    * Acceleration: 0 m/s²
    * Lanelet: 909.0

* **Obstacle 20055.0:**
    * Position: (521.5923, -173.8702)
    * Orientation: 1.904 rad
    * Velocity: 13.3823 m/s
    * Acceleration: 0.0813 m/s²
    * Lanelet: 908.0


**Analysis:**

Focusing on the last provided timestep (t=0.9s), we analyze the risk for each obstacle:

* **Obstacle 20036.0:** This obstacle is in a different lanelet (909.0) than the ego vehicle (908.0). While the x-coordinates are close, the y-coordinates show a significant separation, indicating no immediate risk.  Examining the trajectories from earlier timesteps confirms that this obstacle is moving roughly parallel to the ego vehicle but further along the negative y-axis. The consistent velocity and zero acceleration suggest this trend will continue.  Therefore, even though they are in relatively close proximity, the difference in lanelets and the predicted future trajectories suggest a low risk of collision. Risk Score: 4 (Low Risk).

* **Obstacle 20055.0:** This obstacle is in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle (908.0). While the y-coordinates place this obstacle ahead of the ego vehicle, the x-coordinates suggest a lateral offset. Examining previous timesteps reveals that this obstacle and the ego vehicle are on converging paths. While the current positions don't indicate an immediate collision,  the obstacle is catching up to the ego car while not being directly ahead.  Therefore, there is a higher level of concern. Risk Score: 3 (Medium Risk).
