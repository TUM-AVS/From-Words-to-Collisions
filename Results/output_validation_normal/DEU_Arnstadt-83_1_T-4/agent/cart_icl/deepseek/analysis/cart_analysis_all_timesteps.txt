### Analysis:

1. **Obstacle 20036 (Lanelet 909.0)**:
   - **Position**: At 0.9s, the obstacle is at (526.5209, -214.775), moving away from the ego vehicle (526.9836, -195.1989).
   - **Relative Motion**: The obstacle is moving in the opposite direction (orientation -1.4267) and is behind the ego vehicle. The lateral distance is significant, and the longitudinal distance is increasing.
   - **TTC**: Not applicable (moving away).
   - **Risk**: **Negligible (5)**.

2. **Obstacle 20055 (Lanelet 908.0)**:
   - **Position**: At 0.9s, the obstacle is at (521.5923, -173.8702), ahead of the ego vehicle (526.9836, -195.1989).
   - **Relative Motion**: The obstacle is moving in the same direction (orientation 1.904) but is ahead of the ego vehicle. The longitudinal distance is ~21.33m, and the lateral distance is negligible (same lanelet).
   - **Velocity**: Ego is decelerating (11.3803 m/s), and the obstacle is accelerating (13.3823 m/s).
   - **TTC**: Longitudinal distance / relative velocity = 21.33 / (13.3823 - 11.3803) â‰ˆ 10.66s.
   - **Risk**: **Low (4)** due to sufficient time to react.
