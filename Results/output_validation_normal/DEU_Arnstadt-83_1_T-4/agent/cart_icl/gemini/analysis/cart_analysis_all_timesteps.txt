At t=0.9s, the ego vehicle is at (526.9836, -195.1989) with a velocity of 11.38 m/s.  Let's analyze the two obstacles:

**Obstacle 20036:** This obstacle is in a different lanelet (909 vs. ego's 908), and its lateral position remains relatively constant while its longitudinal position increases.  The Y-coordinate difference between the ego and obstacle 20036 has been steadily increasing, indicating divergence and no immediate collision risk.  While more context regarding lanelet geometry would be beneficial, based on the provided data, there is no immediate risk. Risk: **Negligible (5)**

**Obstacle 20055:**  This obstacle is in the same lanelet as the ego (908). Comparing positions at t=0.8s and t=0.9s, we see both the x and y coordinates are decreasing for both ego and the obstacle. The lateral distance appears minimal, and the longitudinal distance is decreasing. We need to estimate TTC.  The x-coordinate shows an approximate separation of roughly 4 meters. The difference of the x-component of velocity is 11.38 (ego)-cos(1.904)*13.38 = 11.38-(-3.65) = 15.03 m/s. The x-component of the velocity shows how fast they are approaching each other in x coordinate. The difference shows an alarmingly low TTC if we consider only the x-component of velocity. Risk: **High (2)**
