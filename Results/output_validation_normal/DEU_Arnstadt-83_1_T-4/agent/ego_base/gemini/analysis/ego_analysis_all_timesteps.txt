At t=0.9s:
- Obstacle 20036: Located rear-left (-14.66m longitudinal, 2.40m lateral) and moving away from the ego vehicle both longitudinally (-24.33 m/s) and laterally (0.50 m/s).  This obstacle poses a negligible risk.

- Obstacle 20055: Located in front (17.45m longitudinal, 0.00m lateral) and moving away longitudinally (1.85 m/s).  Lateral relative velocity is 2.01 m/s, but given the exact lateral alignment and the fact that it is moving away longitudinally, this likely represents a lane change maneuver by 20055 and does not represent a high risk. This obstacle poses a low risk.
