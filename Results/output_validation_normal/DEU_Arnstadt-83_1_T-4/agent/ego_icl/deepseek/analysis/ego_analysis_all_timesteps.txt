### Obstacle-by-Obstacle Analysis

#### Obstacle 20036 (Rear-left of ego car)
- **Most Recent Timestep (0.9s):**
  - **Adjusted Distances:** Longitudinal -14.66 m, Lateral 2.40 m
  - **Relative Velocity:** Longitudinal -24.33 m/s (moving away), Lateral 0.50 m/s (moving away)
  - **Motion Description:** Obstacle is moving away longitudinally and laterally to the left.
  - **Trajectory Analysis:**
    - The obstacle was initially at longitudinal 0.00 m and lateral 1.89 m at 0.1s.
    - Over time, the longitudinal distance increases negatively (moving behind the ego car), and the lateral distance increases (moving away to the left).
    - The relative velocities confirm the obstacle is moving away in both dimensions.
  - **TTC Calculation:**
    - Longitudinal: Not applicable (moving away, relative velocity is negative).
    - Lateral: Not applicable (moving away, relative velocity is positive).
  - **MDC Calculation:**
    - The obstacle is moving away in both dimensions, so MDC is increasing.
    - Current lateral distance (2.40 m) is the closest dimension, but it is increasing.
  - **Risk Assessment:**
    - No risk of collision as the obstacle is moving away in both dimensions.
    - **Overall Risk Score: 5 (Negligible Risk)**

#### Obstacle 20055 (Front of ego car)
- **Most Recent Timestep (0.9s):**
  - **Adjusted Distances:** Longitudinal 17.45 m, Lateral 0.00 m
  - **Relative Velocity:** Longitudinal 1.85 m/s (moving away), Lateral 2.01 m/s (moving away)
  - **Motion Description:** Obstacle is moving away longitudinally. Exact lateral alignment or unknown case.
  - **Trajectory Analysis:**
    - The obstacle was initially at longitudinal 16.54 m and lateral 0.00 m at 0.1s.
    - Over time, the longitudinal distance increases (moving away from the ego car), and the lateral distance remains 0.00 m (exact alignment).
    - The relative velocities confirm the obstacle is moving away in both dimensions.
  - **TTC Calculation:**
    - Longitudinal: Not applicable (moving away, relative velocity is positive).
    - Lateral: Not applicable (moving away, relative velocity is positive).
  - **MDC Calculation:**
    - The obstacle is moving away in both dimensions, so MDC is increasing.
    - Current longitudinal distance (17.45 m) is the closest dimension, but it is increasing.
  - **Risk Assessment:**
    - No risk of collision as the obstacle is moving away in both dimensions.
    - **Overall Risk Score: 5 (Negligible Risk)**

### JSON Summary

```json
{
    "CollisionObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": null,
        "OverallRiskScore": null
    },
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": null,
        "OverallRiskScore": null
    },
    "HighRiskObstacle": {
        "ObstacleID": null,
        "OverallRiskScore": null
    }
}
```

### Explanation:
- Neither obstacle poses any collision or extreme/high risk. Both are moving away from the ego car in both longitudinal and lateral dimensions, resulting in negligible risk (score 5) for both. The JSON summary reflects no collision or high-risk obstacles.
