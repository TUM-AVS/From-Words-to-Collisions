### Analysis of the Most Recent Timestep (0.9 seconds)

#### Obstacle 20036 (Rear-left)
- **Trajectory Analysis**: 
  - This obstacle has been consistently moving away longitudinally and laterally from the ego car since it transitioned to the rear-left position from being directly left.
  - The adjusted longitudinal distance has increased each timestep from negative values, indicating the obstacle is falling further behind.

- **Adjusted Distances**: 
  - Longitudinal: -14.66 meters, indicating it is well behind the ego vehicle.
  - Lateral: 2.40 meters, indicating it is not directly aligned on the side of the ego vehicle.

- **Relative Velocity**: 
  - Longitudinal: -24.33 m/s (moving away).
  - Lateral: Positive lateral relative velocity suggests some movement away laterally.

- **TTC Calculation**: 
  - Longitudinal TTC and Lateral TTC are not applicable as paths are diverging (moving away).

- **MDC Calculation**: 
  - The obstacle is moving away both longitudinally and laterally. Thus, MDC > 5.0 meters can be inferred as no chance of collision trajectory.
  
- **Risk Assessment**:
  - With diverging paths, the risk score is "5" (Negligible Risk).

#### Obstacle 20055 (Front)
- **Trajectory Analysis**: 
  - The obstacle has been consistently moving away longitudinally with increasing distances from ~16.54 meters to 17.45 meters.
  - The obstacle remains in exact lateral alignment but is moving away longitudinally.

- **Adjusted Distances**: 
  - Longitudinal: 17.45 meters, well ahead.
  - Lateral: 0.00 meters, indicating in-lane alignment.

- **Relative Velocity**:
  - Longitudinal: 1.85 m/s (moving away).
  - Noteworthy lateral relative velocity does not impact risk due to front focus.

- **TTC Calculation**:
  - Longitudinal TTC is not applicable as it is moving away.

- **MDC Calculation**:
  - Given the increasing longitudinal distance and lack of converging trajectory, MDC is effectively >5.0 meters.

- **Risk Assessment**:
  - With diverging longitudinal paths and no aggressive closing, the risk score is "5" (Negligible Risk).

### Conclusion
Neither obstacle is at risk of collision or extreme risk. Obstacle 20036 is moving away from both dimensions, and Obstacle 20055 is moving away longitudinally with risk assessment beyond thresholds for concern at this timestep.
