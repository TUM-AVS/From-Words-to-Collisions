At t=0.9s, Ego is in lanelet 908.0 at (526.9836, -195.1989) with a velocity of 11.38 m/s.

Obstacle 20036.0 is in lanelet 909.0 at (526.5209, -214.775) with a velocity of 12.96 m/s.  While the x-coordinates are close, the y-coordinate difference is significant, and they are in different lanelets.  This suggests a low risk of collision.

Obstacle 20055.0 is in the same lanelet as Ego (908.0), located at (521.5923, -173.8702) with a velocity of 13.38 m/s. Obstacle 20055.0 is behind Ego and moving faster.  Given the trajectories observed over the preceding timesteps, 20055.0 is closing in on Ego, posing a potential risk if the current trend continues. However, at this moment the distance is still sufficient to rate this as a lower risk level (not extreme).
