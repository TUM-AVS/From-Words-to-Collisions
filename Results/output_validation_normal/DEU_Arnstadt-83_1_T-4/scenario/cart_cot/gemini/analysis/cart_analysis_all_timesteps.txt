### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 20036.0
- Distance Risk reason: This obstacle is in a different lanelet (909.0) than the ego vehicle (908.0).  While the Y-coordinates suggest some proximity, the different lanelets and the consistent trajectory of this obstacle over the past 0.9 seconds indicate no immediate risk.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: The obstacle's velocity and zero acceleration are relatively constant and do not pose a direct threat given its lane position.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 20055.0
- Distance Risk reason: This obstacle is in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle.  While there is currently a longitudinal separation, the y-coordinates show that the vehicles are getting closer together. Over the observed timeframe, this obstacle has consistently been ahead of the ego vehicle in the same lanelet. The distance is closing, as evidenced by decreasing y-coordinate differences.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason:  The obstacle's velocity is slightly higher than the ego vehicle's and the acceleration is minimal, indicating it is continuing to pull slightly ahead. The ego vehicle has decelerated over the observed timeframe.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4



### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. **Most critical obstacle:** Obstacle 20055.0 poses the most significant risk as it's in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle and the distance between them is decreasing. Obstacle 20036.0 is in a different lanelet and poses no immediate threat.

2. **Trajectory Analysis (Over all 10 timesteps):** Obstacle 20055.0 consistently maintains a position ahead of the ego vehicle within the same lanelet.  The ego vehicle is decelerating while 20055 maintains a steady velocity, further separating them longitudinally.  Obstacle 20036.0 remains in its lane with a constant velocity and does not appear to interact with the ego vehicle's path.

3. **Relative Positions, Velocities, and Accelerations:** At the latest timestep, Obstacle 20055.0 is ahead of the ego vehicle and has a slightly faster velocity. The ego vehicle's velocity is lower and there is an observed deceleration trend.

4. **Collision Determination:** No collision has occurred, and based on the observed data, an imminent collision is not detected between either obstacle and the ego vehicle. Obstacle 20055 does need to be monitored to assess whether the ego vehicle continues to decelerate at a significant rate.

5. **Reasoning:** Although Obstacle 20055.0 is in the same lane and ahead of the ego vehicle, the consistent separation and the lack of any sharp changes in velocity or acceleration indicate that a collision is not imminent within the observed timeframe.  The relative velocities of the ego vehicle and 20055 suggest that a collision is unlikely. The other obstacle (20036.0) remains in a different lane and poses no risk.


### Summary in JSON Format: 
```json
{
    "CollisionObstacles": null,
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null,
    "ScenarioAnalysis": {
        "IsCollisionScenario": false,
        "Reasoning": "No collision is detected or imminent within the analyzed timeframe. Obstacle 20055.0 poses the most significant risk due to its presence in the same lane, but the consistent separation, coupled with the ego vehicle's deceleration and 20055.0's slight acceleration, decrease the likelihood of a collision in the immediate future. Obstacle 20036.0 remains in a different lane and is not considered a threat."
