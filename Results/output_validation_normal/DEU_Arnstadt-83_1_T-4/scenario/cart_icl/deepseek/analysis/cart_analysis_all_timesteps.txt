### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep:

### Obstacle Analysis:
- **Obstacle ID: 20036.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is in lanelet 909.0, which is adjacent to the ego's lanelet (908.0). Over the past timesteps, it has been moving away from the ego vehicle in the Y-direction (increasing Y-coordinate difference). The current distance is ~19.6m (calculated as sqrt((526.5209-526.9836)^2 + (-214.775 - (-195.1989))^2)).
  - **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: The obstacle is moving away from the ego vehicle (relative velocity in Y-direction is positive). No risk of collision.
  - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 20055.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is in the same lanelet (908.0) as the ego vehicle. Over the past timesteps, it has been moving in the same direction as the ego but with a higher velocity (13.3823 vs 11.3803). The current distance is ~21.3m (sqrt((521.5923-526.9836)^2 + (-173.8702 - (-195.1989))^2)).
  - **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: The obstacle is moving away from the ego vehicle (relative velocity is positive in the Y-direction). The TTC is large (distance/relative velocity ~21.3/(13.3823-11.3803) â‰ˆ 10.6s).
  - **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 4 (Low Risk)

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. **Obstacle 20036.0**: In adjacent lanelet, moving away from ego. No collision risk.
2. **Obstacle 20055.0**: In same lanelet, moving away from ego with increasing distance. Low risk due to sufficient TTC and distance.
3. No obstacles are on a collision course with the ego vehicle.
4. The ego vehicle is decelerating, reducing its speed, which further mitigates risk.
