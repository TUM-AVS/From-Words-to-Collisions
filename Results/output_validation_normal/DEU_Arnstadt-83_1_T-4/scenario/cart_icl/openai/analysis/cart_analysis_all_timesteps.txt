### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 20035**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is moving away from the ego vehicle with a consistent trajectory and velocity in a different lanelet.
  - **Distance safety score**: 4
  - **Time Risk reason**: The relative velocity and acceleration trends do not suggest an imminent collision.
  - **Time safety score**: 4
  - **Overall Risk score**: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 20036**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Moving in a lanelet slightly ahead of the ego vehicle but at a safe distance. Consistent speed and acceleration.
  - **Distance safety score**: 3
  - **Time Risk reason**: Steady motion without sudden changes indicates low risk.
  - **Time safety score**: 4
  - **Overall Risk score**: 3.5

- **Obstacle ID: 20055**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: Positioned close to the ego vehicle with parallel movement and similar velocity trends.
  - **Distance safety score**: 3
  - **Time Risk reason**: Slight negative acceleration and steady velocity indicate controlled spacing.
  - **Time safety score**: 3
  - **Overall Risk score**: 3

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
The scenario depicts several obstacles moving mostly parallel to or away from the ego vehicle with consistent velocities and orientations over the observed time steps. While certain obstacles are near the ego's trajectory, none show drastic traction towards the ego vehicle in terms of velocity direction or acceleration, thus minimizing immediate collision risks. There is no critical reduction in distance between the ego vehicle and any obstacle that would signal an impending collision.
