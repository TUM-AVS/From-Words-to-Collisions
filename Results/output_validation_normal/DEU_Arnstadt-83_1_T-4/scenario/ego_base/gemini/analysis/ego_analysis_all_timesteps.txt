At t=0.9s, Obstacle 20036 is in the Rear-left, moving away longitudinally (-24.33 m/s) and laterally (0.50 m/s) from the ego vehicle. It poses no immediate risk. Obstacle 20055 is in the Front, moving away longitudinally (1.85 m/s) and laterally (2.01 m/s). While moving away longitudinally, its lateral movement might require attention in the future but doesn't present an immediate collision risk.  Neither obstacle poses an immediate collision risk in the most recent timestep.

**Risk Levels and Definitions:**
<Collision (Score: 0)>: Actual collision has occurred or is unavoidable within the next timestep.
<Extreme Risk (Score: 1)>: Immediate collision or very high likelihood of impact. Urgent action is required.
<High Risk (Score: 2)>: Close to collision or highly probable collision path. Needs prompt attention and quick manoeuvring.
<Medium Risk (Score: 3)>: Moderate collision risk but manageable with timely reactions and proper strategies.
<Low Risk (Score: 4)>: Minimal collision risk. The situation is controllable with sufficient time to react.
<Negligible Risk (Score: 5)>: No significant collision risk. Obstacles are either moving away or far enough not to interfere.
