### Obstacle-by-Obstacle Analysis

#### Obstacle 20036 (Rear-left of ego car at 0.9s)
- **Adjusted Distance**: Longitudinal -14.66 m, Lateral 2.40 m  
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal -24.33 m/s (moving away), Lateral 0.50 m/s (moving away)  
- **Motion Description**: Obstacle is moving away both longitudinally and laterally to the left.  
- **Trajectory Analysis**:  
  - Longitudinal distance increases from -2.31m to -14.66m over 0.5s (moving away rapidly).  
  - Lateral distance increases slightly from 1.89m to 2.40m (moving away slowly).  
- **TTC Calculation**:  
  - Longitudinal: Not applicable (moving away).  
  - Lateral: 2.40 / 0.50 = 4.8s (Low Risk).  
- **MDC Calculation**:  
  - Current lateral distance is 2.40m (Medium Risk).  
  - No convergence in trajectories (distance increasing).  
- **Overall Risk**: 4 (Low Risk).  

#### Obstacle 20055 (Front of ego car at 0.9s)
- **Adjusted Distance**: Longitudinal 17.45 m, Lateral 0.00 m  
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal 1.85 m/s (moving away), Lateral 2.01 m/s (moving away).  
- **Motion Description**: Obstacle is moving away longitudinally and laterally. Exact lateral alignment.  
- **Trajectory Analysis**:  
  - Longitudinal distance increases from 16.54m to 17.45m (moving away).  
  - Lateral distance remains 0.00m but lateral velocity is positive (moving away).  
- **TTC Calculation**:  
  - Longitudinal: Not applicable (moving away).  
  - Lateral: Not applicable (moving away).  
- **MDC Calculation**:  
  - Current lateral distance is 0.00m, but obstacle is moving away (No Risk).  
- **Overall Risk**: 5 (No Risk).  

### Collision Scenario Determination
- **Obstacle 20036**: Low Risk (4).  
- **Obstacle 20055**: No Risk (5).  
- **No obstacles** have a risk score of 0 (Collision) or 1 (Extreme Risk).
