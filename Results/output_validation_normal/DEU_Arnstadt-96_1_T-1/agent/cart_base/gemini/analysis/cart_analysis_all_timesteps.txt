The ego vehicle and obstacle 20063.0 are in the same lanelet (1455.0) and the obstacle is behind the ego vehicle.  The obstacle is approaching the ego vehicle, as seen by the decreasing y-coordinate difference between them. Although the distance is significant at the beginning, the closing velocity suggests a possible high risk if the ego vehicle continues decelerating while the obstacle accelerates. 

At t=0.8s, a new obstacle (20042.0) appears in a different lanelet (1456.0).  More information about the road geometry and lanelet relationship is needed to assess the risk posed by this obstacle.  It's currently far from the ego vehicle and not an immediate concern based on the provided data.

By t=0.9s, Obstacle 20063.0 continues closing in on the ego vehicle. The risk level is increasing and requires close monitoring.  Without more information about the dimensions of the vehicles and the lanelet, it is difficult to classify it strictly as "Extreme Risk" yet, but it's certainly approaching that level.
