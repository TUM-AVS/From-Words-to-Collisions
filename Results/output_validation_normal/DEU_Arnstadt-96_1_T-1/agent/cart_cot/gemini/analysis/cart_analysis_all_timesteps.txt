Here's the collision risk analysis for the provided scenario:

**Analysis at t=0.9s:**

* **Ego Vehicle (20065.0):**
    * Position: (24.4359, 207.865)
    * Velocity: 7.1703 
    * Acceleration: -0.0955
* **Obstacle 1 (20042.0):**
    * Position: (40.1375, 184.8019)
    * Velocity: 14.6335
    * Acceleration: 0.0884
* **Obstacle 2 (20063.0):**
    * Position: (37.0443, 182.5729)
    * Velocity: 11.7065
    * Acceleration: 0.7035

**Calculations and Reasoning:**

1. **Distance Calculation:**  At t=0.9s, the distances between Ego and the obstacles are:
    * Ego - Obstacle 1: sqrt((40.1375 - 24.4359)^2 + (184.8019 - 207.865)^2) ≈ 28.74
    * Ego - Obstacle 2: sqrt((37.0443 - 24.4359)^2 + (182.5729 - 207.865)^2) ≈ 27.88

2. **TTC (Time to Collision):**  A precise TTC calculation requires more information about the vehicles' headings and future trajectories. However, we can make approximations based on current velocities and positions.  Obstacle 2 poses a higher risk due to its proximity and the fact that both it and the ego vehicle are in the same lanelet (1455) unlike obstacle 1 that switched to a different lanelet (1456), making a collision more likely.  Obstacle 1 poses a lower risk as it appears to be moving away from the ego vehicle and is in a different lanelet.

3. **MDC (Minimum Distance to Collision):**  The MDC at t=0.9s are approximately 28.74 (Obstacle 1) and 27.88 (Obstacle 2).  This indicates Obstacle 2 is currently closer to the ego vehicle.

4. **Predicted Collision:** Based on proximity and being in the same lane, there is a medium risk with Obstacle 2. Obstacle 1 poses a very minimal risk given the current trajectory.  Even though it is further away than obstacle 2, its high speed could become dangerous if its trajectory changes in the future. Therefore, we rate it as low risk.
