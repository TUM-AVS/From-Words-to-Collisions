### Analysis:

1. **Obstacle 20063.0**:
   - **Position**: At 0.9s, the obstacle is at (37.0443, 182.5729), while the ego is at (24.4359, 207.865).
   - **Relative Motion**: The obstacle is moving in the same lanelet (1455.0) as the ego but is ahead and to the left. The lateral distance is significant (~25.3m), and the longitudinal distance is ~12.6m.
   - **Velocity**: The obstacle is moving faster (11.7065 m/s) than the ego (7.1703 m/s), so the distance is increasing.
   - **TTC**: Not applicable (distance increasing).
   - **Risk**: **Negligible (5)** - No immediate risk due to increasing distance and significant lateral separation.

2. **Obstacle 20042.0**:
   - **Position**: At 0.9s, the obstacle is at (40.1375, 184.8019), while the ego is at (24.4359, 207.865).
   - **Relative Motion**: The obstacle is in a different lanelet (1456.0) and is ahead and to the left of the ego. The lateral distance is ~23.1m, and the longitudinal distance is ~15.7m.
   - **Velocity**: The obstacle is moving much faster (14.6335 m/s) than the ego (7.1703 m/s), so the distance is increasing.
   - **TTC**: Not applicable (distance increasing).
   - **Risk**: **Negligible (5)** - No immediate risk due to increasing distance and significant lateral separation.

### Summary:
- No obstacles pose an immediate collision or extreme risk.
- Both obstacles are moving away from the ego vehicle with significant lateral separation.
