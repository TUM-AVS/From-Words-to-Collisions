At t=0.9s, the ego vehicle at (24.4359, 207.865) is moving with a velocity of 7.1703 and decelerating at -0.0955.  We'll analyze the two obstacles present:

**Obstacle 20063:** Located at (37.0443, 182.5729), this obstacle is significantly behind and to the right of the ego vehicle. It's moving with a velocity of 11.7065 and accelerating slightly at 0.7035. Given the substantial lateral and longitudinal separation, and the diverging paths, this obstacle presents no immediate risk.

**Obstacle 20042:**  Located at (40.1375, 184.8019), this obstacle is also behind the ego vehicle but further to the right and slightly ahead of Obstacle 20063. It has a higher velocity of 14.6335 and a negligible acceleration of 0.0884.  Similar to Obstacle 20063, the significant lateral separation and diverging trajectories indicate no immediate risk.

Analyzing the previous timesteps reveals that both obstacles have consistently remained laterally separated from the ego vehicle. While they have higher longitudinal velocities, their trajectories do not intersect with the ego vehicle's path in the foreseeable future.

Therefore, no obstacles pose an immediate collision risk.
