In analyzing the scenario, several key aspects were assessed, focusing on the latest timestep (0.9 seconds) to determine potential collision risks associated with the ego vehicle's interaction with obstacles:

### Ego Vehicle Movement Analysis
- **Position**: The ego vehicle has moved from (20.0495, 213.6003) at 0.0 seconds to (24.4359, 207.865) at 0.9 seconds, illustrating a south-easterly trajectory.
- **Orientation**: The orientation of the ego vehicle has slightly adjusted, indicating a continual turn in its trajectory.
- **Velocity and Acceleration**: The velocity decreased from 9.3698 m/s at 0.0 seconds to 7.1703 m/s at 0.9 seconds, with relatively minor acceleration adjustments, showing a gradual deceleration.

### Obstacle Analysis at 0.9 seconds:

1. **Obstacle 20042.0**:
   - **Position**: (40.1375, 184.8019) in lanelet 1456.0. It is in a different lanelet than the ego vehicle (1455.0).
   - **Velocity and Orientation**: Maintains a high velocity of 14.6335 m/s with a consistent orientation, showing movement away from the ego vehicle's path.
   - **Lateral Distance**: Sufficient lateral gap from the ego, suggesting no immediate collision threat.

2. **Obstacle 20063.0**:
   - **Position**: (37.0443, 182.5729) in lanelet 1455.0, the same as the ego. It is significantly closer to the ego vehicle in terms of proximity.
   - **Relative Longitudinal Position**: Approximately 15 meters ahead of the ego vehicle.
   - **Relative Longitudinal Velocity**: Similar orientation and velocity compared to the ego vehicle suggest a diminishing distance.
   - **TTC Calculation**: As the obstacle is ahead, assessing reverse TTC:
     - If ego's velocity and obstacle's velocity are similarly directed, relative velocity indicates gradual distancing.
     - No direct TTC concerns due to consistent parallel trajectories, but proximity requires monitoring.
   - **MDC (Minimum Distance to Collision)**: Presumably around 15 meters, a safe distance for current conditions, but vigilance required.

### Conclusion:
The main concern lies with obstacle 20063.0 due to shared lanelet and proximity. While the assessment indicates manageable levels of risk, monitoring and potential adjustments in velocity and position by the ego vehicle may be necessary to avert risks stemming from dynamic traffic situations.
