At the most recent timestep (0.9 seconds), Obstacle 20042 is rapidly approaching the ego vehicle longitudinally at -21.03 m/s while Obstacle 20063 is moving away from the ego vehicle both longitudinally (3.58 m/s) and laterally (-4.63 m/s).

Obstacle 20042 poses a significant risk due to its high closing velocity. While it appears to have a lateral offset based on it being directly in front of the ego vehicle, the fast closing speed necessitates immediate action to avoid a potential collision. Obstacle 20063, on the other hand, presents no immediate risk as it is moving away from the ego vehicle in both directions.
