### Safety analysis for timestep 0.9s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

**- Obstacle ID: 20042**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 20042 is located in front of the ego vehicle with a longitudinal distance of 23.39m and a lateral distance of 23.39m. While the lateral distance suggests no immediate risk, the longitudinal distance is decreasing rapidly as indicated by the negative relative velocity (-21.03 m/s).  This indicates the obstacle is approaching the ego vehicle at a high speed.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: The high negative longitudinal velocity (-21.03 m/s) and the relatively short distance (23.39m) raise serious concerns about a potential collision.  TTClong would be approximately 23.39m / 21.03m/s â‰ˆ 1.1 seconds.  While not imminent, this is a very short time to react. Lateral motion with a positive velocity of 4.70 m/s indicates that Obstacle 20042 is slightly moving to the left. There is a risk here as well.
- Time safety score: 2
- Overall Risk score: 2

**- Obstacle ID: 20063**
- Distance Risk reason: Located at the front-right, both longitudinal and lateral distances are 23.55m. This substantial distance suggests a low immediate risk. The obstacle is moving away laterally to the right, further reducing the risk of a collision.  The slightly positive longitudinal relative velocity (3.58 m/s) suggests it is moving away from the ego vehicle longitudinally.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: The positive relative velocities both longitudinally and laterally and increasing distance mean the TTC in both directions is high. This suggests ample time for the ego vehicle to react and avoid collision.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4
