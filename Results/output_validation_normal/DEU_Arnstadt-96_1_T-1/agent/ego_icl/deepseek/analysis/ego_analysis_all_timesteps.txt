### Obstacle-by-Obstacle Analysis

#### Obstacle 20042 (Front of ego car)
- **Adjusted Distance**: Longitudinal 23.39 m, Lateral 0.00 m
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal -21.03 m/s (approaching), Lateral 4.70 m/s (moving away)
- **Motion Description**: Obstacle is driving toward the ego car longitudinally. Exact lateral alignment.
  
**Trajectory Analysis**:
- The obstacle is directly in front of the ego car (lateral distance = 0.00 m) and is approaching rapidly (longitudinal relative velocity = -21.03 m/s).
- The longitudinal distance is decreasing over time (from 25.48 m at 0.8s to 23.39 m at 0.9s).
- The lateral distance remains 0.00 m, indicating exact alignment in the same lane.

**Time-to-Collision (TTC)**:
- TTC (longitudinal) = 23.39 m / 21.03 m/s ≈ 1.11 seconds
- TTC (lateral) = Not applicable (moving away)
- **TTC Risk**: Medium (1.11 seconds falls in the 1.0 < TTC ≤ 3.0 seconds range)

**Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC)**:
- MDC is primarily the longitudinal distance since the obstacle is directly in front.
- MDC = 23.39 m (far above 5.0 m)
- **MDC Risk**: Negligible (MDC > 5.0 m)

**Overall Risk**:
- The obstacle is approaching rapidly but is still at a safe distance longitudinally. The primary risk is due to TTC (Medium Risk). No collision or extreme risk.

#### Obstacle 20063 (Front-right of ego car)
- **Adjusted Distance**: Longitudinal 23.55 m, Lateral -1.80 m
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal 3.58 m/s (moving away), Lateral -4.63 m/s (moving away)
- **Motion Description**: Obstacle is moving away longitudinally and laterally to the right.

**Trajectory Analysis**:
- The obstacle is moving away from the ego car in both longitudinal and lateral directions.
- The longitudinal distance is increasing (from 22.30 m at 0.6s to 23.55 m at 0.9s).
- The lateral distance is also increasing (from -2.02 m at 0.6s to -1.80 m at 0.9s).

**Time-to-Collision (TTC)**:
- TTC (longitudinal) = Not applicable (moving away)
- TTC (lateral) = Not applicable (moving away)
- **TTC Risk**: Negligible (no convergence)

**Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC)**:
- MDC is the smallest of the longitudinal and lateral distances, both of which are increasing.
- MDC = min(23.55 m, 1.80 m) = 1.80 m
- **MDC Risk**: Medium (1.0 < MDC ≤ 3.0 m)

**Overall Risk**:
- The obstacle is moving away in both dimensions, posing no immediate risk. The MDC is at a Medium Risk level due to the lateral distance, but the trend shows increasing distance.

### Final Notes:
- **Obstacle 20042**: Medium Risk due to TTC (1.11 seconds), but no collision or extreme risk.
- **Obstacle 20063**: Medium Risk due to MDC (1.80 m), but moving away. No immediate risk.
- No obstacles pose a collision, extreme, or high risk at the most recent timestep.
