At t=0.9s, Ego is at (24.4359, 207.865) in lanelet 1455.

Obstacle 20042 is at (40.1375, 184.8019) in lanelet 1456.  While somewhat close, this obstacle is in a different lanelet, suggesting a lower risk as lanelet changes aren't indicated.

Obstacle 20063 is at (37.0443, 182.5729) in the same lanelet 1455.  Observing the trajectories, both Ego and Obstacle 20063 have been consistently in the same lanelet. The y-coordinates (longitudinal positions, presumably) indicate that Obstacle 20063 is significantly behind Ego and moving faster (11.7 vs 7.17 m/s). While the x-coordinates (lateral positions) are converging, the velocity difference suggests that a collision is not imminent in the very next timestep, though the risk is clearly high and requires monitoring. Therefore, no obstacle presents an extreme or collision risk at this specific moment.

    "IsCollisionScenario": false,
    "Reasoning": "No obstacle presents an immediate collision risk at t=0.9s. Obstacle 20063 in the same lanelet is approaching Ego from behind at a higher speed, presenting a high risk requiring further monitoring, but not an immediate collision risk."
