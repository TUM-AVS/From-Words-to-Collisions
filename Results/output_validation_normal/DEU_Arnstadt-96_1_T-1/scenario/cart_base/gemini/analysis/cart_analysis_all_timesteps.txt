At t=0.9s, Ego is at (24.4359, 207.865) in lanelet 1455. Obstacle 20063 is at (37.0443, 182.5729) also in lanelet 1455. Obstacle 20042 is at (40.1375, 184.8019) in lanelet 1456.

Obstacle 20063 is moving faster than Ego and closing the distance in the y-coordinate, but the x-coordinate difference suggests they are likely in different parts of the same lanelet (e.g., one might be slightly further left or right within the lane). While the y-coordinate difference is decreasing, there is no immediate indication of a collision or extreme risk in the next immediate timestep.  Obstacle 20042 is in a different lanelet, therefore posing no immediate risk.

    "IsCollisionScenario": false,
    "Reasoning": "No obstacles pose an immediate collision or extreme risk at t=0.9s. While Obstacle 20063 is closing the distance along the y-axis, it doesn't pose an immediate extreme risk based on current trajectories and x-coordinate separation within the shared lanelet. Obstacle 20042 is in a different lanelet."
