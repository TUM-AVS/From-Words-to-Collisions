### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep:

### Obstacle Analysis:
- **Obstacle ID: 20063.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is in the same lanelet (1455.0) as the ego vehicle. Over the past timesteps, the distance between ego and obstacle has been decreasing (from ~22m to ~14m). The obstacle is ahead of the ego vehicle but moving away at a faster speed.
  - **Distance safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: The relative velocity (obstacle speed - ego speed) is ~4.5 m/s (11.7065 - 7.1703). The TTC is ~14m / 4.5 m/s ≈ 3.1s. The obstacle is accelerating away (0.7035 m/s² vs ego decelerating at -0.0955 m/s²).
  - **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 3 (Medium Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 20042.0**
  - **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is in a different lanelet (1456.0) and is moving in the opposite direction (orientation ~1.8276 vs ego ~-0.9873). The lateral distance is significant (~17m) and increasing.
  - **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - **Time Risk reason**: The obstacle is moving away at a high speed (14.6335 m/s) with minimal acceleration (0.0884 m/s²). No convergence in trajectories.
  - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
  - **Overall Risk score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. **Obstacle 20063.0**: Same lanelet but moving away faster than ego. Decreasing distance but TTC is >3s. Medium risk due to proximity but low collision likelihood.
2. **Obstacle 20042.0**: Different lanelet, opposite direction, no trajectory overlap. Negligible risk.
3. No obstacles are on an immediate collision course or extreme risk path.
