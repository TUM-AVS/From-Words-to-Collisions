### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
No obstacles are on a direct collision course with the ego vehicle in the analyzed timesteps. Some obstacles share the same lanelet and require monitoring, particularly 20054, 20059, and 20062, which are moderately close and could pose a risk in future timesteps if their behavior changes or if the ego vehicle maneuvers into their path.

### Summary in JSON Format: 
```json
{
  "CollisionObstacles": [],
  "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null,
  "ScenarioAnalysis": {
    "IsCollisionScenario": false,
    "Reasoning": "No obstacles are predicted to collide with the ego vehicle within the analyzed timeframe.  Obstacles 20054, 20059, and 20062 share the ego vehicle's lanelet and warrant further observation, but do not present an immediate collision risk."
