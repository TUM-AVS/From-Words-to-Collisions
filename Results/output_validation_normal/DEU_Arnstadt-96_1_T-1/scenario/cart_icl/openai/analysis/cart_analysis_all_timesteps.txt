### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep

#### Obstacle Analysis:

**Obstacle ID: 20003.0**
- **Distance Risk reason**: Obstacle is static with no velocity, located far from the ego vehicle. Over time, there has been no movement or change in relative position that threatens collision.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: Static obstacle with long-term stability in position. No threat of collision due to lack of velocity.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

**Obstacle ID: 20007.0**
- **Distance Risk reason**: Consistently static and far from the ego vehicle, with no positional changes indicating a collision course.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: No velocity across timesteps, indicating no collision potential.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

**Obstacle ID: 20013.0**
- **Distance Risk reason**: No movement recorded; remains distant in lateral position, presenting no collision risk.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: Static obstacle; poses no collision risk based on velocity data.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

**Obstacle ID: 20017.0**
- **Distance Risk reason**: Stationary position confirmed over multiple timesteps; far from the ego vehicle.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: No acceleration or velocity changes; deemed non-threatening.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

**Obstacle ID: 20019.0**
- **Distance Risk reason**: Static; no trajectory indication of movement towards the ego vehicle.
- **Distance safety score**: 5
- **Time Risk reason**: Velocity remains at zero, not a collision risk.
- **Time safety score**: 5
- **Overall Risk score**: 5

**Obstacle ID: 20042.0**
- **Distance Risk reason**: High velocity and approaching, but trajectory indicates movement along a different path that does not intersect with the ego vehicle's path.
- **Distance safety score**: 3
- **Time Risk reason**: Potential closing gap due to velocity, but trajectory remains separate from the ego vehicle.
- **Time safety score**: 3
- **Overall Risk score**: 3

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
The majority of obstacles are static and present no significant risk of collision to the ego vehicle. Only moving obstacle 20042.0 shows mild potential for interaction due to its closing distance, but its lane remains different. The scenario does not indicate immediate collision threats.

### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
    "CollisionObstacles": null,
    "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null,
    "ScenarioAnalysis": {
        "IsCollisionScenario": false,
        "Reasoning": "Obstacles are generally static or far from the ego vehicle, with no crossing paths or immediate risk identified."
    }
}
```

### Explanation:
- **CollisionObstacles**: All obstacles are either stationary or their current trajectory is non-conflicting with the ego vehicleâ€™s path.
- **ExtremeRiskObstacle**: No significant patterns of acceleration or positional changes that introduce immediate collision risk.
- **Scenario Analysis**: The ego vehicle and obstacles show no intersecting paths that present a threat under defined conditions.
