Obstacle 20042 is approaching the ego longitudinally at a high relative speed (-21.03 m/s) and is only 23.39m away. Although it's currently at the same lateral position, the lateral velocity (4.70 m/s) indicates it could pose a risk in the near future. This warrants close monitoring. Obstacle 20063 is moving away from the ego both longitudinally and laterally, posing no immediate threat.
