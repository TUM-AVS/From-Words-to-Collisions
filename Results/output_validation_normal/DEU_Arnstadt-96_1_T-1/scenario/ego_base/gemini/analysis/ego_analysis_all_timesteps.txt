Obstacle 20042 is rapidly approaching the ego vehicle longitudinally, with a relative longitudinal velocity of -21.03 m/s and a decreasing distance of 23.39 meters. While it is currently at the front and might appear aligned laterally, its lateral velocity of 4.70 m/s suggests a potential lateral movement that could lead to a collision in the near future.  Obstacle 20063 is moving away from the ego vehicle both longitudinally and laterally and poses no immediate risk.

**Risk Levels and Definitions:**
<Collision (Score: 0)>: Actual collision has occurred or is unavoidable within the next timestep.
<Extreme Risk (Score: 1)>: Immediate collision or very high likelihood of impact. Urgent action is required.
<High Risk (Score: 2)>: Close to collision or highly probable collision path. Needs prompt attention and quick manoeuvring.
<Medium Risk (Score: 3)>: Moderate collision risk but manageable with timely reactions and proper strategies.
<Low Risk (Score: 4)>: Minimal collision risk. The situation is controllable with sufficient time to react.
<Negligible Risk (Score: 5)>: No significant collision risk. Obstacles are either moving away or far enough not to interfere.
