### Safety analysis for timestep 0.9 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 20042**
- **Distance Risk reason:** Obstacle 20042 is located in front of the ego vehicle at a longitudinal distance of 23.39m and a lateral distance of 23.39m.  While the lateral distance suggests no immediate collision risk, the longitudinal distance is decreasing rapidly, as evidenced by the negative relative velocity (-21.03 m/s). This indicates the obstacle is approaching the ego vehicle head-on.
- **Distance safety score:** 3 (Medium Risk)
- **Time Risk reason:** The high closing speed (-21.03 m/s) coupled with a decreasing distance poses a serious risk of collision in the near future.  Assuming constant velocity, a rough estimate of TTC (Time to Collision) is slightly over 1 second. Although negative relative velocity does not have physical meaning when calculating TTC, it is a key factor in collision prediction. 
- **Time safety score:** 2 (High Risk)
- **Overall Risk score:** 2 (High Risk - Dominated by the high closing speed and short TTC)

- **Obstacle ID: 20063**
- **Distance Risk reason:** Obstacle 20063 is in the front-right of the ego car, with both longitudinal and lateral distances of 23.55m. The positive and increasing longitudinal and lateral distances coupled with the positive relative velocities (3.58 m/s longitudinal, -4.63 m/s lateral) indicate the obstacle is moving away from the ego vehicleâ€™s path.
- **Distance safety score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)
- **Time Risk reason:** Since the obstacle is moving away from the ego vehicle both longitudinally and laterally, the TTC values are not relevant in terms of a collision risk.
- **Time safety score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)
- **Overall Risk score:** 5 (Negligible Risk)


### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
  "CollisionObstacle": null,
  "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {
    "ObstacleID": "20042",
    "OverallRiskScore": "2"
 },
  "IsCollisionScenario": false,
  "Justification": "While no immediate collision is detected in the current timestep (0.9 seconds), Obstacle 20042 exhibits a high risk of collision in the immediate future due to its high closing speed and trajectory directly towards the ego vehicle.  Therefore, this situation is flagged as high risk (Overall Risk Score 2 for Obstacle 20042), demanding prompt attention and mitigative actions."
