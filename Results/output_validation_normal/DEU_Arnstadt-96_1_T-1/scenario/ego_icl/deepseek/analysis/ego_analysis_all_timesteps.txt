### Obstacle-by-Obstacle Analysis

#### Obstacle 20042 (Front of ego car at 0.9s)
- **Adjusted Distances**: Longitudinal = 23.39m, Lateral = 0.00m
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal = -21.03 m/s (approaching), Lateral = 4.70 m/s (moving right)
- **Motion Description**: Obstacle is driving toward the ego car longitudinally. Exact lateral alignment.
  
**Trajectory Analysis**:
- The obstacle is directly in front of the ego car (lateral alignment = 0.00m) and closing the longitudinal distance rapidly (relative velocity = -21.03 m/s).
- Over the last two timesteps (0.8s to 0.9s), the longitudinal distance decreased from 25.48m to 23.39m, confirming rapid approach.

**TTC Calculation**:
- Longitudinal TTC = 23.39m / 21.03 m/s â‰ˆ 1.11 seconds
- Lateral TTC: Not applicable (lateral distance is stable/increasing due to positive lateral velocity).

**MDC Calculation**:
- Since the obstacle is longitudinally aligned (lateral = 0.00m), MDC is effectively the longitudinal distance (23.39m), but the rapid closing velocity makes this a high-risk scenario.

**Risk Assessment**:
- TTC (1.11s) falls into Medium Risk (3).
- However, the rapid closing speed and exact lateral alignment elevate this to High Risk (2).

#### Obstacle 20063 (Front-right of ego car at 0.9s)
- **Adjusted Distances**: Longitudinal = 23.55m, Lateral = -1.80m
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal = 3.58 m/s (moving away), Lateral = -4.63 m/s (moving right)
- **Motion Description**: Obstacle is moving away longitudinally and laterally to the right.

**Trajectory Analysis**:
- The obstacle is moving away from the ego car in both dimensions (positive longitudinal velocity, negative lateral velocity).
- Over the timesteps, both longitudinal and lateral distances are increasing.

**TTC Calculation**:
- Not applicable (relative velocities are diverging in both dimensions).

**MDC Calculation**:
- Current distance is large (longitudinal = 23.55m, lateral = 1.80m), and increasing.

**Risk Assessment**:
- No Risk (5).

### Final Risk Scores
- **Obstacle 20042**: High Risk (2)
- **Obstacle 20063**: No Risk (5)

### Collision Scenario Determination
This is **not** a collision scenario because:
1. No obstacle has a risk score of 0 (collision) or 1 (extreme risk).
2. Obstacle 20042 is at High Risk (2), but the TTC (1.11s) and MDC (23.39m) do not indicate imminent collision.
3. Obstacle 20063 poses no risk.
