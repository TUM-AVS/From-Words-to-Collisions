Obstacle-by-Obstacle Analysis at t=0.9s:

**Obstacle 20042:**

* **Trajectory:**  This obstacle appears at t=0.8s directly in front of the ego vehicle (lateral distance 0.00m). Over the subsequent timestep, the longitudinal distance rapidly decreases from 25.48m to 23.39m, indicating high closing velocity. The lateral distance remains at 0.00m.
* **TTC (Longitudinal):** Distance / |Relative Velocity| = 23.39m / |-21.03 m/s| ≈ 1.11 seconds
* **MDC:**  Given the exact lateral alignment and rapid longitudinal closing, MDC is essentially the longitudinal distance, which is 23.39m. 
* **Risk Assessment:**
    * Longitudinal Risk: Medium Risk (TTC < 3.0s)
    * Lateral Risk: High Risk (MDC < 1.0 if we consider it as a collision, because it is not moving laterally)
    * Overall Risk: Medium Risk (prioritizing higher risk based on TTC)

**Obstacle 20063:**

* **Trajectory:** This obstacle has been consistently to the front-right of the ego vehicle, moving away both longitudinally and laterally. The lateral distance increases over time and the longitudinal distance also increases over time, despite it being slightly closer at t=0.9s compared to t=0.8s.
* **TTC (Longitudinal):** Distance / |Relative Velocity| = 23.55m / |3.58 m/s| ≈ 6.58 seconds
* **TTC (Lateral):** Distance / |Relative Velocity| = |-1.80m| / |-4.63 m/s| ≈ 0.39 seconds 
* **MDC:**  Given the diagonal movement, the MDC is difficult to determine precisely without further trajectory information. Given that it is moving away longitudinally, the MDC may be near 1.80.
* **Risk Assessment:**
    * Longitudinal Risk: No Risk (TTC > 5.0s)
    * Lateral Risk: Extreme Risk (TTC < 0.5s)
    * Overall Risk: Extreme Risk (prioritizing the higher risk)



**Collision Scenario Determination:**

Yes, this is a collision scenario because Obstacle 20063 poses an Extreme Risk (Overall Risk Score 1 with a very low lateral TTC of 0.39 seconds). Although Obstacle 20063 is on the front-right and laterally moving away from the ego vehicle, the consistent trajectory shows a collision with the ego vehicle side if no lateral movement is applied to the ego.
