Let's evaluate the risk of collision in the most recent timestep (0.9 seconds) for obstacles 20063 and 20042.

### Trajectory Analysis Across Timesteps

1. **Obstacle 20042:** The obstacle was first observed at 0.8 seconds and is driving toward the ego vehicle in a head-on manner.
   - **Trajectory Observation:** High relative closing speed towards the ego vehicle, and the motion description indicates a direct approach in the longitudinal direction (exact lateral alignment).

2. **Obstacle 20063:** Consistently observed from 0.1 to 0.9 seconds in the front-right with increasing longitudinal distance and varying lateral distances.
   - **Trajectory Observation:** Moving away both longitudinally and laterally from the ego vehicle, which suggests diverging trajectories.

### Obstacle-by-Obstacle Analysis (Based on 0.9 seconds)

#### Obstacle 20042

- **Adjusted Distances:**
  - Longitudinal: 23.39 m
  - Lateral: 0.00 m (exact alignment)

- **Relative Velocities:**
  - Longitudinal: -21.03 m/s (approaching)
  - Lateral: 4.70 m/s (away)

- **TTC Calculation:**
  - Longitudinal: 23.39 m / 21.03 m/s = 1.11 seconds

- **Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC):**
  - Since the lateral distance is 0.00 m and the obstacle is heading directly towards the ego, MDC is primarily in the longitudinal direction: 23.39 m.

- **Risk Assessment:**
  - **TTC = 1.11 seconds:** Indicates high risk (score 2) due to rapid approach.
  - **MDC = 23.39 m:** Indicates no risk (score 5), but trajectory suggests a head-on approach.

- **Conclusion:** The overall risk score is aligned more closely with TTC indicating a high risk of collision without intervention.

#### Obstacle 20063

- **Adjusted Distances:**
  - Longitudinal: 23.55 m
  - Lateral: -1.80 m

- **Relative Velocities:**
  - Longitudinal: 3.58 m/s (moving away)
  - Lateral: -4.63 m/s (moving away)

- **TTC Calculation:**
  - Longitudinal: Not applicable since itâ€™s moving away.
  - Lateral: Not applicable as moving away laterally.

- **Minimum Distance to Collision (MDC):**
  - No crossing trajectory and increasing distances indicate low risk, confirmed by the separation motion description.

- **Risk Assessment:**
  - Moving away both longitudinally and laterally suggests no imminent collision.
  - **Overall Risk Score:** 5 (No risk)

### Conclusion

- **Collision Scenario Determination:**
  - Despite high relative speed, obstacle 20042 presents a high, not extreme risk due to limited time exposure in scenarios presented.
  - No collision is explicitly occurring as of the last reliable timestep data.

- **Scenario Evaluation:** This is a high-risk scenario but does not meet the threshold for a collision occurring in the precise moment assessed.
