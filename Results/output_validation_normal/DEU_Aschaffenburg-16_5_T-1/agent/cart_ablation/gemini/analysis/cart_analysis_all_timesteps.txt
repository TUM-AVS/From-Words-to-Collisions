Obstacle 30381 is consistently close to the ego vehicle and shows a concerning trend.  At t=0.1s, it's at (452.0632, -161.0693) while the ego vehicle is at (450.1951, -176.4289).  While not extremely close at this point, the obstacle's position relative to the ego vehicle continues to get closer over the next few timesteps. The y-coordinates are converging, indicating potential lane changes or merging scenarios. By t=0.9s, the obstacle is at (452.5076, -156.9954) and has changed to the ego vehicle's lane (lanelet 1934). Given the decreasing distance and converging trajectories with a potential lane change, this obstacle poses a high risk of collision.
