At t=0.9s, the ego vehicle is at (450.7565, -171.996) with a velocity of 4.1624 and acceleration of -0.8793.  Let's analyze the risk posed by each obstacle at this timestep:

* **Obstacle 30370:** Located at (427.1766, -163.6478), this obstacle poses no immediate threat. It's laterally separated and its longitudinal motion doesn't suggest an imminent collision.  While more data points would be beneficial for a precise TTC calculation, the current information indicates low risk.

* **Obstacle 30376:**  Stationary at (462.8562, -148.5861). This obstacle is also laterally and longitudinally separated, presenting no immediate risk.

* **Obstacle 30377:** Located at (453.5956, -142.8852) and moving with a velocity of 1.5364. Similar to the previous obstacles, this one is far enough away to be considered low risk currently.

* **Obstacle 30380:** At (462.6693, -152.4246) with a velocity of 2.0443.  Again, lateral and longitudinal separation suggest low risk at this moment.

* **Obstacle 30381:** Positioned at (452.5076, -156.9954), this obstacle is the closest to the ego vehicle. While the y-coordinate difference suggests some lateral separation, the x-coordinate difference is relatively small, warranting closer attention.  A precise TTC calculation is difficult with the available data, but the proximity and the ego vehicle's deceleration, alongside the different orientation, require labeling this obstacle a Potential High Risk at this specific moment. 


Based on the positions, velocities, and the limited timeframe of the provided data, none of the obstacles present an immediate collision risk (score 0) or extreme risk (score 1). Obstacle 30381 shows signs of a Potential High Risk based on proximity which I assign a risk score of 2. All other vehicles are considered low risk (score 4) in this specific time step.  Further data points would be necessary for more precise risk assessment and TTC calculations.
