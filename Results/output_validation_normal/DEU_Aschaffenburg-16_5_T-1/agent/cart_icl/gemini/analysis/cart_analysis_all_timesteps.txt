At t=0.9s, the ego vehicle's velocity is decreasing, suggesting braking. Let's analyze the risk posed by each obstacle at this timestep:

* **Obstacle 30370:** Located far away laterally and longitudinally, posing no immediate threat. Negligible risk.

* **Obstacle 30376:** Stationary and far from the ego vehicle's trajectory. Negligible risk.

* **Obstacle 30377:**  Laterally distant and moving slower than the ego vehicle, slight risk.  Low risk.

* **Obstacle 30380:** Located ahead of the ego vehicle, with a small lateral distance.  The ego vehicle is decelerating while this obstacle's velocity shows recent fluctuations, making it difficult to accurately predict future behavior without more data.  The closing longitudinal velocity indicates a potential risk, although the risk is mitigated somewhat by the ego vehicle's deceleration. Medium risk.

* **Obstacle 30381:** This obstacle is in a similar lanelet to the ego vehicle (1934) at this snapshot and is relatively close. Requires closer attention.  A rough TTC calculation is possible, but its accuracy depends on maintaining current acceleration trends. High risk.
