### Analysis

At **0.9 seconds**, the focus is on the Ego and surrounding obstacles:

- **Ego Vehicle**:
  - Position: (450.7565, -171.996)
  - Velocity: 4.1624 m/s
  - Acceleration: -0.8793 m/s²
  - Located in lanelet 580.0

- **Obstacle 30370**:
  - Position: (427.1766, -163.6478)
  - Velocity: 2.1554 m/s
  - Relative position: behind and to the side
  - **No immediate collision risk**: Given the relative longitudinal and lateral distance, this obstacle remains well behind the ego without a direct path to cause a collision.

- **Obstacle 30376**:
  - Position: (462.8562, -148.5861)
  - Velocity: 0 m/s (stationary)
  - Located in a different lanelet (598.0)
  - **Negligible risk**: This stationary obstacle poses no immediate risk as it is located far and not in interaction with the ego's trajectory.

- **Obstacle 30377**:
  - Position: (453.5956, -142.8852)
  - Velocity: 1.5364 m/s
  - Acceleration: 0.2751 m/s²
  - Located in lanelet 595.0
  - **No immediate risk**: Sufficient distance and located in another lanelet.

- **Obstacle 30380**:
  - Position: (462.6693, -152.4246)
  - Velocity: 2.0443 m/s
  - Acceleration: -0.1532 m/s²
  - Located in lanelet 599.0
  - **No immediate risk**: Positioned in a different lanelet and far from Ego.

- **Obstacle 30381**:
  - Position: (452.5076, -156.9954)
  - Velocity: 4.5004 m/s
  - Acceleration: -2.1766 m/s²
  - Movement towards ego's direction with a decreasing velocity.
  - **Medium Risk/Manageable**: As Ego's lanelet is 580.0 and Obstacle 30381 comes from lanelet 1934.0, their paths do not immediately merge; however, the closing speed and trajectory in shared space (lanes can merge/intersect) suggests a medium level of risk.

There are no direct collision or extreme risk obstacles detected at the most recent timestamp.
