### Safety analysis for timestep 0.9 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

**Assumptions and Clarifications:**

* Since adjusted distances (adjusted_d_long, adjusted_d_lat) are not provided in the scenario context, raw DTClong and DTClat will be used for this analysis.  This will impact the accuracy of the risk assessment.  **Providing adjusted distances is crucial for a realistic evaluation.**
* TTC will be calculated assuming constant velocity.  Since acceleration data is provided, a more accurate TTC calculation involving acceleration is possible but not performed here due to complexity.
*  A simplified risk assessment logic is used based on distance and TTC thresholds due to the lack of adjusted distances.  These thresholds would ideally be calibrated based on vehicle size, dynamics, and acceptable risk tolerances.

**TTC Calculation:**
TTClong = DTClong / Vrel_long
TTClat = DTClat / Vrel_lat

*Note: Negative TTC values indicate the obstacle is moving away.*
