Obstacle 30370:
- Trajectory: Consistently approaching the ego vehicle from the front-left. Longitudinal distance decreasing rapidly, lateral distance decreasing slowly.
- At 0.9s: Longitudinal distance 0.82m, Lateral distance 22.83m, Longitudinal velocity -3.24 m/s, Lateral velocity -1.95 m/s.
- TTC (longitudinal): 0.82m / 3.24m/s = 0.25s
- TTC (lateral): 22.83m / 1.95m/s = 11.7s
- MDC: Due to diagonal approach and faster closing in the longitudinal direction, focus on longitudinal distance. MDC ≈ 0.82m.
- Risk Assessment: TTC (longitudinal) indicates Extreme Risk (1), MDC indicates High Risk (2). Prioritize higher risk: Extreme Risk (1).

Obstacle 30376:
- Trajectory: Consistently approaching the ego vehicle from the front-right. Longitudinal distance decreasing, lateral distance slightly changing near a constant value around -7.46 m.
- At 0.9s: Longitudinal distance 20.23m, Lateral distance -7.46m, Longitudinal velocity -4.16 m/s, Lateral velocity 0 m/s.
- TTC (longitudinal): 20.23m / 4.16m/s = 4.86s
- TTC (lateral): N/A due to no relative lateral velocity.
- MDC: ≈ 7.46m.
- Risk Assessment: TTC (longitudinal) indicates Low risk (4), MDC indicates Negligible risk (5). Prioritize higher risk: Low risk (4).

Obstacle 30377:
- Trajectory: Approaching from the front.
- At 0.9s: Longitudinal distance 24.73m, Lateral distance 0.00m, Longitudinal velocity -2.63 m/s, Lateral velocity 0.11 m/s.
- TTC (longitudinal): 24.73m / 2.63m/s = 9.4s
- TTC (lateral): Not applicable due to no relative motion or even slightly moving away from the ego vehicle
- MDC: Given the exact lateral alignment and closing longitudinal distance, MDC is primarily longitudinal: ≈ 24.73m
- Risk Assessment: TTC (longitudinal) indicates No risk (5), MDC indicates no risk (5). Overall: No risk (5).

Obstacle 30380:
- Trajectory: Approaching from the front-right. Longitudinal distance is decreasing, lateral distance is increasing.
- At 0.9s: Longitudinal distance 16.40m, Lateral distance -7.75m, Longitudinal velocity -3.24 m/s, Lateral velocity -1.82 m/s.
- TTC (longitudinal): 16.40m / 3.24m/s = 5.06s
- TTC (lateral): Not applicable. It is moving away from the ego car laterally.
- MDC: ≈ 7.75m
- Risk Assessment: TTC (longitudinal) indicates Negligible risk (5), MDC indicates Negligible risk (5). Overall: Negligible risk (5).


Obstacle 30381:
- Trajectory: Moving away longitudinally.
- At 0.9s: Longitudinal distance 10.59m, Lateral distance 0.00m, Longitudinal velocity 0.34m/s, Lateral velocity 0.08 m/s.
- TTC (longitudinal): Not applicable
- TTC (lateral): Not applicable
- MDC: ≈ 10.59m
- Risk Assessment: Negligible risk (5).
