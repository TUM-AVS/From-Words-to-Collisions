At t=0.9s, Ego (450.7565, -171.996) is closest to Obstacle 30381 (452.5076, -156.9954). While the y-coordinate difference is significant, the x-coordinate difference is small and decreasing over the previous timesteps. Additionally, both Ego and Obstacle 30381 are decelerating. Obstacle 30381 has transitioned to lanelet 1934.0, implying potential lane change behavior.  It's difficult to say with certainty if the lane change maneuver will be completed safely or if it will lead to a collision with Ego. Due to the small x-difference and the ongoing lane change, this situation represents a high risk. Other obstacles are sufficiently far from Ego and do not pose an immediate threat.
