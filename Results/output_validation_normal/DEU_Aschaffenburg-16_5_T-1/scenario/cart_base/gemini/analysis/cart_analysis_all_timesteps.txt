At t=0.9s, Ego (450.7565, -171.996) is closest to Obstacle 30381 (452.5076, -156.9954). While the y-coordinates differ significantly, the x-coordinates are close. Obstacle 30381 has changed lanelets from 1729 to 1934, which is a lanelet change maneuver that could put it in the path of the Ego vehicle. Given the x-coordinate proximity and sudden lane change, this is a high risk but not yet extreme as the lane change hasn't fully materialized to a collision course yet. We need more data from subsequent time steps to confirm if a collision is imminent. Other obstacles are farther away and pose no immediate threat.
