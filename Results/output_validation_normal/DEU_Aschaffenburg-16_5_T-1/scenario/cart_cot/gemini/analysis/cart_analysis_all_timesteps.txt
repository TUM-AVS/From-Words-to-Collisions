### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 30370.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 30370.0 is located in a different lanelet and its X and Y coordinates indicate a significant lateral and longitudinal separation from the ego vehicle.  The historical trajectory shows it moving away from the ego vehicle's path.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: The obstacle's velocity and acceleration, observed over multiple timesteps, do not pose a threat to the ego vehicle given its trajectory and lanelet.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 30376.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 30376.0 is stationary and located in a different lanelet, presenting no immediate risk. Its historical trajectory confirms its static nature. However, it's moderately close to the ego vehicle's projected path, warranting monitoring.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason:  The obstacle is stationary, posing no dynamic risk based on its velocity and acceleration.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 4

- Obstacle ID: 30377.0
- Distance Risk reason: This obstacle is relatively far from the ego vehicle and in a different lanelet at the last timestep. Historical data suggests it's not on a converging course.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: The obstacle's slow speed and minimal acceleration, observed over the given timeframe, present no immediate time-related risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 30380.0
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 30380.0 is located in a different lanelet. Its X and Y coordinates at the last timestep, combined with its historical trajectory, indicate separation from the ego vehicle.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: While the obstacle's velocity is relatively low, its proximity and the observed fluctuations in its acceleration warrant continued monitoring.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- Obstacle ID: 30381.0
- Distance Risk reason:  At the final timestep, Obstacle 30381.0 is in a different lanelet, but its Y coordinate is relatively close to the ego vehicle, suggesting a moderate lateral distance risk.  Examining the history reveals it has been consistently close to the ego and moving in a similar direction.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: This obstacle's velocity and acceleration, observed over multiple timesteps, although decreasing, indicate potential risk due to proximity and the shared general direction of travel.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3


### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. **Most critical obstacle:** Obstacle 30381.0 poses the most immediate concern due to consistent proximity and a similar direction of travel as the ego vehicle, even though in a different lanelet.
2. **Trajectory analysis:** Over the 10 timesteps, 30381.0 maintains a course roughly parallel to the ego vehicle.
3. **Relative position, velocity, and acceleration:**  30381.0's Y-coordinate remains close to the ego vehicle's throughout the scenario. Its velocity is higher than the ego vehicle, but is decelerating.
4. **Collision determination:** No collision has occurred within the first 0.9 seconds.  However, the continued proximity and relatively higher velocity of 30381.0 warrant close observation for potential future collisions.
5. **Reasoning:** Although no imminent collision is detected, the relative positions and velocities of 30381.0 and the ego vehicle create a situation that necessitates careful monitoring.

### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
  "CollisionObstacles": null,
  "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null,
  "ScenarioAnalysis": {
    "IsCollisionScenario": false,
    "Reasoning": "No collision has occurred within the analyzed timeframe. Obstacle 30381.0 presents the highest risk due to its consistent proximity and similar trajectory to the ego vehicle, although it remains in a different lanelet. Continued monitoring is necessary to ensure safety, but no immediate collision is predicted based on the current data."
