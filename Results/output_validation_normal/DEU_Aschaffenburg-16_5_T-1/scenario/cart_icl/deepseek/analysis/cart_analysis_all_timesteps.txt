### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep (0.9 seconds):

### Obstacle Analysis:
1. **Obstacle ID: 30370**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is moving away from the ego vehicle (X-coordinate increasing, Y-coordinate decreasing). The distance is large (~24m in X, ~8m in Y).
   - **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: Relative velocity is low (ego decelerating, obstacle moving slowly). No convergence in trajectories.
   - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 5

2. **Obstacle ID: 30376**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Static obstacle far from ego's path (~12m in X, ~23m in Y).
   - **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: No movement (velocity = 0).
   - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 5

3. **Obstacle ID: 30377**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Moving perpendicular to ego's path (~7m in X, ~29m in Y). No intersection.
   - **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: Low velocity and orthogonal trajectory.
   - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 5

4. **Obstacle ID: 30380**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Moving parallel but away from ego (~12m in X, ~20m in Y).
   - **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: Low relative velocity and diverging paths.
   - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 5

5. **Obstacle ID: 30381**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Closest obstacle (~2m in X, ~15m in Y), but trajectories are not converging.
   - **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: Similar orientation but decelerating. Relative velocity is manageable.
   - **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 4

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. No obstacles are in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle (lanelet 580).
2. All obstacles are either static or moving away from the ego's path.
3. The closest obstacle (30381) is decelerating and not on a collision course.
4. No convergence in trajectories observed over the 9 timesteps.
5. Ego vehicle is decelerating, reducing risk further.
