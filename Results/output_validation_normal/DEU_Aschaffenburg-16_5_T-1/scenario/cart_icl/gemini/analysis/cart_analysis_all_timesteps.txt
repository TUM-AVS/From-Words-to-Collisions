### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
No obstacles pose an immediate collision risk. Obstacle 30381 is the closest but the different lanelets and ego vehicle's and obstacle's trajectories suggest no collision. This is not a collision scenario.

### Summary in JSON Format: 
```json
{
  "CollisionObstacles": null,
  "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null,
  "ScenarioAnalysis": {
    "IsCollisionScenario": false,
    "Reasoning": "No obstacle has a risk score of 0 or 1. The closest obstacle (30381) is in a different lanelet and their trajectories do not intersect, indicating no immediate collision risk."
  }
}
```
