Obstacle 30370 shows a very high risk of collision.  At 0.9 seconds, it is only 0.82 meters longitudinally and 22.83 meters laterally from the ego vehicle.  While the lateral distance seems large, the longitudinal distance is extremely close, suggesting an imminent collision if the ego vehicle does not take immediate action. The relative longitudinal velocity also indicates that the obstacle is approaching the ego vehicle rapidly.
