Obstacle 30370 is at high risk of collision.  It is only 0.82m in front of the ego vehicle longitudinally and closing at a speed of -3.24 m/s. While the lateral distance is significant (22.83m), the closing lateral velocity (-1.95 m/s) suggests a potential collision course if the ego vehicle continues on its current path.
