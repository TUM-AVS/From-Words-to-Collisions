### Safety analysis for timestep 0.9 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 30370**
- Distance Risk reason: Extremely close proximity (0.82m longitudinal and lateral) in the front-left direction indicates imminent collision.
- Distance safety score: 1 (Extreme Risk)
- Time Risk reason:  Given the closing velocities and minimal distance, TTC is virtually zero.
- Time safety score: 1 (Extreme Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 1 (Extreme Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 30376**
- Distance Risk reason:  Located 20.23m longitudinally and laterally in the front-right, presenting no immediate danger.
- Distance safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- Time Risk reason:  While approaching, the distance and lateral movement suggest ample time to react.
- Time safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 5 (Negligible Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 30377**
- Distance Risk reason: Situated 24.73m longitudinally and laterally in front; poses no immediate threat.
- Distance safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- Time Risk reason:  Although moving closer, the considerable distance allows for sufficient reaction time.
- Time safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 5 (Negligible Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 30380**
- Distance Risk reason: At 16.40m longitudinally and laterally in the front-right, presents no immediate risk.
- Distance safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- Time Risk reason: Closing velocity exists, but the distance provides a reasonable buffer for reaction.
- Time safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 5 (Negligible Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 30381**
- Distance Risk reason:  Located 10.59m longitudinally and laterally in front, posing no immediate threat but requiring monitoring.
- Distance safety score: 4 (Low Risk)
- Time Risk reason: Currently moving away longitudinally, further diminishing risk.
- Time safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 4 (Low Risk)


### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
  "CollisionObstacle": null,
  "ExtremeRiskObstacle": {
    "ObstacleID": "30370",
    "OverallRiskScore": "1"
  },
  "IsCollisionScenario": false,
  "Justification": "Obstacle 30370 poses an extreme risk with a very high likelihood of collision due to its proximity (0.82m) and closing velocity. While not yet a collision, immediate action is required to avoid impact."
}
