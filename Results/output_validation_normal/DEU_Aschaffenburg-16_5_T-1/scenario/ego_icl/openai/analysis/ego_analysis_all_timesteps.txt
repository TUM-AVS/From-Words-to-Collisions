### Obstacle-By-Obstacle Risk Analysis:

#### Obstacle 30370 (Front-Left)
- **Adjusted Longitudinal Distance (final):** 0.82 m
- **Adjusted Lateral Distance (final):** 22.83 m
- **Relative Velocity (longitudinal):** -3.24 m/s
- **Relative Acceleration (longitudinal):** -0.06 m/s²
- **Trajectory Analysis:** The obstacle has moved from 4.55 m to 0.82 m in longitudinal distance over 0.8 seconds, indicating a steady approach.
- **TTC (Longitudinal):** 0.82 m / 3.24 m/s = 0.253 seconds
- **MDC (Longitudinal):** 0.82 m
- **Risk Assessment:** With a TTC of 0.253s and MDC of 0.82m, both indicate a high risk (1 on TTC and 2 on MDC), but prioritize TTC giving overall **Extreme Risk** (1).

#### Obstacle 30376 (Front-Right)
- **Adjusted Longitudinal Distance (final):** 20.23 m
- **Adjusted Lateral Distance (final):** -7.46 m
- **Relative Velocity (longitudinal):** -4.16 m/s
- **Relative Acceleration (longitudinal):** 0.11 m/s²
- **Trajectory Analysis:** The obstacle is maintaining a trajectory towards the ego vehicle with reducing distance based on decreasing velocity.
- **TTC (Longitudinal):** Not immediate risk as the longitudinal distance is reasonably large.
- **MDC (Longitudinal):** 20.23 m
- **Risk Assessment:** With a TTC not applicable for immediate risk (due to larger separation and velocity trends), MDC greater than 5m, overall **No Risk** (5).

#### Obstacle 30377 (Front)
- **Adjusted Longitudinal Distance (final):** 24.73 m
- **Adjusted Lateral Distance (final):** 0.00 m
- **Relative Velocity (longitudinal):** -2.63 m/s
- **Relative Acceleration (longitudinal):** 0.13 m/s²
- **Trajectory Analysis:** The obstacle is approaching but at a controlled velocity with no immediate collision forecasted.
- **TTC (Longitudinal):** Not critical within the analyzed timeframe.
- **MDC (Longitudinal):** 24.73 m
- **Risk Assessment:** With TTC not critical and significant longitudinal distance maintained, overall **No Risk** (5).

#### Obstacle 30380 (Front-Right)
- **Adjusted Longitudinal Distance (final):** 16.40 m
- **Adjusted Lateral Distance (final):** -7.75 m
- **Relative Velocity (longitudinal):** -3.24 m/s
- **Relative Acceleration (longitudinal):** -0.03 m/s²
- **Trajectory Analysis:** The obstacle maintains a mostly constant approach vector with significant separation to avoid immediate risk.
- **TTC (Longitudinal):** Not applicable for immediate risk given overall distance and closing speed.
- **MDC (Longitudinal):** 16.40 m
- **Risk Assessment:** No immediate collision risk due to significant distance and velocity trends, overall **No Risk** (5).

#### Obstacle 30381 (Front)
- **Adjusted Longitudinal Distance (final):** 10.59 m
- **Adjusted Lateral Distance (final):** 0.00 m
- **Relative Velocity (longitudinal):** Moving away (0.34 m/s)
- **Trajectory Analysis:** Distance is stable or slightly increasing, meaning the obstacle is deviating away.
- **TTC and MDC Assessment:** Not needed as the obstacle is moving away.
- **Risk Assessment:** With stability or increasing separation, **No Risk** (5).

### Conclusion and Collision Scenario Determination:
The calculated TTC for Obstacle 30370 identifies it as having an Extreme Risk (1) due to a high closing rate. This obstacle presents an immediate concern for collision as it manifests a trajectory toward the ego car with very near clearance at the end of the monitored period.
