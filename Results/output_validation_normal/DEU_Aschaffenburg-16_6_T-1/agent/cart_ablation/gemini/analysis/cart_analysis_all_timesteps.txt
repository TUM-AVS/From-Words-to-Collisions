Obstacle 30377 is showing a concerning trend.  It's in the same lanelet (1729) as the ego vehicle and its y-coordinate is getting closer to the ego vehicle's y-coordinate over time. While a collision hasn't happened yet, the continued decrease in the relative distance combined with the ego vehicle's deceleration and obstacle 30377's deceleration (although fluctuating) raises significant concern about a potential collision in the next few timesteps if the trends continue.

Obstacle 30381, while in a different lanelet initially (580),  presents a longer-term risk. It is traveling much faster than the ego vehicle and accelerating. Although not an immediate threat, its high speed and acceleration require monitoring.
