Here's a collision risk analysis of the provided scenario focusing on the last timestep (0.9 seconds) and considering the trajectories from previous timesteps:

**Ego Vehicle State at t=0.9s:**

* Position: (453.4637, -158.9666)
* Orientation: 1.1081628227290263 radians
* Velocity: 4.3154 
* Acceleration: -1.4182

**Obstacles Analysis at t=0.9s:**

* **Obstacle 30372:**
    * Position: (447.7897, -162.7724)
    * Based on its trajectory, this obstacle poses minimal risk.  It is moving slowly and its y-coordinate is diverging from the ego vehicle.  It's unlikely to cause problems in the immediate future.
    * Risk Score: 5 (Negligible Risk)

* **Obstacle 30373:**
    * Position: (453.8657, -137.6669)
    * Trajectory analysis suggests no immediate risk. The obstacle's Y position is significantly far from the ego vehicle.
    * Risk Score: 5 (Negligible Risk)

* **Obstacle 30376:**
    * Position: (462.8562, -148.5861)
    * Static obstacle, no apparent risk based on the current information.
    * Risk Score: 5 (Negligible Risk)

* **Obstacle 30377:**
    * Position: (453.259, -148.0493)
    * This obstacle shares a similar X coordinate with the ego vehicle, but with a significantly different Y coordinate, suggesting no imminent collision risk. Future timesteps are needed to ensure full safety.
    * Risk Score: 5 (Negligible Risk)

* **Obstacle 30378:**
    * Position: (450.2098, -140.7422)
    * Static obstacle, no apparent risk.
    * Risk Score: 5 (Negligible Risk)


* **Obstacle 30381:**
    * Position: (450.5209, -173.8434)
    * This obstacle is behind the ego vehicle and traveling in the same general direction (based on lanelet and prior motion). The difference in Y coordinates suggests some longitudinal separation. However, the high velocity and fluctuating acceleration require close monitoring in the coming timesteps. The difference in Y is decreasing, which raises concern.
    * Risk Score: 4 (Low Risk)



* **Obstacle 30383:**
    * Position: (450.5894, -133.1507)
    * Not a collision risk, located far from ego vehicle in Y coordinate.
    * Risk Score: 5 (Negligible Risk)

* **Obstacle 30384:**
    * Position: (470.1671, -146.34)
    * No immediate risk due to lateral and longitudinal separation.
    * Risk Score: 5 (Negligible Risk)


**Summary of Findings:**

Based on the available data and primarily focusing on the 0.9-second timestep, no immediate collisions are predicted.  Obstacle 30381 warrants monitoring due to its relatively close proximity, high speed, and fluctuating acceleration.  Future timesteps are needed to confirm the safety of the ego vehicle's trajectory fully.
