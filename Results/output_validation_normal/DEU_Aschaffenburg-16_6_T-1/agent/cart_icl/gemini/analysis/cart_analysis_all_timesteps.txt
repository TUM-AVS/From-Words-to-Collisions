Here's the collision risk assessment for the provided scenario focusing on t=0.9s:

**Analysis of Risky Obstacles:**

* **Obstacle 30377:** This obstacle is in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle and is relatively close.  While the data shows some fluctuations in velocity, the overall trend suggests the vehicles are moving in a similar direction and the obstacle's velocity is slower than the ego vehicle, there is a risk of collision if the ego vehicle continues to decelerate at the current rate. Risk level is downgraded to High Risk due to the lack of continuous data and the ego vehicle's deceleration trend.
