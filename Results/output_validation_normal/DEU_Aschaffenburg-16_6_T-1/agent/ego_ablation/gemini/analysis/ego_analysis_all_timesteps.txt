At t=0.9s, Obstacle 30377 is closest to the ego vehicle with a longitudinal distance of 5.17m and a lateral distance of 3.45m, making it a potential high-risk obstacle. Although it's moving away laterally from the ego car, it's still approaching longitudinally at -1.91 m/s. Considering the distances, relative velocity, and that this is a predicted trajectory over a short time horizon, this warrants attention.

Obstacle 30376, at a longitudinal distance of 8.97m and lateral distance of -2.16m, is also concerning as it is approaching the ego car longitudinally at -4.32 m/s with no lateral movement. This also constitutes a potential risk.


Obstacle 30372 is now behind the ego car, so any risk from this obstacle is reduced. Obstacle 30381 is behind the ego vehicle and is considered a low risk.

All other obstacles are sufficiently far away to be considered low risk at this specific timestep.
