### Safety analysis for timestep 0.9s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

**Assumptions and Clarifications:**

* Since adjusted distances (adjusted_d_long, adjusted_d_lat) are not provided in the scenario context, the provided real distances (DTClong, DTClat) will be used for this analysis.  This is not ideal and would lead to less precise risk assessments in a real-world application.  **It is strongly recommended to provide adjusted distances for accurate collision analysis.**
* TTC will be approximated based on current velocity and distance. More sophisticated TTC calculations, incorporating acceleration and predicting future trajectories, are generally recommended for autonomous driving.
* A simplified risk assessment logic will be applied based on distance and TTC thresholds due to the lack of adjusted distances and more advanced motion prediction information.

**Risk Assessment Logic (Simplified):**

* **Distance:**
    * 0-2m: Collision/Extreme Risk (scores 0-1)
    * 2-5m: High Risk (score 2)
    * 5-10m: Medium Risk (score 3)
    * 10-20m: Low Risk (score 4)
    * >20m: Negligible Risk (score 5)
* **TTC:**
    * <1s: Collision/Extreme Risk (scores 0-1)
    * 1-3s: High Risk (score 2)
    * 3-5s: Medium Risk (score 3)
    * 5-7s: Low Risk (score 4)
    * >7s: Negligible Risk (score 5)

* **Overall Risk:**  The minimum of the Distance and Time risk scores.
