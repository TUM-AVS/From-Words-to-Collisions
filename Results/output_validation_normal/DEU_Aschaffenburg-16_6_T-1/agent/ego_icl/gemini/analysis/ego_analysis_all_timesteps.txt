Obstacle 30372: Located rear-left of the ego vehicle.  The lateral distance has decreased across timesteps, indicating lateral movement towards the ego vehicle.  The longitudinal distance has become slightly negative in the last timestep, meaning it's now slightly behind the ego vehicle. The small negative longitudinal distance combined with a negative longitudinal velocity suggests the obstacle is moving away longitudinally, having just passed the ego vehicle.  Since the lateral distance is still significant (1.77m) and the longitudinal motion is diverging, the risk is low despite the recent close proximity.  
* TTC (Lateral): 1.77m / 0.96 m/s = 1.84s (Medium Risk)
* MDC: Approximately 1.77m (Medium Risk)
* Overall Risk: Medium (3)

Obstacle 30373: Located front-left. Both longitudinal and lateral distances are increasing, showing diverging motion. No risk.
* TTC (Longitudinal): 14.73m / 2.54m/s = 5.80s (Negligible Risk)
* MDC: > 5.0m (Negligible Risk)
* Overall Risk: Negligible (5)


Obstacle 30376: Located front-right. Longitudinal distance is decreasing, indicating an approaching obstacle. The lateral distance is also decreasing but remains substantial.
* TTC (Longitudinal): 8.97m / 4.32m/s = 2.08s (High Risk)
* MDC:  Approximately derived from longitudinal and lateral distances as sqrt(8.97^2 + 2.16^2) = 9.22m (Low Risk)
* Overall Risk: High (2)


Obstacle 30377: Located front-left. The longitudinal distance is decreasing rapidly while the lateral distance is slightly increasing. The rapid decrease in the longitudinal distance is cause for concern.
* TTC (Longitudinal): 5.17m / 1.91m/s = 2.71s (Medium Risk)
* MDC: Approximately derived from longitudinal and lateral distances as sqrt(5.17^2 + 3.45^2) = 6.21m (Low Risk)
* Overall Risk: Medium (3)


Obstacle 30378: Located front-left and moving closer longitudinally. Lateral distance is large and stable.
* TTC (Longitudinal): 10.35m / 4.32 m/s = 2.40s (Medium Risk)
* MDC: > 5.0m (Negligible Risk)
* Overall Risk: Medium (3)


Obstacle 30381: Located rear-right and approaching from behind. The longitudinal distance is negative and decreasing (becoming more negative), indicating it is getting closer from behind. The lateral distance is small and negative but also indicates motion toward the ego from the right.
* TTC (Longitudinal): 10.12m / 4.33m/s = 2.34s (Medium Risk)
* MDC: Approximately derived from longitudinal and lateral distances as sqrt(10.12^2 + 2.40^2) = 10.40m (Low Risk)
* Overall Risk: Medium (3)

Obstacle 30383: Located front-left with significant distances in both directions.  No risk.
* TTC (Longitudinal): 17.31m / 4.41m/s = 3.93s (Low Risk)
* MDC: > 5.0m (Negligible Risk)
* Overall Risk: Low (4)

Obstacle 30384: Located front-right. Both longitudinal and lateral distances are moderately large but decreasing, implying risk.
* TTC (Longitudinal): 14.25m / 4.42m/s = 3.22s (Medium Risk)
* MDC: Approximately derived from longitudinal and lateral distances as sqrt(14.25^2 + 7.70^2) = 16.19m (Low Risk)
* Overall Risk: Medium (3)
