### Analysis for Each Obstacle

#### Obstacle 30372
- **Position and Motion**: This obstacle is in the rear-left of the ego car. Its longitudinal distance has become slightly negative (-1.43 m) and lateral distance is at 1.77 m, indicating it has moved behind the ego vehicle.
- **Trajectory and Velocity**: The longitudinal velocity is moving away from the ego vehicle (-5.79 m/s), but laterally moving towards the ego vehicle (-0.96 m/s). 
- **TTC & MDC**: No imminent collision in the longitudinal direction as it is moving away. Lateral movement does present a possible medium risk due to continuous closing.
- **Risk Score**: **3 (Medium Risk)** due to the negative but near-zero lateral dimension with the recorded closing velocity.

#### Obstacle 30373
- **Position and Motion**: Front-left with both longitudinal (14.73 m) and lateral (7.54 m) distances decreasing. 
- **Trajectory and Velocity**: Decreasing longitudinal and increasing lateral distances suggest diverging paths, reducing risk.
- **TTC & MDC**: With longitudinal velocity at -2.54 m/s and lateral velocity indicating movement away, risk is minimal.
- **Risk Score**: **4 (Low Risk)** given diverging lateral trajectory and relatively long overall distances.

#### Obstacle 30376
- **Position and Motion**: Located in the front-right with decreasing longitudinal (8.97m) and constant lateral (-2.16m) distances.
- **Trajectory and Velocity**: The obstacle is closing, but the lateral distance is not zero nor rapidly changing.
- **TTC & MDC**: With a longitudinal velocity of -4.32 m/s, TTC is about 2.08s, indicating a manageable collision risk.
- **Risk Score**: **3 (Medium Risk)** due to closing longitudinal distance and trajectory.

#### Obstacle 30377
- **Position and Motion**: Positioned in the front-left with longitudinal and lateral distances of 5.17m and 3.45m.
- **Trajectory and Velocity**: Lateral distance is gradually increasing.
- **TTC & MDC**: Longitudinal distance decreases slowly with velocity -1.91 m/s, leading to a TTC of >2s.
- **Risk Score**: **4 (Low Risk)** given the manageable longitudinal approach rate and diverging lateral path.

#### Obstacle 30378
- **Position and Motion**: Also in the front-left with increasing distances (10.35 m longitudinal, 9.44 m lateral).
- **Trajectory and Velocity**: Moving further away and broadening the gap in both longitudinal and lateral dimensions.
- **TTC & MDC**: Given moving-away path, both metrics indicate minimal collision risk.
- **Risk Score**: **5 (Negligible Risk)** due to diverging trajectory and large distances.

#### Obstacle 30381
- **Position and Motion**: Located rear-right with longitudinal (-10.12 m) and lateral (-2.40 m) positions reducing further.
- **Trajectory and Velocity**: Significant positive lateral velocity (+3.03 m/s), indicating movement toward the ego's path.
- **TTC & MDC**: The lateral motion poses risk as it gets closer, medium risk due to trajectory.
- **Risk Score**: **3 (Medium Risk)** given movement towards ego laterally combined with trajectory.

#### Obstacle 30383
- **Position and Motion**: Front-left with considerable distances (17.31 m longitudinal, 12.48 m lateral).
- **Trajectory and Velocity**: Distance is consistently decreasing, but at a low rate.
- **TTC & MDC**: With considerable distances and diverging lateral path, minimal risk is noted.
- **Risk Score**: **4 (Low Risk)** since risk factors from trajectory paths of no major concern.

#### Obstacle 30384
- **Position and Motion**: Located in the front-right with a longitudinal distance of 14.25 m and lateral of -7.70 m.
- **Trajectory and Velocity**: Paths are converging but have sufficient time and space to react.
- **TTC & MDC**: Longitudinal TTC at >2.5s and lateral movement away minimizes risk.
- **Risk Score**: **4 (Low Risk)** due to safe distances and TTC indicating safe maneuvering.
