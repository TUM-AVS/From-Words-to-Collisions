At t=0.9s, Ego (30380.0) is in lanelet 1729.0 and decelerating. Obstacle 30377.0 is also in lanelet 1729.0 and is close to the Ego vehicle.  While 30377.0 is also decelerating, the trajectories and current proximity suggest a high risk of collision in the next few timesteps if the current trends continue. Obstacle 30381.0 (lanelet 580.0) is moving significantly faster than Ego was initially and is also decelerating sharply; however, it's far enough behind to be considered low risk currently.
