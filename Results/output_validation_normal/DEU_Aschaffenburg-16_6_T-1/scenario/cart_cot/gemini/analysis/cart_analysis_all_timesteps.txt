### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.
### Obstacle Analysis:
- Obstacle ID: 30372.0
- Distance Risk reason: The obstacle is in a different lanelet (1750) than the ego vehicle (1729), and their lateral positions are diverging.  The historical data shows a consistent lateral separation.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: The obstacle's velocity and acceleration pose no immediate threat based on the current trajectories. The historical data reinforces this.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 30373.0
- Distance Risk reason: This obstacle is in a different lanelet (595) and poses no risk due to significant lateral distance from the ego vehicle in lanelet 1729.  History shows consistent separation.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: The obstacle's velocity and acceleration, coupled with its distant location, pose no temporal risk.  The history confirms this.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 30376.0
- Distance Risk reason:  Located in a different lanelet (598) and far from the ego vehicle. The historical data confirms its stationary position.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: The obstacle is stationary, posing no time-related risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 30377.0
- Distance Risk reason: This obstacle is now in the same lanelet (1729) as the ego vehicle, but slightly ahead and with a small lateral offset.  Analyzing the historical positions indicates a continually decreasing distance. This merits closer attention.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: The obstacle's velocity is lower than the ego vehicle's, and both are decelerating. Historical data shows the ego vehicle is closing in, though collision is not imminent in the next few timesteps.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- Obstacle ID: 30378.0
- Distance Risk reason:  Located in a different lanelet (596) and poses no immediate risk due to lateral distance from the ego vehicle. The history shows it remains stationary.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: The obstacle is stationary and presents no risk based on its velocity or historical trajectory.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 30381.0
- Distance Risk reason: The obstacle is in a different lanelet (580). Historical data shows its Y coordinate is significantly different, and it's moving further away. 
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: Though it has a high velocity and positive acceleration, it's moving away from the ego vehicle, posing no risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 30383.0
- Distance Risk reason: This obstacle is in a different lanelet (596), laterally separated from the ego vehicle. The history indicates no imminent risk from its position.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: The obstacle's slow velocity and position mean it poses no time-dependent risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5

- Obstacle ID: 30384.0
- Distance Risk reason: Located in a different lanelet (598), laterally far from the ego vehicle and moving slowly. Historical data shows minimal change in its relative position.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason:  Given its distance and slow velocity, it poses no immediate time-related risk.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5


### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. **Most critical obstacle:** Obstacle 30377.0 is the most critical as it's in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle and the distance between them is decreasing.

2. **Trajectory Analysis:** Over the 10 timesteps, obstacle 30377.0 gradually moves closer to the ego vehicle's path. The ego vehicle is also decelerating and changing its orientation, which could increase the risk if this trend continues.

3. **Relative Positions, Velocities, and Accelerations:** The ego vehicle is approaching obstacle 30377.0 from behind. While the ego vehicle's velocity is higher, both are decelerating. The relative velocity is important to monitor.

4. **Collision Determination:** At the current timestep (0.9 seconds), a collision has not occurred. While 30377.0 presents the highest risk, it's not an immediate collision risk given current data.

5. **Reasoning:** The analysis indicates a potential collision risk with obstacle 30377.0 if current trends persist. Continued monitoring of relative positions, velocities, and accelerations in subsequent timesteps is critical to determine if evasive action is required.

    "ScenarioAnalysis": {
        "IsCollisionScenario": false,
        "Reasoning": "While obstacle 30377 poses the highest risk due to its proximity and decreasing distance to the ego vehicle in the same lanelet, at the current timestep (0.9 seconds), a collision has not occurred and is not immediately imminent. However, continuous monitoring is needed as the situation could change rapidly."
