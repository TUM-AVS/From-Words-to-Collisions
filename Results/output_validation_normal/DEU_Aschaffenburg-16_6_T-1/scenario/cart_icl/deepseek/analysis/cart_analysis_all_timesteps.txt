### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep (0.9 seconds):

### Obstacle Analysis:

1. **Obstacle ID: 30372.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Moving parallel to ego but at a safe lateral distance (~4.5m). No significant change in relative position over time.
   - **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: Low relative velocity (ego decelerating faster). No convergence in trajectories.
   - **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 4

2. **Obstacle ID: 30373.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Moving away from ego in opposite direction (~25m away).
   - **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: Increasing distance over time with divergent paths.
   - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 5

3. **Obstacle ID: 30376.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Static obstacle ~10m ahead but in adjacent lane (no lane overlap).
   - **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: Zero velocity, no movement observed.
   - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 5

4. **Obstacle ID: 30377.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Moving parallel to ego in same lanelet (1729.0) but maintaining ~14m longitudinal distance.
   - **Distance safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: Decelerating but still maintaining safe separation.
   - **Time safety score**: 4 (Low Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 4

5. **Obstacle ID: 30378.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Static obstacle ~18m away in different lane.
   - **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: Zero velocity, no movement.
   - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 5

6. **Obstacle ID: 30381.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Moving away from ego in opposite direction (~15m behind).
   - **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: Decelerating with increasing separation.
   - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 5

7. **Obstacle ID: 30383.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Static obstacle ~23m away in different lane.
   - **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: Near-zero velocity.
   - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 5

8. **Obstacle ID: 30384.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Static obstacle ~18m away in different lane.
   - **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Time Risk reason**: Near-zero velocity.
   - **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
   - **Overall Risk score**: 5

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. Ego is decelerating consistently (from 8.13 m/s to 4.32 m/s)
2. No obstacles are in immediate collision path (all either static or moving away)
3. Closest dynamic obstacle (30377.0) is maintaining safe distance in same lane
4. All other obstacles are either in different lanes or moving away
5. No convergence in trajectories observed in any obstacle's movement history
