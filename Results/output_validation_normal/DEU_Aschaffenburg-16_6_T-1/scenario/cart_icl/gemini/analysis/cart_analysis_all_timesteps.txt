### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
The ego vehicle is decelerating and changing lanes. Several obstacles are in close proximity, especially 30377, which has a converging trajectory with the ego vehicle and presents the highest risk.  While no immediate collision is detected, the scenario is potentially hazardous, requiring careful monitoring and potential evasive maneuvers. The high speeds of obstacles 30381 and 30382 behind the ego also warrant attention. No obstacles have a risk score of 0, so it's not a collision scenario yet.
