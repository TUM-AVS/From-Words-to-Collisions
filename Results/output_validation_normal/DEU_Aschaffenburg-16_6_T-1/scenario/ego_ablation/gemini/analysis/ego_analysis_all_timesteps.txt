Obstacle 30372 is behind and to the left of the ego vehicle, with a lateral distance of 1.77 m. While it is moving away longitudinally, the lateral distance is small, suggesting a potential collision risk if the ego were to move laterally to the left.

Obstacle 30376 is in front and slightly to the right, at a longitudinal distance of 8.97 m and a lateral distance of -2.16 m.  It's moving towards the ego longitudinally, posing a moderate risk.

Obstacle 30377 is the closest obstacle, located in front and to the left of the ego with a longitudinal distance of 5.17 m and a lateral distance of 3.45 m. While moving closer longitudinally, its lateral motion suggests it's moving away from the ego's path. It needs monitoring.

Obstacle 30381, behind and to the right, poses a medium risk due to its proximity (-10.12 m longitudinal, -2.40 m lateral) and movement towards the ego.

        "Reasoning": "No obstacle presents an immediate collision risk in the most recent timestep. Obstacles 30376, 30377, and 30381 present moderate risks due to their proximity and longitudinal movement toward the ego vehicle, but they are not on a direct collision course in the current timestep. Obstacle 30372, while close laterally, is moving away longitudinally."
