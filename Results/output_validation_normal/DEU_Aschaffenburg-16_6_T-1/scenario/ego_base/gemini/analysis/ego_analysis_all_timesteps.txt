At t=0.9s, Obstacle 30377 is closest to the ego vehicle longitudinally (5.17m) and laterally offset by 3.45m to the left, moving towards the ego longitudinally (-1.91 m/s) and away laterally (0.99 m/s). While the longitudinal distance is small, the lateral motion suggests 30377 might be changing lanes and not directly heading for a collision. Obstacle 30372 is also quite close laterally (1.77m on the left) but is moving away longitudinally (-1.43m). No obstacle shows an immediate risk of collision in the next timestep.

        "IsCollisionScenario": false,
        "Reasoning": "No obstacle is predicted to collide with the ego vehicle in the next timestep. Although obstacle 30377 is close longitudinally, its lateral movement suggests a lane change rather than a direct collision course. Other obstacles are either further away or moving away from the ego vehicle."
