### Safety analysis for timestep 0.9 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

**Assumptions and Clarifications:**

* The prompt mentions "adjusted distances" (adjusted_d_long, adjusted_d_lat), but these values are not provided in the scenario context.  Therefore, the analysis below uses the provided `real distance` (longitudinal and lateral) as a proxy for these missing adjusted values.  This will impact the accuracy of the risk assessment.  *You MUST provide the adjusted distances for a proper collision risk analysis.*
* TTC calculations assume constant velocity. This simplification is necessary due to the lack of consistent acceleration data but may not reflect real-world scenarios where velocities change.
* A diagonal distance will be calculated using the longitudinal and lateral distances for a more comprehensive risk assessment.

**Methodology:**

1. **Diagonal Distance:** Calculated using the Pythagorean theorem: sqrt(DTClong^2 + DTClat^2)
2. **Longitudinal TTC (TTClong):** DTClong / Vrel_long
3. **Lateral TTC (TTClat):** DTClat / Vrel_lat

**Note:** TTC values are only meaningful when the relative velocity indicates the objects are moving closer.  If the relative velocity is positive (moving away), TTC is not relevant. Negative TTC values mean a collision has likely already occurred.


### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 30372**
- Distance Risk reason:  Extremely close in both longitudinal (-1.43m) and lateral (-1.43m) directions and positioned rear-left relative to the ego vehicle. This suggests a likely collision.
- Distance safety score: 0
- Time Risk reason: Negative relative longitudinal velocity indicates likely past collision. Lateral movement also indicates high risk.
- Time safety score: 0
- Overall Risk score: 0

- **Obstacle ID: 30373**
- Distance Risk reason: Relatively safe distance (14.73m) diagonally; the obstacle is moving away laterally, further reducing risk.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason:  Low longitudinal relative velocity and increasing lateral distance decrease collision probability.
- Time safety score: 4
- Overall Risk score: 4

- **Obstacle ID: 30376**
- Distance Risk reason: Moderately close diagonal distance (8.97m) and in front-right.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: Closing longitudinally at a moderate speed. 
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3

- **Obstacle ID: 30377**
- Distance Risk reason: Very close diagonal distance (5.17m) and front-left, posing a significant risk.
- Distance safety score: 1
- Time Risk reason: Closing longitudinally, increasing lateral distance mitigates risk somewhat.
- Time safety score: 2
- Overall Risk score: 1

- **Obstacle ID: 30378**
- Distance Risk reason: Relatively safe diagonal distance (10.35m) and front-left.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: Moderate closing speed longitudinally.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3

- **Obstacle ID: 30381**
- Distance Risk reason: Moderately close diagonal distance (-10.12m) from rear-right. Lateral movement suggests increasing risk.
- Distance safety score: 2
- Time Risk reason: Positive longitudinal relative velocity means moving away from ego vehicle, but rapid lateral approach poses a concern.
- Time safety score: 2
- Overall Risk score: 2

- **Obstacle ID: 30383**
- Distance Risk reason: Safe diagonal distance (17.31m) and front-left; lateral movement slightly increases risk.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: Moderate closing speed longitudinally.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3

- **Obstacle ID: 30384**
- Distance Risk reason:  Moderately safe diagonal distance (14.25m) from front-right.
- Distance safety score: 3
- Time Risk reason: Moderate closing speed longitudinally. Slow lateral approach slightly increases risk.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3
