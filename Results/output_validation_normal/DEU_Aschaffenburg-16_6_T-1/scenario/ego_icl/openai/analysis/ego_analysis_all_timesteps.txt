## Obstacle-by-Obstacle Analysis

### Obstacle 30372
- **Motion Description**: Now in the Rear-left of the ego car, moving away longitudinally, but driving towards ego laterally.
- **Adjusted Distance**: Longitudinal approx. -1.43m, Lateral 1.77m
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal: -5.79 m/s, Lateral: -0.96 m/s

1. **Trajectory Analysis**: This obstacle began to move away longitudinally but continues to close laterally. The decreasing lateral distance is note-worthy given the object's exact alignment config.
2. **MDC Calculation**: The critical component here is the lateral distance, currently 1.77m.
3. **TTC Calculation (Lateral)**: Approx. 1.84 seconds (1.77m / 0.96 m/s).
4. **Risk Assessment**: Medium risk due to decreasing lateral distance and proximity close enough to monitor closely.

### Obstacle 30373
- **Motion Description**: In the Front-left, moving away laterally, but approaching longitudinally.
- **Adjusted Distance**: Longitudinal 14.73m, Lateral 7.54m
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal: -2.54 m/s, Lateral: 0.78 m/s

1. **Trajectory Analysis**: Longitudinal approach maintains alignment, while laterally moving away.
2. **MDC Calculation**: No immediate collision risk; lateral distance is increasing.
3. **TTC Calculation (Longitudinal)**: Approx. 5.80 seconds (14.73m / 2.54 m/s).
4. **Risk Assessment**: Low risk, trajectory indicates increased separation over time.

### Obstacle 30376
- **Motion Description**: In the Front-right, no lateral motion; approaching longitudinally.
- **Adjusted Distance**: Longitudinal 8.97m, Lateral -2.16m
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal: -4.32 m/s, Lateral: 0.00 m/s

1. **Trajectory Analysis**: Maintains exact alignment longitudinally, no lateral divergence.
2. **MDC Calculation**: Longitudinal distance is the focus. Effective approach without lateral alteration.
3. **TTC Calculation (Longitudinal)**: Approx. 2.08 seconds (8.97m / 4.32 m/s).
4. **Risk Assessment**: Medium risk due to the sustained trajectory and approaching velocity.

### Obstacle 30377
- **Motion Description**: In the Front-left, moving away laterally, but approaching longitudinally.
- **Adjusted Distance**: Longitudinal 5.17m, Lateral 3.45m
- **Relative Velocity**: Longitudinal: -1.91 m/s, Lateral: 0.99 m/s

1. **Trajectory Analysis**: Continued decreasing longitudinal distance, diverging laterally.
2. **MDC Calculation**: No immediate risk with separation increasing laterally.
3. **TTC Calculation (Longitudinal)**: Approx. 2.71 seconds (5.17m / 1.91 m/s).
4. **Risk Assessment**: Medium risk, considering proximity and trajectory.

### Remaining Obstacles (30378, 30381, 30383, 30384)
- Distance, velocity, and motion indicate trajectories likely to either increase separation or pose no immediate collision threat compared to critically aligned obstacles previously discussed.
- For each, the calculated TCC shows safe divergence, both laterally and longitudinally, with no factor intensifying to "extreme."

## Conclusion
- **Collision Scenario Identification**: Although no direct collision (Risk Score 0) or extreme alignment (Risk Score 1 with immediate convergence) conditions exist within the scenario, some obstacles (30376) pose medium risks in terms of trajectory principles.
- **Final Decision**: This is not a collision scenario based on the lack of imminent extreme conditions.
