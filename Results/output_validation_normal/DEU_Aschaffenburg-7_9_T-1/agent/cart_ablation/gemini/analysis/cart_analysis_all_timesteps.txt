Obstacle 30354 is in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle and is behind the ego vehicle. The distance between them is decreasing, but both vehicles are decelerating.  Obstacle 30358 is in a different lanelet. Although its lateral position is near the ego vehicle, the differing lanelets suggest they are on different, likely non-intersecting paths, so collision is unlikely. There are no immediate collisions. The risk from Obstacle 30354 is arguably between Medium and High, as collision is possible but not imminent within the timeframe provided if the current trends continue.  Given the deceleration rates, it's likely the risk will decrease further in the next few timesteps.
