Obstacle 30354 is in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle and is behind the ego vehicle. The distance between them is decreasing slightly over time, but both vehicles are braking (negative acceleration). While the distance is closing, the rate isn't alarming enough to warrant a risk score of 1 or 2.

Obstacle 30358 is in a different lanelet (719) than the ego vehicle (62). Given the provided positions,  there appears to be a comfortable lateral separation and no immediate collision risk.

Considering the trajectories and decelerations, neither obstacle presents an immediate collision risk.
