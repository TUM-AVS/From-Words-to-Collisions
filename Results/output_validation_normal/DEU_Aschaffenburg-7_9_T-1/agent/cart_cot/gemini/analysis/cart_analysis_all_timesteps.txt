At t=0.9s, the ego vehicle (ID 30353) is at (-128.72, 152.06) with a velocity of 9.06 m/s and an orientation of 0.94 radians.  We need to analyze its potential collision risk with two obstacles:

* **Obstacle 30354:** Located at (-138.87, 138.17) with a velocity of 11.63 m/s and an orientation of 0.94 radians. This obstacle is in the same lanelet (62) as the ego vehicle.  The relative positions suggest obstacle 30354 is behind and to the left of the ego vehicle. Since both are moving in approximately the same direction and orientation, and the ego vehicle is decelerating faster, the risk of collision appears low.  More precise calculations are needed to confirm.

* **Obstacle 30358:** Located at (-116.33, 170.43) with a velocity of 10.67 m/s and an orientation of 0.99 radians. This obstacle is in a different lanelet (719).  Its position relative to the ego suggests it is ahead and to the right. While the lanelets are different, their proximity warrants a closer look at the possibility of a lane change maneuver by either vehicle leading to a collision.

**Calculations (Approximate, based on 0.9s data):**

Since the orientations are nearly identical, we can approximate the longitudinal and lateral distances and velocities.

**Ego vs. Obstacle 30354:**
* Longitudinal distance: ~-10.15m (obstacle is behind ego)
* Lateral distance: ~13.89m (obstacle is to the left of ego)
* Longitudinal relative velocity: ~ 2.57 m/s (obstacle is catching up to ego)


**Ego vs. Obstacle 30358:**
* Longitudinal distance: ~ 12.39 m (obstacle is ahead of ego)
* Lateral distance: ~ -18.37 m (obstacle is to the right of ego)
* Longitudinal relative velocity: ~ 1.61 m/s (ego is approaching the obstacle from behind, although in different lanelet)


**Risk Assessment:**

* **Obstacle 30354:**  Although obstacle 30354 is closing the distance with the ego vehicle, the lateral separation is significant. Additionally, the ego vehicle's deceleration might further mitigate the risk.  The risk is assessed as **Low (4)**.

* **Obstacle 30358:** The lateral distance between the ego vehicle and obstacle 30358 is considerable, suggesting a low risk of immediate collision *given they remain in their current lanelets.* However, a lane change by either vehicle could drastically increase the risk. Given the available data, the risk is assessed as **Medium (3)** due to this uncertainty. This requires further analysis involving potential lane change predictions to improve accuracy.
