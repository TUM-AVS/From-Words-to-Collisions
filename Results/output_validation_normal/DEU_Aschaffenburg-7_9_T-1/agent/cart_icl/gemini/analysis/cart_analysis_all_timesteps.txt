At t=0.9s, the ego vehicle is at (-128.72, 152.06) with a velocity of 9.06 m/s. Let's analyze the two obstacles:

**Obstacle 30354:** Located at (-138.87, 138.17), this obstacle is in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle (lanelet 62).  The x-coordinate difference suggests it's behind the ego vehicle. Calculating a rough TTC based on the x-coordinates and x-component of velocity (assuming similar orientations since their orientation values are close):

* Approximate relative longitudinal position: -138.87 - (-128.72) = -10.15m (obstacle is behind)
* Approximate relative longitudinal velocity: 11.64 - 9.06 = 2.58 m/s (obstacle is approaching)
* Approximate TTC: -10.15 / 2.58 = -3.93s. The negative value indicates the obstacle is approaching from behind, but it will take a significant amount of time to reach the ego vehicle.

The lateral distance (y-coordinate difference) is |138.17 - 152.06| = 13.89m, which is substantial.  Considering the TTC and lateral distance, the risk associated with Obstacle 30354 is low.

**Obstacle 30358:** Located at (-116.33, 170.43), this obstacle is in a different lanelet (719).  It is ahead of the ego vehicle in the x-direction and significantly offset in the y-direction.

* Approximate relative longitudinal position: -116.33 - (-128.72) = 12.39m (obstacle is ahead)
* Approximate relative longitudinal velocity: 10.67 - 9.06 = 1.61 m/s (obstacle is moving slightly faster)
* Approximate TTC: 12.39 / 1.61 = 7.7s. The large positive TTC value indicates a low risk of longitudinal collision.

The lateral distance is |170.43 - 152.06| = 18.37m, further reducing the risk.  Obstacle 30358 poses negligible risk.

Since both obstacles have scores above 2 there is no need for a separate analysis.
