To evaluate the collision risks for this scenario, we focus on the final timestep at 0.9 seconds and observe the prior movements to understand motion trends and potential risks.

### Ego Vehicle 30353.0
- **Position at 0.9s**: (-128.7218, 152.0588)
- **Velocity**: 9.0633 m/s
- **Acceleration**: -2.1549 m/s²

### Obstacle 30354.0
- **Position at 0.9s**: (-138.865, 138.1685)
- **Velocity**: 11.6337 m/s
- **Acceleration**: -2.5262 m/s²

### Obstacle 30358.0
- **Position at 0.9s**: (-116.3302, 170.4254)
- **Velocity**: 10.6738 m/s
- **Acceleration**: -6.0985 m/s²

#### Analysis

1. **Obstacle 30354.0**
   - This obstacle is in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle (62.0) and behind the ego vehicle. Given the relative positioning, it poses a potential collision risk. The distance of approximately 16.5 meters (calculated using √((-128.7218 - (-138.865))² + (152.0588 - 138.1685)²)) is decreasing due to higher velocity than the ego. However, due to braking (negative acceleration), the risk remains manageable. **Medium Risk (3)**

2. **Obstacle 30358.0**
   - This obstacle is on a different lanelet (719.0) and shows a trajectory that doesn't intersect imminently with the ego vehicle. It moves away laterally, and no immediate threat is observed. **Negligible Risk (5)**

Based on the analysis, Obstacle 30354 is approaching the Ego Vehicle from behind but due to its reduced acceleration, immediate danger is mitigated to a Medium Risk Level. No obstacles present an extreme risk or collision:
