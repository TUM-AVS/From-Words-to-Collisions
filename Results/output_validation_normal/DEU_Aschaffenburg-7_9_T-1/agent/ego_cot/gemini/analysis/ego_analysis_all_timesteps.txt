### Safety analysis for timestep 0.9s: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

### Obstacle Analysis:

**- Obstacle ID: 30354**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 30354 is behind the ego vehicle at a longitudinal distance of -12.69m and a lateral distance of -12.69m.  While it's approaching, the current distance poses no immediate risk.
- Distance safety score: 4
- Time Risk reason: The closing longitudinal velocity suggests a potential collision risk if the current trend continues.  More data is needed to ascertain a precise TTC. However, the lateral distance combined with the relative velocity makes a lateral collision unlikely.
- Time safety score: 3
- Overall Risk score: 3

**- Obstacle ID: 30358**
- Distance Risk reason: Obstacle 30358 is in front of the ego vehicle at a longitudinal distance of 17.63m and a lateral distance of 17.63m, posing no risk.
- Distance safety score: 5
- Time Risk reason: The obstacle is moving away from the ego vehicle longitudinally and laterally.  No collision risk is foreseen.
- Time safety score: 5
- Overall Risk score: 5
