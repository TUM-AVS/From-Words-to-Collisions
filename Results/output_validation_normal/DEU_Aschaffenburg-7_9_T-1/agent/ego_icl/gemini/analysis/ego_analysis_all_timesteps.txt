Obstacle 30354:
- This obstacle is behind the ego vehicle and approaching.
- Lateral distance is consistently 0.00m, indicating it is in the same lane.
- Longitudinal distance is decreasing across timesteps, confirming it is getting closer.
- At the last timestep (0.9s), longitudinal distance is -12.69m and relative longitudinal velocity is 2.57 m/s.
- TTC = 12.69 / 2.57 ≈ 4.94s. This falls under Low Risk (4).
- MDC is primarily based on the consistent 0.0m lateral distance. With the closing longitudinal distance and velocity, this obstacle is very close to the ego's trajectory.  However, the longitudinal distance is still manageable for the MDC to be 5 and risk is low, so risk is low.

Obstacle 30358:
- This obstacle is in front of the ego vehicle and moving away.
- Lateral distance is consistently 0.00m, indicating it is in the same lane.
- Longitudinal distance is increasing across timesteps, confirming it is moving further away.
- At the last timestep (0.9s), longitudinal distance is 17.63m and relative longitudinal velocity is 1.60 m/s.
- TTC = 17.63 / 1.60 ≈ 11.02s. This indicates Negligible Risk (5).
- MDC is primarily based on the 0.0m lateral distance, but given the increasing longitudinal separation, MDC is also high. The MDC and Risk is 5
