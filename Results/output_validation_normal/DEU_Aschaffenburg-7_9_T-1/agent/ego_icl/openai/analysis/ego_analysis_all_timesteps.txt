In the most recent timestep (0.9 seconds), we have two obstacles, Obstacle 30354 and Obstacle 30358, with adjusted distances and motions to consider:

### Obstacle 30354 Analysis:
- **Position:** Behind the ego vehicle
- **Adjusted Distances:** Longitudinal -12.69 m, Lateral 0.00 m
- **Relative Velocity:** Longitudinal 2.57 m/s, Lateral -0.04 m/s
- **Relative Acceleration:** Longitudinal -0.22 m/s², Lateral -0.30 m/s²
- **Motion Description:** Driving toward the ego car from behind, exact lateral alignment.

**Trajectory Analysis:**
- The obstacle has been moving toward the ego vehicle, as the longitudinal distance is decreasing over time.

**Risk Calculation:**
- **Longitudinal Risk:**
  - **TTC:** Using the longitudinal distance and relative velocity, TTC = 12.69 / 2.57 = approximately 4.94 seconds.
  - **MDC:** Since the obstacle is directly behind, the MDC is examined longitudinally and remains around 12.69 meters.
  
**Risk Assessment:**
- Given a TTC just under 5 seconds, the situation is assessed as Low Risk (4), primarily due to the decreasing distance but still having decent margins and time to react.

### Obstacle 30358 Analysis:
- **Position:** In front of the ego vehicle
- **Adjusted Distances:** Longitudinal 17.63 m, Lateral 0.00 m
- **Relative Velocity:** Longitudinal 1.60 m/s, Lateral 0.52 m/s
- **Relative Acceleration:** Longitudinal -2.07 m/s², Lateral -3.36 m/s²
- **Motion Description:** Moving away longitudinally, exact lateral alignment.

**Trajectory Analysis:**
- This obstacle has been progressively moving away from the ego vehicle, as indicated by increasing longitudinal distances.

**Risk Calculation:**
- **Longitudinal Risk:**
  - **TTC:** Since the relative velocity indicates separation, the calculation for TTC isn't strictly necessary; however, if opposite, this would imply TTC > 5 seconds.
  - **MDC:** With the longitudinal distance increasing to 17.63 meters, the MDC is also high.

**Risk Assessment:**
- With no immediate convergence in trajectory and an increasing distance, this obstacle is categorized at Negligible Risk (5).
