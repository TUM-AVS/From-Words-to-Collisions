At t=0.9s, Ego is in lanelet 62.

Obstacle 30354 is also in lanelet 62.  The x-positions are converging, though obstacle 30354 is still ~10m ahead.  However, the y-positions are quite close (152.0588 vs 138.1685), suggesting a possible lane change or other maneuver by one of the vehicles could lead to a collision very soon. This warrants an extreme risk assessment.

Obstacle 30358 is in a different lanelet (719). While its x-position is closer to Ego than Obstacle 30354, the different lanelets suggest a lower immediate risk, barring unexpected maneuvers.  Therefore, we do not consider this an extreme risk.
