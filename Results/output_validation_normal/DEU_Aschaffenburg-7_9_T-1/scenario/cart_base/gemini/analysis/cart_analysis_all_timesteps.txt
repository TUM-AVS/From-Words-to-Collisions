At t=0.9s, Ego is in lanelet 62.

Obstacle 30354 is also in lanelet 62.  The x-positions are converging, but are still separated by approximately 10 meters. Given the current velocities and accelerations, a collision in the next timestep is not imminent, though definitely possible within the next few timesteps if the trends continue. This is a High risk (2) or Medium Risk (3), but not Extreme Risk (1).

Obstacle 30358 is in a different lanelet (719). While its position is closer to Ego in terms of raw distance, the different lanelets suggest they are not on a direct collision course. Thus, the risk is Low (4) or Negligible (5).

Since no obstacles present Extreme Risk (1) or Collision Risk (0), IsCollisionScenario is false.

        "IsCollisionScenario": false,
        "Reasoning": "No obstacles pose an immediate collision risk at t=0.9s. Obstacle 30354 is approaching but not extremely close yet, and Obstacle 30358 is in a different lanelet."
