### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep:

### Obstacle Analysis:
#### Obstacle ID: 30354.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is in the same lanelet (62.0) as the ego vehicle and has been consistently moving towards the ego vehicle over the past timesteps. The distance between them has decreased from ~10.8m to ~10.1m.
- **Distance safety score**: 2 (High Risk)
- **Time Risk reason**: The relative velocity is decreasing (ego decelerating faster than obstacle), but the obstacle is still approaching. TTC is ~10.1m / (11.6337 - 9.0633) ≈ 3.93s.
- **Time safety score**: 3 (Medium Risk)
- **Overall Risk score**: 2 (High Risk)

#### Obstacle ID: 30358.0
- **Distance Risk reason**: The obstacle is in a different lanelet (719.0) and moving away from the ego vehicle. The distance has increased from ~18.2m to ~18.4m over the timesteps.
- **Distance safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- **Time Risk reason**: The obstacle is decelerating rapidly (-6.0985 m/s²) and moving away. No risk of collision.
- **Time safety score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- **Overall Risk score**: 5 (Negligible Risk)

### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
1. Obstacle 30354.0 is in the same lanelet as ego and approaching, but at a decreasing rate due to ego's stronger deceleration.
2. Obstacle 30358.0 is in a different lanelet and moving away with no collision risk.
3. No immediate collision (risk score 0) or extreme risk (risk score 1) obstacles present.
4. Scenario is not a collision scenario but requires monitoring of obstacle 30354.0.
