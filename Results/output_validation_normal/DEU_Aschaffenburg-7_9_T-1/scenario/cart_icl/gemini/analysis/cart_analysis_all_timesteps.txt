### Chain of Thought Scenario Analysis:
No obstacles pose an immediate collision risk. Obstacles in the same lanelet as the ego vehicle are behind and moving slower, indicating no imminent collision. Other obstacles are in different lanelets and maintain safe distances. Therefore, this is not a collision scenario.
