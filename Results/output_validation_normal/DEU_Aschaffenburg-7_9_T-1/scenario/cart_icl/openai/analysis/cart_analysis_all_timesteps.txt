### Safety analysis for the most recent timestep (0.9 seconds):

#### Obstacle Analysis:

1. **Obstacle ID: 30347.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: This obstacle has been stationary throughout the scenario with a significant distance from the ego vehicle. It remains outside direct collision paths based on its consistent lack of movement.
   - **Distance safety score**: 5
   - **Time Risk reason**: No movement results in zero relative velocity with respect to the ego vehicle, therefore no time-based risk of collision.
   - **Time safety score**: 5
   - **Overall Risk score**: 5

2. **Obstacle ID: 30348.0**
   - **Distance Risk reason**: Located far from the ego vehicle and moving in a different lane let. Position and trajectory pose no immediate proximity risk.
   - **Distance safety score**: 5
