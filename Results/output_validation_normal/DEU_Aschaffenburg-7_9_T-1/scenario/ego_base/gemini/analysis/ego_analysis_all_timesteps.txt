At t=0.9s, Obstacle 30354 is behind the ego vehicle, moving closer at 2.57 m/s with a longitudinal distance of -12.69m. Although the closing rate is relatively high, it's not an immediate collision risk given the current distance. Obstacle 30358 is in front of the ego vehicle and moving away at 1.60 m/s, posing no risk.  Neither obstacle presents an immediate collision risk in the next timestep.

**Risk Levels and Definitions:**
<Collision (Score: 0)>: Actual collision has occurred or is unavoidable within the next timestep.
<Extreme Risk (Score: 1)>: Immediate collision or very high likelihood of impact. Urgent action is required.
<High Risk (Score: 2)>: Close to collision or highly probable collision path. Needs prompt attention and quick manoeuvring.
<Medium Risk (Score: 3)>: Moderate collision risk but manageable with timely reactions and proper strategies.
<Low Risk (Score: 4)>: Minimal collision risk. The situation is controllable with sufficient time to react.
<Negligible Risk (Score: 5)>: No significant collision risk. Obstacles are either moving away or far enough not to interfere.
