### Safety analysis for timestep 0.9 seconds: Here's the evaluation of each obstacle according to the provided metrics and calculations.

**Missing Information:** The provided scenario lacks crucial information for accurate TTC and MDC calculation.  Specifically, it's missing:

* **Ego vehicle's dimensions:**  Needed to understand the safety margins around the ego vehicle.  The provided "adjusted distances" are mentioned but not actually given.  I will assume, for demonstration purposes, that the adjusted distances are roughly equivalent to the provided real distances, but this is a significant limitation of this analysis.
* **Clear definitions of "front," "behind," etc.:**  Are these based on the ego vehicle's heading, or its direction of travel?  This affects the interpretation of longitudinal and lateral distances.  I will assume they are relative to the ego vehicle's heading.
* **Consistent lateral movement for Obstacle 30354:**  The lateral velocity and acceleration fluctuate around zero, making it hard to determine if it's truly on a collision path.

**Assumptions and Simplifications:** Due to the missing information, I will make the following assumptions:

* Adjusted distances are equal to real distances.
* "Front" and "Behind" are relative to the ego vehicle's heading.
* Obstacle 30354's lateral movement is negligible.


### Obstacle Analysis:

- **Obstacle ID: 30354**
- Distance Risk reason:  Although behind the ego vehicle, it is closing rapidly and the adjusted longitudinal distance is relatively small (assumed -12.69m).  The exact lateral alignment raises concern.
- Distance safety score: 2 (High Risk)
- Time Risk reason:  Without accurate adjusted distances and ego vehicle size, a precise TTC cannot be calculated.  However, the closing longitudinal velocity (2.57 m/s) and relatively small distance suggest a short TTC.
- Time safety score: 2 (High Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 2 (High Risk)

- **Obstacle ID: 30358**
- Distance Risk reason: Located in front of the ego vehicle at a substantial adjusted longitudinal distance (assumed 17.63m) and moving away.
- Distance safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- Time Risk reason: Moving away from the ego vehicle longitudinally.
- Time safety score: 5 (Negligible Risk)
- Overall Risk score: 5 (Negligible Risk)


### Summary in JSON Format:
```json
{
  "CollisionObstacle": null,
  "ExtremeRiskObstacle": null,
  "IsCollisionScenario": false, 
  "Justification": "While Obstacle 30354 presents a high risk due to its closing velocity and proximity, it's not classified as an immediate collision at the last timestep (0.9s). More data, especially accurate adjusted distances and ego vehicle dimensions, are needed for a definitive collision assessment."
}
```


**Important Note:** This analysis is based on limited information and assumptions.  Providing the missing data (adjusted distances, ego vehicle size, clear definitions of relative directions) is crucial for a more accurate and reliable safety assessment.  The current analysis highlights potential risk but cannot definitively confirm a collision.
