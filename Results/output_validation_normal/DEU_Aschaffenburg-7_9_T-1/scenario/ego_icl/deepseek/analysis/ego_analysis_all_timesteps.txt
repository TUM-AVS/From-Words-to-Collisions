### Obstacle-by-Obstacle Analysis

#### Obstacle 30354 (Behind Ego Car)
- **Most Recent Timestep (0.9s):**
  - **Adjusted Distance:** Longitudinal -12.69 m, Lateral 0.00 m
  - **Relative Velocity:** Longitudinal 2.57 m/s (approaching), Lateral -0.04 m/s (negligible)
  - **Motion:** Driving toward the ego car from behind with exact lateral alignment.
  
- **Trajectory Analysis:**
  - Over the timesteps, the longitudinal distance decreases from -13.44 m to -12.69 m, indicating the obstacle is closing in on the ego car.
  - The lateral distance remains 0.00 m, meaning the obstacle is perfectly aligned behind the ego car.
  - The longitudinal relative velocity is consistently positive (approaching), increasing from -0.46 m/s to 2.57 m/s, showing acceleration toward the ego car.

- **TTC Calculation:**
  - Longitudinal TTC = Distance / Relative Velocity = 12.69 / 2.57 ≈ 4.94 seconds
  - Lateral TTC: Not applicable (lateral velocity is negligible and not converging).

- **MDC Calculation:**
  - Since the obstacle is directly behind and aligned laterally, MDC is effectively the longitudinal distance (12.69 m).

- **Risk Assessment:**
  - **Longitudinal Risk:** TTC ≈ 4.94s → Low Risk (4)
  - **Lateral Risk:** No Risk (5) (no lateral convergence)
  - **Overall Risk:** Low Risk (4) (no imminent collision threat).

#### Obstacle 30358 (Front of Ego Car)
- **Most Recent Timestep (0.9s):**
  - **Adjusted Distance:** Longitudinal 17.63 m, Lateral 0.00 m
  - **Relative Velocity:** Longitudinal 1.60 m/s (moving away), Lateral 0.52 m/s (moving away)
  - **Motion:** Moving away longitudinally with exact lateral alignment.

- **Trajectory Analysis:**
  - The longitudinal distance increases from 16.40 m to 17.63 m, indicating the obstacle is moving away from the ego car.
  - The lateral distance remains 0.00 m, meaning the obstacle is perfectly aligned in front of the ego car.
  - The longitudinal relative velocity is positive but decreasing (from 1.88 m/s to 1.60 m/s), showing the obstacle is moving away but decelerating slightly.

- **TTC Calculation:**
  - Not applicable (relative velocity is moving away in both dimensions).

- **MDC Calculation:**
  - Since the obstacle is moving away, MDC is effectively the current longitudinal distance (17.63 m).

- **Risk Assessment:**
  - **Longitudinal Risk:** No Risk (5) (moving away)
  - **Lateral Risk:** No Risk (5) (moving away)
  - **Overall Risk:** No Risk (5) (no collision threat).

### Collision Scenario Determination
- Neither obstacle poses a collision (risk 0) or extreme risk (risk 1).
- Obstacle 30354 is approaching from behind but is still at a safe distance (Low Risk).
- Obstacle 30358 is moving away from the ego car (No Risk).
