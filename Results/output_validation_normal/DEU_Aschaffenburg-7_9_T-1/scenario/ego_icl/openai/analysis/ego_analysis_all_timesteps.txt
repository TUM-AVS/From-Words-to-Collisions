### Analysis for Each Obstacle:

#### Obstacle 30354 (Behind the Ego Vehicle):
- **Trajectory Analysis:**
  - Across timesteps, the obstacle is consistently moving towards the ego vehicle with longitudinal distances from -13.44m to -12.69m in 0.9 seconds.
  - Longitudinal relative velocity increased consistently, indicating the obstacle is closing in on the ego vehicle.

- **Calculations:**
  - **Adjusted Longitudinal Distance:** -12.69 meters (behind ego)
  - **Relative Velocity (Longitudinal):** 2.57 m/s (closing in)
  - **Time-to-Collision (TTC):** TTC = |Distance| / |Relative Velocity| = 12.69 / 2.57 â‰ˆ 4.94 seconds
  - **MDC (Minimum Distance to Collision):** As the path is parallel, MDC assumes infinite; only longitudinal distance is considered.

- **Risk Assessment:**
  - Given the TTC of 4.94 seconds, the risk category is Low Risk (4).
  - The obstacle, although closing in, has a moderate time before potential impact or the need for intervention.

#### Obstacle 30358 (In Front of the Ego Vehicle):
- **Trajectory Analysis:**
  - This obstacle is continually moving away from the ego vehicle with longitudinal distances increasing from 16.40m to 17.63m.
  - Relative velocity indicates the obstacle is moving away from the ego vehicle.

- **Calculations:**
  - **Adjusted Longitudinal Distance:** 17.63 meters (in front of ego)
  - **Relative Velocity (Longitudinal):** -1.60 m/s (moving away, not applicable for a collision)
  - **Time-to-Collision (TTC):** Not applicable, as the obstacle is moving away.
  - **MDC (Minimum Distance to Collision):** Given the increasing path, collision path unlikely.

- **Risk Assessment:**
  - The obstacle is moving away, longitudinal distance increasing, thus No Risk (5).

### Conclusion:
- Neither obstacle presents an imminent collision risk. Obstacle 30354 is at Low Risk due to a relatively moderate TTC, indicating a scenario where monitoring is required, but no immediate intervention is needed.
  
- **Final Determination:**
  - This is **not** a collision scenario since no obstacles have a risk score of 0 or 1.
